If you do not vote, if you do not submit your proxy, or\nyou fail to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger\nproposal.\nApproval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires that the\nnumber of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d such proposal.\nAttendance and Voting at the Special Meeting (see page 29)\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a \u201cshareholder of record\u201d and you may vote your\nshares virtually at the special meeting or by submitting a proxy by mail, over\n3\nTable of Contents\nthe internet, or by telephone If you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, you will be able to vote your shares electronically.

If you return an executed proxy and do not indicate how\nyou wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of Avalara common stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal. Under applicable\nstock exchange rules, banks, brokers, and other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the\nspecial meeting are non-routine matters, and hence banks, brokers, and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions.\nTherefore, it is important that you cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.\nSolicitation of Proxies (see page 30)\nThe Board is soliciting your proxy, and Avalara will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated (\u201cInnisfree\u201d) has been retained\nto assist with the solicitation of proxies. Avalara will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $45,000 and will reimburse Innisfree for its reasonable out-\nof-pocket expenses for these and related services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies\nand proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks, and other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of Avalara common\nstock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by\ntelephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Avalara\u2019s directors,\nofficers, and employees.\nAdjournments and Postponements (see page 30)\nIn addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, Avalara shareholders are also\nbeing asked to approve the adjournment proposal, which will enable the adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional\nvotes in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal or to ensure\nthat any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to Avalara shareholders. If no quorum is present at the\nspecial meeting, the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara common stock, present in person\nat the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date, or time.\nAssuming\n4\nTable of Contents\na quorum is present, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara common stock present and entitled to vote\non the adjournment proposal will be required to approve the adjournment proposal. In addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it\ncommences. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional votes on the merger proposal, shareholders\nwho have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals. If you submit a proxy and\ndo not indicate how you wish to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.\nAvalara may postpone, recess or adjourn the special meeting (i) to the extent required by law or fiduciary duty, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time\nto solicit additional proxies to the extent Avalara reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the approval of the merger proposal for a period of\nup to 10 business days, or (iii) if as of the time for which the special meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Avalara common\nstock represented (either in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business\nof the special meeting.\nThe Merger\nStructure of the Merger (see page 32)\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the WBCA, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with\nand into Avalara, with Avalara continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nMerger Consideration\u2014What Shareholders Will Receive in the Merger (see page 32)\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each outstanding share of Avalara common stock (other\nthan shares that may be held by Avalara as treasury stock or shares owned by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or held directly by\nParent or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub)), and other than any shares owned by any shareholder who has properly\nexercised and perfected such holder\u2019s demand for dissenters\u2019 rights pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and who has not effectively\nwithdrawn or otherwise irrevocably lost or failed to perfect such holder\u2019s dissenters\u2019 rights, will be automatically converted into the right to receive\n$93.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nTreatment of Avalara Equity Awards (see page 32)\nThe merger agreement provides that outstanding equity-based awards issued under Avalara\u2019s equity incentive plans will be treated as set forth\nbelow:\nOptions. Each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Avalara common stock (an \u201cOption\u201d), whether vested or unvested, will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock\nsubject to such Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the exercise price per share under such Option,\nless any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each Option with an exercise price per share greater than or equal to\nthe per share merger consideration will be cancelled automatically at the effective time for no consideration.\nRestricted Stock Units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). Each outstanding RSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time or that vests as a\nresult of the consummation of the merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes\nrequired to be withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such vested RSU, multiplied by\n(ii) the per share merger consideration. Each outstanding RSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the\n5\nTable of Contents\neffective time will be converted into the contingent right to receive from Parent or Avalara an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) (each, a\n\u201cConverted Cash Award\u201d) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such unvested RSU, multiplied by (ii) the per\nshare merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Unless provided otherwise in the merger\nagreement, each such Converted Cash Award will continue to have, and be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions that applied to the\ncorresponding unvested RSU forfeited immediately prior to the effective time.\nPerformance Share Units (\u201cPSUs\u201d). Each outstanding PSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted\ninto the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total\nnumber of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such vested PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award\nagreement), multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration. Each outstanding PSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time will be converted into (without interest) a Converted Cash Award with respect to an amount equal to (i) the total number of shares of\nAvalara common stock subject to such unvested PSU (as determined in accordance with the merger agreement), multiplied by (ii) the per share\nmerger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each such Converted Cash Award will have,\nand be subject to, the vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement to the corresponding unvested PSUs forfeited\nimmediately prior to the effective time.\nEffects on Avalara if the Merger Is Not Completed (see page 33)\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by Avalara shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Avalara shareholders will not\nreceive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, Avalara will remain an independent public company and shares of\nAvalara common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic\nreports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Avalara expects that management will operate Avalara\u2019s business in a manner similar\nto that in which it is being operated today and that Avalara shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which\nthey are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Avalara operates and adverse\neconomic conditions. Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be\ncompleted, it is likely that the price of Avalara\u2019s common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of\nAvalara\u2019s common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, if the merger is not\ncompleted, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock.\nFurther, if the merger agreement is validly terminated under certain specified circumstances, Avalara may be required to pay Parent a termination fee\nof $242.329 million or Parent may be required to pay Avalara a termination fee of $484.659 million. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d\nbeginning on page 100 for a discussion of the circumstances under which such fee may be payable.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that Avalara shareholders vote:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (see page 53)\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated August 8,\n2022, that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon\n6\nTable of Contents\nand subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other\nthan Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares\n(as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a\nfinancial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 8, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory\nservices and its opinion for the information and assistance of Avalara\u2019s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. The\nGoldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Avalara\u2019s common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any\nother matter. For additional information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC\u201d and the full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.\nInterests of Avalara\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger (see page 65)\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, you should be aware that, aside from their interests\nas Avalara shareholders, Avalara\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests\nof Avalara shareholders generally. These interests are described in more detail below and, with respect to the named executive officers of Avalara,\nare quantified in the \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Avalara\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\u2014280G Mitigation Actions\u2014Quantification\nof Potential Merger-Related Payments to Named Executive Officers\u201d beginning on page 69.\nWith regard to our non-employee directors serving on the Board, these interests relate to the impact of the transaction on the directors\u2019 outstanding\nequity awards and the directors\u2019 rights to indemnification pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.\nWith regard to our executive officers, these interests include the possible receipt of the following types of payments and benefits that may be\ntriggered by or otherwise relate to the merger, assuming the merger occurred on November 1, 2022 and, where applicable, the executives\u2019 employment\nwas terminated by us without \u201ccause\u201d or, in some cases, by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined below) on such date:\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s executive officers and directors hold equity-based awards that will be afforded the treatment described in the section of\nthis proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Treatment of Avalara Equity Awards\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s executive officers are party to existing employment and incentive agreements with the Company that provide for\nseverance benefits in the case of a qualifying termination of employment within specified periods following a change in control, which\nwill include completion of the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage following the Merger\nunder the merger agreement. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Indemnification of\nDirectors and Officers and Insurance.\u201d\nFinancing of the Merger (see page 71)\nThe obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is not subject to any financing condition. It is anticipated that the total amount\nof funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the\nmerger by Parent and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, will be approximately $10 billion in cash. Parent has obtained equity and debt\nfinancing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the aggregate\n7\nTable of Contents\nproceeds of which, together with cash on hand at Avalara, will be used by Parent to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees and\nexpenses of Parent and Merger Sub and to finance the fundamental change offer for the Company\u2019s outstanding convertible debt. These equity and\ndebt financing commitments will be funded through a combination of the following:\n\u2022\ncash equity commitments by Vista Funds in an aggregate amount up to $3.875 billion on the terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth in the equity commitment letters. Additionally, certain institutional investors, severally and not jointly, have committed, pursuant\nto separate equity commitment letters, an aggregate amount of $2.6 billion, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in each\nequity commitment letter and as further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d beginning on page\n71\u037e and\n\u2022\ndebt financing commitments from the debt financing sources consisting of (1) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate\nprincipal amount equal to $2.5 billion, and (2) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $250.0\nmillion, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a commitment letter and as further described in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 71.\nRegulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 72)\nUnder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (\u201cHSR Act\u201d), we cannot complete the merger until we have given\nnotification and furnished information to the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the\n\u201cDOJ\u201d), and until the applicable waiting period has expired or has been terminated. On August 22, 2022, Avalara and an affiliate of Vista each filed a\npremerger notification and report form under the HSR Act, as a result of which the applicable waiting period would expire on September 21, 2022, at\n11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, unless otherwise earlier terminated or extended by the antitrust authorities.\nGenerally under the merger agreement, each of Avalara and Parent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (x) to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under\nthe HSR Act and (y) to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any Antitrust Law (as defined in the\nmerger agreement) as soon as practicable, subject to certain limitations, as further described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Regulatory Clearances and Approvals\nRequired for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 72.\nWhile we have no reason to believe it will not be possible to obtain regulatory approvals, or to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, there is no\ncertainty that these approvals will be obtained.\nLitigation Related to the Merger (see page 73)\nTwo purported Avalara shareholders have each filed a complaint relating to the merger in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork. The complaints, captioned James Albrecht v. Avalara, Inc., et al., No. 22-cv-7486 (filed September 1, 2022) and Ryan O\u2019Dell v. Avalara, Inc., et\nal., No. 22-cv-7720 (filed September 9, 2022), each names Avalara and its directors as defendants and alleges, among other things, that the\ndefendants filed or caused to be filed a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the merger in violation of\nSections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek as relief, among other things, injunctive relief preventing defendants from filing a\ndefinitive proxy statement and from consummating the merger unless additional disclosures are made, rescission of the merger in the event the\nmerger is consummated or awarding of rescissory damages, relief directing the defendants to account to plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result\nof the alleged violations, and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees.\n8\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, Avalara has received demand letters from purported Avalara shareholders seeking additional disclosures in the preliminary proxy\nstatement.\nAvalara believes the claims asserted in the lawsuits and the demand letters are without merit. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of\nthe merger may also be filed or received in the future.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 108)\nThe exchange of Avalara common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may\nalso be taxable under state, local, or other tax laws. You should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 108 and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your\nparticular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nDissenters\u2019 Rights (see page 74)\nUnder Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, instead of receiving the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger\nagreement, holders of Avalara\u2019s common stock are entitled to dissent from and obtain payment of the fair value of their shares in cash together with\naccrued interest from the effective time, if the merger is consummated. Any Avalara shareholder electing to dissent from the merger must strictly\ncomply with all procedures required under the WBCA. The procedures are summarized in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Dissenters\u2019 Rights\u201d beginning on page 74\nand a copy of the relevant statutory provisions is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nANY AVALARA SHAREHOLDER WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE DISSENTERS\u2019 RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO\nDO SO SHOULD REVIEW ANNEX C CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY AND SHOULD CONSULT THEIR LEGAL ADVISOR, SINCE\nFAILURE TO TIMELY AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH THEREIN WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH\nRIGHTS.\nExpected Timing of the Merger\nAssuming timely receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, we anticipate completing the merger in the second half\nof 2022. However, the merger is subject to various regulatory clearances and approvals and other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside\nof the control of Avalara or Parent could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time\nbetween the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required\nclearances and approvals and the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the merger.\nAcquisition Proposals (see page 88)\nFrom August 8, 2022 until the effective time or, if earlier, the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, Avalara will not,\nwill cause its subsidiaries not to, and will direct and use reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective representatives not to, directly or\nindirectly:\n\u2022\ninitiate, solicit, or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers with\nrespect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants\nand Agreements\u2014Acquisition Proposals\u201d beginning on page 88) or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to\nlead to any Acquisition Proposal\u037e\n9\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nengage in, continue, or otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its or its subsidiaries\u2019\npersonnel, properties, books and records or any confidential information or data to, any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or\nany inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\napprove, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal\u037e or\n\u2022\nnegotiate, execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, or other\nsimilar definitive agreement for any Acquisition Proposal\u037e provided, that it is understood and agreed that any determination or action\nby the Board expressly permitted under the merger agreement will not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a breach or violation of, or give\nParent a right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, Avalara or its Board may, subject to compliance with certain provisions of the\nmerger agreement:\n\u2022\ntake and disclose to Avalara shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act\n(or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), make a\ncustomary \u201cstop-look-and-listen\u201d communication to the shareholders of Avalara pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or\nany similar communications to the shareholders of Avalara) or from (subject to compliance with certain provisions of the merger\nagreement) making any legally required disclosure to shareholders with regard to the transaction contemplated by the merger\nagreement or an Acquisition Proposal\u037e provided, that the Board may not make a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014Acquisition Proposals\u201d beginning on page 88) except to the\nextent otherwise permitted by the merger agreement\u037e or\n\u2022\nprior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and\nAgreements\u2014Acquisition Proposals\u201d beginning on page 88):\n\u2022\ncontact and engage in discussions with any person or group and their respective representatives who has made an Acquisition\nProposal that did not, directly or indirectly, result from or principally arise out of a material breach of the

representatives who has made an Acquisition\nProposal after August 8, 2022 that did not, directly or indirectly, result from or principally arise out of a material breach of the\nmerger agreement (which negotiations or discussions need not be solely for clarification purposes) and (b) provide access to the\nAvalara\u2019s or any of its subsidiaries\u2019 properties, books and records and providing information or data in response to a request\ntherefor by a person who has made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after August 8, 2022 that did not, directly or indirectly, result\nfrom or principally arise out of a material breach of the merger agreement, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), if prior to and as a\ncondition precedent to taking such action if the Board (i) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside\nlegal counsel and financial advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute,\nresult in or lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,\nthat the failure to do so could be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (iii) has\nreceived from the person so requesting such information an executed acceptable confidentiality agreement\u037e provided, that\nAvalara shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information or data that is provided to any person given such\naccess that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)\nfollowing the time it is provided to such person\u037e\n10\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nmake a change of recommendation (to the extent permitted by and made in accordance with the merger agreement)\u037e or\n\u2022\nresolve, authorize, commit, or agree to take any of the foregoing actions, only to the extent such actions would be permitted by\nthe foregoing clauses above.\nNotwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote (as defined in the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014Acquisition Proposals\u201d beginning on page 88), if the Board\ndetermines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, in response to a bona fide and written Acquisition\nProposal that did not, directly or indirectly, result from or principally arise out of a material breach of the merger agreement, that such Acquisition\nProposal would constitute a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014\nAcquisition Proposals\u201d beginning on page 88), Avalara or its Board may, if the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with its\nfinancial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties under applicable law, (x) effect a Change of Recommendation or (y) terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the merger\nagreement in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal\u037e provided, that Avalara pays to Parent any\ncompany termination payment required to be paid pursuant to the merger agreement and comply with the applicable provisions thereunder as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014Acquisition Proposals\u201d beginning on page 88.\nPrior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Board may effect a Change of Recommendation if (x) an Intervening Event has occurred, and (y)\nprior to taking such action, the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor(s), that\nfailure to take such action in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary\nduties under applicable law.\nConditions to the Merger (see page 97)\nThe obligations of each of Avalara, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement are subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver by Avalara and Parent at or prior to the effective time of the\nfollowing conditions:\n\u2022\nthe Company Requisite Vote will have been

If no quorum is present at\nthe special meeting, the meeting may nonetheless be adjourned by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of\nAvalara common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter.\nQ.\nHow are Avalara\u2019s directors and executives intending to vote?\nA.\nAs of September 8, 2022, the directors and executive officers of Avalara either directly or through their affiliates, collectively, beneficially owned and\nwere entitled to vote 1,421,237 shares of Avalara common stock, representing approximately 1.6% of the shares of Avalara common stock\noutstanding on that date. Avalara currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote such shares of Avalara common stock in\nfavor of the foregoing proposals, although none of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so.\nQ.\nWhat factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the merger agreement and recommending the approval of the merger proposal, the\nnamed executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal?\nA.\nIn reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and to recommend that our\nshareholders approve the merger proposal, the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, and the adjournment\nproposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed merger\nagreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed description of these\nfactors, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 46.\n16\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nDo you expect the merger to be taxable to Avalara shareholders?\nA.\nThe exchange of Avalara common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may\nalso be taxable under state, local, or other tax laws. You should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 108 and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your\nparticular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nQ.\nWhat other effects will the merger have on Avalara?\nA.\nIf the merger is completed, Avalara common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Avalara will no\nlonger be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Avalara common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules,\nand regulations. Following the completion of the merger, Avalara common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer have any\ninterest in Avalara\u2019s future earnings or growth\u037e each share of Avalara common stock you hold will represent only the right to receive $93.50 in cash,\nwithout interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ.\nWhen is the merger expected to be completed?\nA.\nAssuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our shareholders of the merger proposal, the parties to the\nmerger agreement expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2022. However, Avalara cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at\nall. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of shareholder approval of the merger proposal and the receipt of\ncertain regulatory approvals, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time and we cannot guarantee that the merger will be\ncompleted.\nQ.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA.\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by Avalara shareholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Avalara shareholders will\nnot receive any payment for their shares of Avalara common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Avalara will remain an independent\npublic company and shares of Avalara common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and\nwe will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the\ntermination of $242.329 million or Parent may be required to pay Avalara a termination fee of $484.659 million, as described under \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 100.\nQ.\nDo any of Avalara\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a shareholder?\nA.\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive\nofficers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. The Board was aware of\nand considered these differing interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the\nmerger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement be approved by Avalara shareholders. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nInterests of Avalara\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 65.\nQ.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal?\nA.\nThe SEC rules require Avalara to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will or may be made to\nAvalara\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger.\n17\nTable of Contents\nApproval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is not required to complete the merger.\nQ.\nWho is soliciting my vote?\nA.\nThe Board is soliciting your proxy, and Avalara will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree has been retained to assist with the solicitation of\nproxies. Avalara will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $45,000 and will reimburse Innisfree for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these\nand related services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also\nbe distributed through brokers, banks, or other nominees to beneficial owners of shares of Avalara common stock, in which case these parties will\nbe reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or\nother electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Avalara\u2019s directors, officers, and employees.\nQ.\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA.\nCarefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including the attached annexes,\nincluding, but not limited to, the merger agreement along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain\nimportant information about, among other things, the merger and how it affects shareholders. Whether or not you expect to attend the virtual\nspecial meeting in person, please submit a proxy (or provide instructions to your bank, broker, or other nominee, as applicable) to vote your shares\nas promptly as possible to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the special meeting.\nQ.\nHow do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?\nA.\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent (American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC), you are considered a\n\u201cshareholder of record\u201d and you may:\n\u2022\nVote in person\u2014shareholders who virtually attend the special meeting may vote electronically at the special meeting, which will revoke any\nproxy previously submitted\u037e\n\u2022\nVote through the internet\u2014in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your enclosed proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nVote by telephone-in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your enclosed proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nVote by mail\u2014if you request or receive a paper proxy card by mail, simply complete, sign, and date the enclosed proxy card and promptly\nreturn it in the postage-paid envelope provided or, if the envelope is missing, please mail your completed proxy card to Avalara, Inc., c/o\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated, 20 Oser Avenue, Suite 100, Hauppauge, NY 11788. Your completed, signed, and dated proxy card must be\nreceived prior to the special meeting.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to submit a proxy to vote to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the\nmeeting and vote virtually if you have already submitted a proxy. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to\nvote by submitting a proxy over the internet or by telephone, which are convenient, cost-effective, and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy\ncard by mail. If you return your signed proxy card to us or vote by submitting your proxy over the internet or by telephone before the special\nmeeting, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, we will vote your shares as you direct in such proxy.\nIf you return an executed proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of Avalara common\nstock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal.\n18\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker, bank, or other nominee?\nA.\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you will\nreceive a voting instruction form from your broker, bank, or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. If\nyou are a beneficial owner of shares held by a broker, bank, or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the virtual special meeting, you\nmust obtain a legal proxy, in PDF or Image (gif, jpg, or png) file format, from the broker, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares issued in your\nname, authorizing you to vote in person at the virtual special meeting.\nQ.\nCan I change or revoke my proxy after it has been submitted?\nA.\nYes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you\nmay change or revoke your proxy by:\n\u2022\nsubmitting another proxy over the internet or by telephone for shares held directly\u037e\n\u2022\ntimely delivering a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Corporate Secretary\u037e\n\u2022\ntimely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy by mail\u037e or\n\u2022\nattending the special meeting and voting virtually. Simply attending the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.\nIf you are the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank, or other\nnominee to change or revoke your voting instructions provided to such broker, bank, or other nominee.\nQ.\nHow many shares of Avalara common stock must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?\nA.\nThe presence at the special meeting, in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy, of a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara\ncommon stock issued and outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum. There must be a\nquorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the shareholders holding a majority in\nvoting power of shares of Avalara common stock, present in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special\nmeeting, may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date, or time. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an\nadjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject Avalara to additional expense. As of the close of business on the record\ndate, there were 88,557,882 shares of Avalara common stock outstanding. Accordingly, 44,278,942 shares of Avalara common stock must be present\nor represented by proxy at the special meeting to constitute a quorum. If you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the\nInternet or by telephone, or submit a ballot virtually at the special meeting (regardless of whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your shares\nof Avalara common stock will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nQ.\nWhat if I abstain from voting on any proposal? What if I do not vote?\nA.\nFor the merger proposal, you may vote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST,\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN.\u201d Abstentions will not count as votes cast for or against the merger\nproposal, but will still count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is\nbased on the total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding on the record date. As a result, if you abstain, or if you fail to vote (or\nsubmit voting instructions to your bank, broker, or other nominee, in the case of \u201cstreet name\u201d shares), it will have the same effect as if you vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the merger agreement.\nFor the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal, you may vote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST,\u201d\nor \u201cABSTAIN.\u201d Each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires that\nthe number of votes cast\n19\nTable of Contents\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal. As a result, abstentions will not be considered a\nvote cast on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal and will have no effect on\nthe outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present). If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker,\nor other nominee on how to vote your shares of Avalara common stock will result in such shares not being counted for purposes of determining\nthe presence of a quorum and will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or\nthe adjournment proposal. Shareholders should note, however, that the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is\nadvisory in nature, and the results of that vote will not affect the compensation that would, or may, be payable to the named executive officer in\nconnection with the merger.\nQ.\nWill my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or over the internet or by telephone or in person at the virtual special meeting?\nA.\nIf you are a shareholder of record and you do not attend the special meeting or sign and return your proxy card, or vote by submitting your proxy\nover the internet or by telephone, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted as present for purposes of\ndetermining whether a quorum exists. The failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares at the special meeting will have no effect\non the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, the vote to\napprove the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record\ndate. As a result, if you fail to return your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nmerger proposal.\nQ.\nWhat is a broker non-vote? If I hold my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my shares for me on the proposals\nto be considered at the special meeting?\nA.\nBroker non-votes involve shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by brokers, banks, and other nominees that are present or represented by proxy at the\nspecial meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank, or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote\non a particular proposal and such broker, bank, or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Under NYSE rules, brokers,\nbanks, and other nominees holding shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals\ndescribed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, if a beneficial owner of shares of Avalara common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d does not give voting\ninstructions to the broker, bank, or other nominee with respect to at least one of the three proposals, then those shares will not be counted as\npresent in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy at the special meeting (including for purposes of determining a quorum). Because all\nthree proposals are non-discretionary matters, it is not expected that there will be any broker non-votes at the special meeting\u037e however, it is\npossible that a broker non-vote could occur with respect to one or more of the proposals to the extent that voting instructions are given to a broker,\nbank, or other nominee with respect to at least one but less than all of the proposals. Because the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on\nthe total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding on the record date, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank, or\nother nominee or if a broker non-vote occurs with respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger\nproposal. To the extent that you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee or a broker non-vote occurs with respect to\nthe named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of\nsuch proposals because it will not be considered a vote cast on such matters.\nQ.\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nA.\nNo. Because any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record,\nany shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes\n20\nTable of Contents\nwith shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust, or as\ncustodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different\nform of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an\nindividual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.\nQ.\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nA.\nIf your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction form.\nPlease complete and return all of the proxy cards or voting instruction forms you receive (or submit each of your proxies over the internet or by\ntelephone) to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\nQ.\nAm I entitled to exercise dissenters\u2019 rights under the WBCA instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares of Avalara\ncommon stock?\nA.\nYes. Holders of Company common stock are entitled to assert dissenters\u2019 rights in connection with the merger. For additional information, please\nsee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Dissenters\u2019 Rights\u201d beginning on page 74.\nQ.\nHow does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Avalara common stock prior to the last trading day prior to media reports\nspeculating on the proposed merger with Parent? How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Avalara common stock as of\na recent trading date?\nA.\nThe merger consideration of $93.50 per share represents a 27.1% premium over the closing price of $73.54 per share of Avalara common stock on\nJuly 6, 2022, the last trading day prior to media reports speculating on the proposed merger. On September 9, 2022, the last practicable day before\nthe printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of Avalara common stock on the NYSE was $91.99 per share. You are encouraged to obtain\ncurrent market quotations for Avalara common stock.\nQ.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Avalara common stock before the completion of the merger?\nA.\nIf you transfer your shares of Avalara common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger or to\ndemand dissenters\u2019 rights in connection with the merger. In order to receive the merger consideration or to exercise dissenters\u2019 rights in connection\nwith the merger, you must hold your shares of Avalara common stock through the effective time. The record date for shareholders entitled to vote\nat the special meeting is earlier than the date the merger is anticipated to be consummated. Accordingly, if you sell or transfer your shares of\nAvalara common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made\nbetween you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares, and each of you (the transferor and the transferee) notifies\nAvalara in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration, if the merger is consummated, to the\nperson to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Avalara common stock, but you will have retained your right to vote these shares at the special\nmeeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Avalara common stock after the record date, we encourage you to complete, date,\nsign, and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the Internet or by telephone.\nQ.\nWhat is a proxy?\nA.\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of Avalara common stock. The written document\ndescribing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special\n21\nTable of Contents\nmeeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Avalara common stock is called a \u201cproxy\ncard.\u201d The Board has designated Scott McFarlane, Avalara\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Alesia Pinney, Avalara\u2019s Executive Vice\nPresident, Chief Legal Officer, and Secretary, as proxies for the special meeting.\nQ.\nIf a shareholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA.\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way\nthat you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted\n\u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d or to abstain from voting on all, some, or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting. If you\nproperly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your\nproperly signed proxy will be voted (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory\nproposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nQ.\nWho will count the votes obtained at the special meeting?\nA.\nThe votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the special meeting.\nQ.\nWhen will Avalara announce the voting results of the special meeting, and where can I find the voting results?\nA.\nAvalara intends to announce the preliminary voting results at the special meeting and will report the final voting results of the special meeting in a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the special meeting. All reports that Avalara files with the SEC are\npublicly available when filed.\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have questions about the merger, require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares, or need additional copies of this proxy\nstatement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree, which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent for Avalara in connection with the\nmerger, or us.\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, New York 10022\nShareholders may call toll free: (877) 687-1873\nBanks and Brokers may call collect: (212) 750-5833\nor\nAvalara, Inc.\n255 South King Street, Suite 1800\nSeattle, Washington 98104\nAttention: Investor Relations\nTelephone: (206) 826-4900\nwww.avalara.com\nIf your broker, bank, or other nominee holds your shares, you should also call your broker, bank, or other nominee for additional information.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",

            "text": "THE SPECIAL MEETING\nThis proxy statement is being provided to Avalara shareholders as part of a solicitation by the Board of proxies for use at the special meeting to be held\nat the time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.\nDate, Time, and Place\nThe special meeting of Avalara shareholders (the \u201cspecial meeting\u201d) is scheduled to be held virtually on October 14, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The\nspecial meeting will be a virtual meeting of shareholders. Only holders of record of Avalara common stock of September 8, 2022, the record date for the\nspecial meeting, or their legal proxy holders may attend and participate in the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. You will be\nable to attend the special meeting by visiting www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm, where you will be able to listen to the special meeting, submit\nquestions, and vote. To participate in the special meeting, you must pre-register at www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time on\nThursday, October 13, 2022. You will not be able to attend the meeting in person.\nPurpose of the Special Meeting\nAt the special meeting, Avalara shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nthe merger proposal, which is further described in the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger,\u201d \u201cThe Merger Agreement,\u201d and \u201cMerger Proposal\n(Proposal 1)\u201d beginning on pages 32, 78, and 103, respectively\u037e\n\u2022\nthe named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, which approval shall be on a non-binding, advisory basis, as\nfurther discussed under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Avalara\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\u201d and \u201cAdvisory Vote on\nNamed executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal (Proposal 2)\u201d beginning on pages 65 and 104, respectively\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe adjournment proposal, as further described under \u201cAdjournment Proposal (Proposal 3)\u201d beginning on page 105.\nAvalara shareholders must approve the merger proposal as a condition to the completion of the merger. If Avalara shareholders fail to approve the merger\nproposal, the merger will not occur. The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is a vote separate and apart\nfrom the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named\nexecutive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related\ncompensation advisory proposal is only advisory in nature, it will not be binding on Avalara, Parent, Merger Sub, or the surviving corporation.\nAccordingly, because Avalara is contractually obligated to pay such merger-related compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the\nconditions applicable thereto, if the merger proposal is approved and the closing of the merger occurs, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.\nRecommendation of the Avalara Board of Directors\nThe Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Avalara and Avalara shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the\nmerger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger in accordance with the WBCA, (ii) adopted the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, in accordance with WBCA and (iii) adopted a resolution recommending the merger agreement be\napproved by Avalara shareholders. A description of factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and declare it\nadvisable to enter the merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub can be found in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 46.\n26Table of Contents\nThe Board unanimously recommends that Avalara shareholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the named executive officer merger-related\ncompensation advisory proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nThe merger proposal must be approved as a condition for the merger to occur. If Avalara shareholders fail to approve the merger proposal by the requisite\nvote, the merger will not occur.\nRecord Date\u037e Shareholders Entitled to Vote\nOnly holders of Avalara common stock at the close of business on September 8, 2022, the record date for the special meeting (the \u201crecord date\u201d), will be\nentitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. A list of shareholders entitled to\nvote at the special meeting will be available at the virtual special meeting website during the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date,\n88,557,882 shares of Avalara common stock were issued and outstanding.\nHolders of Avalara common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Avalara common stock they own at the close of business on the record date.\nShareholder List\nFor at least 10 days prior to the special meeting, a complete list of shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for examination by\nany shareholder, for any purpose germane to the special meeting, during ordinary business hours at our principal office at 255 South King Street, Suite\n1800, Seattle, Washington 98104. If you would like to view the shareholder list, please contact our Investor Relations department in advance at\ninvestor@avalara.com. The list will be available during the entire time of the special meeting.\nQuorum\nThe presence at the special meeting, in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of\nAvalara common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote at the meeting will constitute a quorum.\nShareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting may participate in the meeting by remote communication. To participate in the special meeting, you\nmust pre-register at www.cesonlineservices.com/avlr22_vm by 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time on Thursday, October 13, 2022. Actual attendance at the virtual\nspecial meeting is not required in order to be counted for purposes of determining a quorum if voting by proxy. There must be a quorum for business to\nbe conducted at the special meeting. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the shareholders holding a majority in voting power of shares of\nAvalara common stock, present in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, may adjourn the special\nmeeting to another place, date, or time. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of\nthe special meeting and may subject Avalara to additional expense.\nIf you submit a properly executed proxy card or submit your proxy over the internet or by telephone, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be\ncounted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to\ninstruct your bank, broker, or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Avalara common stock will result in such shares not being counted for\npurposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nRequired Vote\nThe approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares of Avalara common stock\nissued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote thereon.\n27\nTable of Contents\nApproval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires that the number\nof votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal.\nAbstentions\nAn abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy, but abstains from voting by\nmarking \u201cABSTAIN\u201d on such holder\u2019s ballot or proxy.\nAbstentions will not count as votes cast for or against the merger proposal, but will still count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is\npresent. However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of Avalara common stock outstanding on the record\ndate. As a result, if you abstain, it will have the same effect as if you vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the merger agreement.\nEach of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal requires for its approval that the\nnumber of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal. As a result, abstentions will not\nbe considered a vote cast on the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal and the adjournment proposal and will\ntherefore have no effect on the outcome of such proposals (assuming a quorum is present).\nIf no instruction as to how to vote is given (including no instruction to abstain from voting) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the\nproxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d (i) approval of the merger proposal, (ii) approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory\nproposal, and (iii) approval of the adjournment proposal.\nFailure to Vote and Broker Non-Votes\nThe proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Avalara common\nstock entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, the failure to vote or the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nproposal to approve the merger agreement.\nThe approval of the named executive officer related compensation advisory proposal requires that the number of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal at the\nspecial meeting exceeds the number of votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal. Consequently, the abstention from voting will not be considered a vote cast on\nthe proposal and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the compensation advisory proposal (assuming a quorum is present).\nThe proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires that the number of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal at\nthe special meeting exceeds the number of votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal. Consequently, the abstention from voting will not be considered a vote cast\non the proposal and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special\nmeeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present at the virtual special meeting or represented by proxy at the special\nmeeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, date, or time. In such case, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe proposal.\nUnder applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the\nspecial meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust, or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker,\ntrust, or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares\non a particular proposal, but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if your shares are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d\nyour bank, broker, trust, or other nominee will NOT be\n28\nTable of Contents\nable to vote your shares of Avalara common stock on any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted as present in determining the presence of\na quorum, unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee on how to vote. Because the proposal to approve the merger\nagreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Avalara common stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust, or\nother nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Because the\napproval of each of (i) the named executive officer merger related compensation advisory proposal, and (ii) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting\nfrom time to time if necessary or appropriate requires that the number of votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal at the special meeting exceeds the number of\nvotes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal,\nthe failure to provide your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of each such proposal.\nVoting by Avalara\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nAt the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of Avalara and their affiliates were entitled to vote 1,421,237 shares of\nAvalara common stock, or approximately 1.6% of the shares of Avalara common stock issued and outstanding on that date. Avalara\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers have informed us that they intend to vote their shares in favor of the merger proposal and the other proposals to be considered at the\nspecial meeting, although none of Avalara\u2019s directors and executive officers is obligated to do so.\nAttendance and Voting at the Special Meeting\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent (American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC), you are considered a\n\u201cshareholder of record.\u201d If you are a shareholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote your shares or have your shares voted at the\nspecial meeting. You may attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person at the virtual special meeting, or you may cause your shares to be\nvoted by authorizing the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares at the special meeting by returning the executed proxy card by\nmail or by voting through the internet or by telephone. If you choose to submit a proxy to vote your shares over the internet or by telephone, there is no\nneed for you to mail back your proxy card.

As a\nbeneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. Proxy materials, including a voting\ninstruction form, should be forwarded to you by that organization.

Innisfree has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies.\nAvalara will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $45,000 and will reimburse Innisfree for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and related\nservices in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail.

Avalara selected\nGoldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed transaction based on Goldman Sachs\u2019s experience in transactions similar to\nthe proposed transaction, qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of Avalara and its business and the industries in which Avalara\nconducts its business. Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and other transactions, as well as for corporate initiatives\nand other purposes.\n33Table of Contents\nOn January 25 and 26, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management. In addition\nto other ordinary course matters, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management reviewed with the Board Avalara\u2019s financial performance in fiscal year 2021, a\nbudget and forecast for fiscal year 2022, opportunities and challenges for Avalara\u2019s foreign operations centered in Europe, including challenges as a\nresult of Avalara relying on a limited number of partners, including a large European marketplace partner we refer to as Partner A, and having only\nrecently started to provide e-invoicing services in Europe in 2021, which services Avalara\u2019s senior management believed needed to be expanded in order\nto compete internationally against other companies in the industries in, or adjacent to, which Avalara operates, some of which had significantly more\nadvanced e-invoicing services. Members of Avalara\u2019s senior management also reviewed with the Board potential acquisitions, including the potential\nacquisition of a foreign company that is referred to herein as Company A that has a developed e-invoicing business, which had been previously\ndiscussed with the Board and had been under review by Avalara\u2019s senior management since late 2021, during which time members of Company A\u2019s senior\nmanagement had repeatedly informed Avalara\u2019s senior management that Company A was not interested in a potential transaction, including because\nCompany A did not expect that Avalara would be able to offer a sufficiently high valuation that would be of interest to Company A\u2019s board of directors.\nMembers of Avalara\u2019s senior management presented their views to the Board that, given the need to quickly develop Avalara\u2019s e-invoicing capabilities,\nwhich was a significant aspect of Avalara\u2019s international strategy, Company A was a priority for a potential acquisition.\nIn March and April 2022, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management received separate calls from representatives of private equity firms referred to herein\nas Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D. On these calls, the representatives of the private equity firms separately expressed their interest in Avalara, their\ndesire to learn more about Avalara\u2019s business and their willingness to participate in potential strategic alternatives ranging in various cases from a\nminority investment, including in connection with potential acquisitions of other companies in, or adjacent to, the industries in which Avalara operates, to\nan acquisition of Avalara. None of these calls included any discussion of the financial or other terms of a potential transaction involving Avalara.\nAlso in April 2022, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management provided the Board with an email update regarding a potential acquisition of Company A.\nAs previously discussed with the Board, including at its January 25 and 26, 2022 meeting, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management believed that\nacquiring Company A would be an important part of expanding and accelerating Avalara\u2019s e-invoicing business, which would be a significant aspect of\nAvalara\u2019s international strategy to help achieve Avalara\u2019s overall strategic plan. Since the Board\u2019s January 25 and 26, 2022 meeting, Partner A had decided\nto again seek to modify the pricing terms under its commercial relationship with Avalara and decrease the price that would be paid for Avalara\u2019s services,\nwhich, if accepted by Avalara, was expected to reduce Avalara\u2019s revenue and margins in Europe. As a result, Avalara\u2019s senior management had begun to\nreevaluate its business relationship with Partner A and had expressed their views to the Board that advancing Avalara\u2019s international strategy had\nbecome even more important.\nOn April 18, 2022, Avalara submitted an indication of interest to acquire Company A. On April 22, 2022, by unanimous written consent, the Board\nauthorized the engagement of Goldman Sachs to act as a financial advisor with respect the potential acquisition of Company A. As the acquisition of\nCompany A would be the largest transaction undertaken by Avalara since its formation, Avalara\u2019s senior management asked that Goldman Sachs provide\nthe Board with a presentation on Avalara\u2019s historical financial performance, current market conditions, the expectations of public equity analysts of\nAvalara\u2019s future performance, the potential effect of an acquisition of Company A on Avalara\u2019s financial performance and other strategic alternatives,\nincluding the potential acquisition of other companies in the industries in, or adjacent to, which Avalara operates, one of which we refer to herein as\nCompany B and another of which we refer to herein as Company C, or a potential sale of Avalara. Following Avalara\u2019s submission of an indication of\ninterest to acquire Company A, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management continued to contact members of Company A\u2019s senior management and the\nchairman of Company A\u2019s board of directors to express interest in a potential transaction.\nOn April 26 and 27, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and, for a\nportion of such meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs in\n34\nTable of Contents\nattendance. In addition to other ordinary course matters, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management reviewed with the Board Avalara\u2019s performance in the\nfirst quarter of 2022 and discussed certain challenges that were affecting Avalara\u2019s business and operations, including a reduction in the growth of new\nbookings as a result of weakness in Avalara\u2019s international business and the reduction in revenue attributable to Partner A due to lower volumes and an\nexpected decrease in contract pricing, which was expected to be reduced further, and, in light of the lower associated profit margins, members of Avalara\u2019s\nsenior management were contemplating potentially winding down Avalara\u2019s relationship with Partner A. Other challenges included slower than expected\ngrowth in both new bookings and upsell bookings as a result of sales and marketing capacity issues and other operational challenges, including weak\ngrowth in marketing demand generation and other operational weaknesses that could affect Avalara\u2019s remaining fiscal year 2022 performance. Members of\nAvalara\u2019s senior management also reviewed with the Board an updated long-term forecast for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 and discussed the\nopportunities and challenges in achieving the long-term forecast, as well as the potential acquisitions of Company A, Company B and Company C.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the historical financial performance of Avalara, current market conditions, the expectations of\npublic equity analysts of Avalara\u2019s future performance, the potential effect of an acquisition of Company A on Avalara\u2019s financial performance, including\nthe potential negative impact on Avalara\u2019s market value given the proposed valuation in its indication of interest, and other strategic alternatives,\nincluding the potential acquisition of Company B or Company C or a potential sale of Avalara. With respect to a potential sale of Avalara, representatives\nof Goldman Sachs provided the Board their views as to the potential bidders that would likely have both the interest and financial capability to engage in\na potential acquisition of Avalara, as well as the risks and benefits of reaching out to multiple potential bidders. Representatives of Goldman Sachs\nhighlighted both financial investors, with an emphasis on financial investors with a history of engaging in large transactions in the software and\ntechnology industries (including Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D), as well as strategic buyers, noting potential interest, financial capability and\npotential impediments or challenges associated with such parties pursuing a potential acquisition of Avalara. With respect to the potential strategic\nbuyers highlighted by Goldman Sachs, many of which were current partners of Avalara, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management believed that those\npotential strategic buyers would not be interested in acquiring Avalara because Avalara\u2019s strategy is centered around being platform-agnostic and\ninvolves integrating Avalara\u2019s products and services into the platforms of many different partners who compete with others, such that a potential\nacquisition of Avalara by a strategic buyer could result in a significant loss of customers because other partners could cease to integrate Avalara\u2019s\nproducts and services into their respective platforms. Additionally, members of Avalara\u2019s management had not been contacted by any strategic parties\nregarding a potential acquisition of Avalara since outreach from a single strategic party at the time of Avalara\u2019s initial public offering in 2018.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs expressed their views that, if the Board were to explore a potential sale, that it would be beneficial to commence\ndiscussions with financial investors with a history of engaging in large transactions in the software and technology industries, including Party A, Party\nB, Party C, Party D, another private equity firm referred to herein as Party E and Vista, given their higher likelihood of interest and ability to obtain the\nfinancing that would be necessary to acquire Avalara. Following discussion, including of the operational and market challenges facing Avalara\u2019s\nbusiness, the declining revenue in Avalara\u2019s international businesses and challenges in competing in Europe against other companies with more\nadvanced products, the potential negative impacts on Avalara\u2019s valuation if it were to pursue an acquisition of Company A or another company that\nwould likely be necessary for Avalara to execute on its strategic plan and the deterioration of market conditions resulting in lower valuation multiples\nacross the industries in which Avalara operates, the Board directed members of Avalara\u2019s senior management, together with representatives of Goldman\nSachs, to begin exploring a potential sale with a targeted group of financial investors with a history of engaging in large transactions in the software and\ntechnology industries to help the Board better assess Avalara\u2019s valuation in a potential sale transaction and, therefore, the relative desirability of that\nparticular strategic alternative.\nOver the course of the following weeks, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management worked with representatives of Goldman Sachs to prepare for the\npotential sale process as directed by the Board and provided the Board with email updates on, among other topics, discussions with Company A and the\nstatus of the potential sale process. During this time, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management also reviewed with a majority of the\n35\nTable of Contents\nmembers of the Board the terms of a potential engagement of Goldman Sachs to act as financial advisor with respect to the potential sale process, all of\nwhom were supportive of such engagement. In addition, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management prepared certain forecasts for fiscal years 2022\nthrough 2025, which we refer to as the \u201cMay Projections\u201d (discussed further in the section entitled \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d beginning on page 62 of this\nproxy statement), that were the same as the forecasts reviewed with the Board at its April 26 and 27, 2022 meeting except for an increase in the projected\nfree cash flow.\nOn May 3, 2022, representatives of Party E contacted members of Avalara\u2019s senior management to express their interest in Avalara, their desire to learn\nmore about Avalara\u2019s business and their willingness to participate in potential strategic alternatives.\nOn May 13, 2022, a representative of Vista contacted a member of Avalara\u2019s board of directors to express its interest in Avalara and its desire to learn more\nabout Avalara\u2019s business.\nOn May 19, 2022, on behalf of Avalara and consistent with the Board\u2019s directives to explore a potential sale through an organized competitive process\nwith a targeted group of financial investors, representatives of Goldman Sachs began outreach to seven parties\u2014Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party\nE, Vista and an additional private equity firm referred to as Party F. Over the course of the potential sale process, over 10 parties were either contacted by\nAvalara or had reached out to Avalara regarding a potential transaction involving Avalara.\nAvalara or had reached out to Avalara regarding a potential transaction involving Avalara.\nOn May 20, 2022, Avalara formally engaged Goldman Sachs to act as financial advisor with respect to the potential sale process.\nOn May 26, 2022, by unanimous written consent, the Board approved the May Projections for use in the potential sale process. Thereafter, the May\nProjections were provided to the parties participating in the potential sale process as part of their due diligence and to Goldman Sachs for use in their\nfinancial analyses.\nOn May 29, 2022, representatives of Party G, a private equity firm and the majority owner of Company B, contacted a member of Avalara\u2019s senior\nmanagement to express their interest in a potential transaction, including a potential acquisition of Avalara or a potential merger with Company B.\nFollowing discussions between Avalara senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Avalara\u2019s senior management determined it was in the\nbest interests of Avalara, and consistent with the directions of the Board, to engage in further discussions with Party G to explore their interest in a\npotential transaction and potentially permit Party G to participate in the potential sale process.\nOver the course of the end of May and the first week of June, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party E, Vista and Party G entered into confidentiality\nagreements with Avalara. The confidentiality agreements included a prohibition on the counterparty contacting debt or equity financing sources without\nAvalara\u2019s prior approval, as well as a standstill provision, which did not prohibit the counterparty from making private acquisition proposals to Avalara.\nAs Party B had already engaged in discussions with an institutional co-investor regarding a potential acquisition of Avalara prior to being contacted by\nGoldman Sachs, Party B requested consent from Avalara to contact such institutional co-investor as a potential financing source in connection with the\npotential sale process. Following discussions between Avalara senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Avalara\u2019s senior management\ndetermined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent with the directions of the Board, to permit Party B to contact such institutional co-\ninvestor as a potential financing source. Party F informed Goldman Sachs that it did not wish to participate in the potential sale process and did not\nexecute a confidentiality agreement.\nBeginning in the end of May, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management held management presentations with the parties that had executed a\nconfidentiality agreement. From the end of May until the execution of the merger agreement on August 8, 2022 (or, if earlier, the date on which a party\nengaged in the potential sale process ceased to pursue a potential transaction), each of the parties conducted due diligence that variously included\naccess to a virtual data room (except in the case of Party G, which was still separately considering\n36\nTable of Contents\nwhether to explore a potential transaction), review of additional documentary materials, virtual and in-person diligence sessions and other customary due\ndiligence.\nOn May 30, 2022, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management met representatives of Party B for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,\nAvalara\u2019s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.\nOn May 31, 2022, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management met representatives of Vista for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,\nAvalara\u2019s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.\nOn June 1, 2022, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management met representatives of Party A for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,\nAvalara\u2019s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.\nOn June 2, 2022, Vista contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara\u2019s consent to contact six institutional co-investors to serve as potential equity\nfinancing sources in addition to several potential debt financing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Vista that it would discuss the\nrequest with Avalara.\nOn June 6, 2022, a representative of a private equity firm who had not been contacted in the potential sale process contacted members of Avalara\u2019s senior\nmanagement to express interest in participating as an investor in a strategic combination involving Avalara and Company C. During the course of this\ndiscussion, the representative of the private equity firm did not state that it had any knowledge of whether Company C would be interested in engaging\nin a transaction with Avalara and did not express an interest in leading an acquisition of Avalara.\nOn June 7, 2022, Party C contacted Goldman Sachs to express its interest in partnering with additional private equity firms in connection with leading an\nacquisition of Avalara, as well as to seek Avalara\u2019s consent to contact certain institutional co-investors as equity financing sources. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs informed Party C that it would discuss the request with Avalara.\nOn June 8, 2022, Party E contacted Goldman Sachs to express its interest in partnering with another private equity firm involved in the potential sale\nprocess in connection with leading an acquisition of Avalara. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party E that it would discuss the request with\nAvalara.\nOn June 8, 2022, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management met representatives of Vista for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things,\nAvalara\u2019s performance and strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.\nOn June 9, 2022, Party E contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara\u2019s consent to contact six institutional co-investors to serve as potential equity\nfinancing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party E that it would discuss the request with Avalara.\nOn June 10, 2022, Party A contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara\u2019s consent to contact one institutional co-investor to serve as a potential equity\nfinancing source and six financial institutions to serve as potential debt financing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party A that it\nwould discuss the request with Avalara.\nLater on June 10, 2022, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs updated members of the Board on the potential\nsale process by videoconference. Following this update and subsequent discussions between members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management determined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent with the\ndirections of the Board, to permit Vista to contact three institutional co-investors who had not also been requested by any other party to serve as\npotential equity financing sources. Members of Avalara\u2019s senior management determined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent with the\ndirections of the\n37\nTable of Contents\nBoard, to not permit Vista and other parties to contact institutional co-investors that had also been requested by at least one other party so that, in the\nevent the potential sale process were to proceed, those other institutional co-investors could be assigned among the parties that remained in the process\nin order for all parties to have sufficient access to financing sources. Members of Avalara\u2019s senior management also determined it was in the best\ninterests of Avalara, and consistent with the directions of the Board, not to permit any party to partner with any other party or to contact potential debt\nfinancing sources at the current time.\nOn June 13, 2022, Party C contacted Goldman Sachs to request Avalara\u2019s consent to contact three institutional co-investors to serve as potential equity\nfinancing sources and four financial institutions to serve as potential debt financing sources. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party C that it\nwould discuss the request with Avalara.\nAlso on June 13, 2022, Party D informed Goldman Sachs that they were no longer interested in a potential acquisition of Avalara and would cease to\nparticipate in the potential sale process because of the potential size of the transaction, the timing of the sale process and their assessment of the\nvaluation that a transaction would likely require.\nAlso on June 13, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs sent a letter to each of Party A, Party B, Party C, Party E and Vista setting\nforth in greater detail the procedures for the potential sale process and asking for initial indications of interest to be submitted by June 22, 2022.\nOn June 17, 2022, Party B contacted Goldman Sachs to express its interest in partnering with one or more private equity firms in connection with leading\nan acquisition of Avalara. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Party B that it would discuss the request with Avalara.\nAlso on June 17, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and representatives of\nGoldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (\u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d), Avalara\u2019s outside counsel, in attendance. Before the representatives of\nGoldman Sachs joined the meeting, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management reviewed with the Board an extrapolation of the May Projections for fiscal\nyears 2026 through 2042 that had been prepared by Avalara\u2019s senior management for use by Goldman Sachs in their financial analyses. Following\ndiscussion, the Board approved the extrapolation of the May Projections for use by Goldman Sachs in their financial analyses. A member of Avalara\u2019s\nsenior management also reviewed with the Board the engagement letter with Goldman Sachs that had been previously reviewed by a majority of the\ndirectors and entered into by Avalara, which the Board ratified at this meeting. Following such discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs joined the\nmeeting. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed and discussed with the Board its fiduciary duties, including those in connection with a potential\nsale of Avalara. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on the potential sale process, including an inquiry from a representative of a\nprivate equity firm regarding a rumor of a potential transaction process involving Avalara, in respect of which the representatives of Goldman Sachs\nexpressed their views that the private equity firm did not have a serious interest in Avalara given the nature of the outreach and that they had not made\nany further inquiries, and a request by Vista to potentially review the proposed form of merger agreement for any transaction in advance of submitting\ninitial indications of interest. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the Board a draft merger agreement that contemplated, among other\nthings, a \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory efforts standard requiring an acquiror to take all actions to obtain all necessary regulatory approval, a \u201cgo-shop\u201d\nprovision permitting Avalara to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, the ability of Avalara to terminate the merger\nagreement to accept a superior proposal, a company termination fee equal to 2.0% of transaction equity value (or, with respect to a proposal received from\na party that made an alternative proposal during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, 1.0% of transaction equity value) and a reverse termination fee equal to 8.0% of\ntransaction equity value. Following discussion, the Board directed members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and Goldman Sachs to provide the draft\nmerger agreement to the parties participating in the potential sale process. Thereafter, the draft merger agreement was made available in the virtual data\nroom to Party A, Party B, Party C, Party E and Vista. The draft merger agreement was not made available to Party G as they were still separately\nconsidering whether to explore a potential transaction.\n38\nTable of Contents\nOn June 20, 2022, Scott McFarlane, Avalara\u2019s chief executive officer and a director of Avalara, spoke with the chairman of the board of directors of\nCompany A who informed Mr. McFarlane that Company A was unlikely to proceed with a transaction at the price proposed by Avalara in its April 18,\n2022 indication of interest and that Company A\u2019s management team sought to continue as an independent company. In light of this feedback, members of\nAvalara\u2019s senior management ceased to actively pursue a potential transaction with Company A and informed the Board of this development in\nconnection with its June 24, 2022 meeting.\nOn June 21, 2022, Party G informed Goldman Sachs that they had determined not to explore a potential transaction involving Avalara because of\nchallenging market conditions and the difficulty of achieving significant synergies in a potential combination with Company B.\nLater on June 21, 2022, Mr. McFarlane met representatives of Vista for dinner, during which they discussed, among other things, Avalara\u2019s performance\nand strategic plan and trends in the industries in which Avalara operates.\nOn June 22, 2022, Party C informed members of Avalara\u2019s senior management that they would not submit an indication of interest because of market\nconditions as well as concerns around Avalara\u2019s operating plan. Separately, Party E informed Goldman Sachs that they would not submit an indication of\ninterest because they did not believe that their valuation would be attractive to the Board. Separately, Party B informed Goldman Sachs that they would\nneed more time to determine whether to submit an indication of interest. Party B ultimately did not submit an indication of interest at any point during the\npotential sale process.\nOn June 23, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs received indications of interest from Party A and Vista to acquire Avalara in an\nall-cash transaction. The indications of interest, each of which was preliminary in nature and made subject to further due diligence, were as follows: Party\nA valued Avalara between $90.00 and $95.00 per share of Avalara common stock, and Vista valued Avalara between $97.00 and $101.00 per share of\nAvalara common stock. In connection with their indications of interest, both Party A and Vista requested to contact additional debt financing sources and\ninstitutional co-investors.\nOn June 24, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. In connection with the meeting, a representative of Avalara\u2019s senior management furnished to the Board a\ndisclosure statement provided by Goldman Sachs that identified prior or current engagements or relationships between Goldman Sachs and each of Party\nA and Vista and certain of their respective affiliates and portfolio companies. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed the disclosure\nstatement with the Board. The relationships with Vista and its affiliates and portfolio companies are discussed in greater detail in the section entitled\n\u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed with the Board\nits participation in Avalara\u2019s capped call transaction that had been entered into in connection with its issuance of convertible notes and the potential\neffects of a sale of Avalara on such transaction as further described in the section entitled \u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d beginning on page 53\nof this proxy statement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the indications of interest received from Party A and Vista and its\npreliminary financial analyses based on the May Projections (including the extrapolations through 2042) and discussed relevant considerations for the\nBoard in determining whether to continue with the potential sale process and whether to contact additional potential financial or strategic parties to\nparticipate in the potential sale process. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and members of Avalara\u2019s senior management expressed their views that,\nbecause Avalara\u2019s strategy is centered around being platform-agnostic and involves integrating Avalara\u2019s products and services into the platforms of\nmany different partners who compete with others, such that a potential acquisition of Avalara by a strategic buyer could potentially result in a significant\nloss of customers because partners could cease to integrate Avalara\u2019s products and services into their respective platforms, they did not expect that\ncontacting additional potential strategic or financial parties would result in additional proposals with a value in excess of the price that could be achieved\nfrom Party A or Vista. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also highlighted certain transaction risks associated with contacting additional\n39\nTable of Contents\nparties and discussed other potential strategic alternatives available to Avalara. Following discussion, including of Avalara\u2019s prospects as a standalone\ncompany, the challenges that could prevent Avalara from achieving its strategic plan and the need to engage in a strategic acquisition that could\nnegatively impact Avalara\u2019s market value, the Board supported continuing the potential sale process without contacting additional parties, including\npermitting the parties to contact additional debt financing sources and institutional co-investors, and directed Goldman Sachs to solicit revised proposals\nfrom the current bidders.\nFollowing the meeting, at various points during the potential sale process in response to additional requests from Party A and Vista to contact additional\ndebt financing sources and institutional co-investors, Avalara\u2019s senior management determined it was in the best interests of Avalara, and consistent\nwith the directions of the Board, to permit Party A and Vista to contact certain debt financing sources and institutional co-investors.\nOn July 5, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs sent a letter to each of Party A and Vista setting forth in greater detail the\nprocedures for the next round of the potential sale process and asking for definitive proposals, together with markups of the draft merger agreement, to be\nsubmitted by July 14, 2022.\nOn July 6 and 7, 2022, representatives of Vista met with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management to conduct due diligence, which included dinner on the\nevening of July 6, 2022. Among other topics, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management discussed a summary of Avalara\u2019s performance in the second\nquarter of 2022, which was below management\u2019s expectations for revenue, representing the first quarter since Avalara\u2019s initial public offering where\nAvalara would not beat public market analysts\u2019 expectations on revenue, except for its earnings guidance released in May 2020 as a result of uncertainty\naround the COVID-19 pandemic, and increase its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such performance on Avalara\u2019s expected performance\nfor the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year.\nOn July 7, 2022, various media reports speculated that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition. The price per share of\nAvalara common stock as of the close of trading on July 6, 2022, the last trading day prior to such speculation, was $73.54, and the price per share of\nAvalara common stock as of the close of trading on July 7, 2022, the day such speculation began, was $85.63. Following the release of these reports,\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs received inquiries of varying degrees of seriousness from a variety of parties that were reviewed with members of\nAvalara\u2019s senior management and with the Board at the applicable meeting following receipt of each such inquiry.\nLater on July 7, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management in attendance. Members of\nAvalara\u2019s senior management reviewed with the Board the media reports speculating that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential\ntransaction. Members of Avalara\u2019s senior management then discussed with the Board Avalara\u2019s second quarter performance and a preliminary update to\nthe forecast for the 2022 fiscal year included in the May Projections to take into account Avalara\u2019s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the\neffect of such performance on Avalara\u2019s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year, including a reduction in the growth of new and\nupsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and sales capacity issues, which reduction was expected to increase in the remainder of fiscal year\n2022, high attrition in Avalara\u2019s sales and marketing departments, anticipated diminishing revenue from its relationship with Partner A and additional\nchallenges in Avalara\u2019s business. Members of Avalara\u2019s senior management also reviewed with the Board recent challenges and opportunities in\nAvalara\u2019s strategic plan, the potential effects on the Company\u2019s market value as a result of continuing to execute on the Company\u2019s strategic plan,\npotential strategic acquisitions and the status of the potential sale process.\nOn July 8, 2022, representatives of Party A met with Avalara to conduct due diligence. Among other topics, members of Avalara\u2019s senior management\ndiscussed a summary of Avalara\u2019s performance in the second quarter of 2022, which was below management\u2019s expectations for revenue, representing the\nfirst quarter since Avalara\u2019s initial public offering where Avalara would not beat public market analysts\u2019 expectations on revenue and, except for its\nearnings guidance released in May 2020 as a result of uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic,\n40\nTable of Contents\nincrease its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such performance on Avalara\u2019s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year.\nOn July 10, 2022, Avalara made additional details of Avalara\u2019s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the effect of such performance on Avalara\u2019s\nexpected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year available to both Vista and Party A in the virtual dataroom.\nOn July 12, 2022, Party A informed Goldman Sachs that they would not submit a definitive proposal because Avalara\u2019s second quarter results were below\nmanagement\u2019s expectations for revenue, their belief that Avalara\u2019s results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year would also be below expectations,\ngeneral macroeconomic conditions were uncertain and unfavorable, and a definitive proposal would likely include a price that would be substantially\nbelow their previous indication of interest, which Party A did not expect to be of interest to the Board.\nOn July 15, 2022, having not received a definitive proposal from Vista by the requested deadline of July 14, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs\ncontacted Vista to confirm whether Vista was still interested in participating in the potential sale process. In discussions with Goldman Sachs, Vista\ninformed Goldman Sachs that, while they were still interested in participating in the potential sale process, they required more time before being able to\nsubmit a definitive proposal in light of Avalara\u2019s second quarter results being below management\u2019s expectations for revenue, their belief that Avalara\u2019s\nresults for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year would also be below expectations, the deterioration in the financial markets and their need to contact\nadditional financing sources and continue discussions with existing financing sources to obtain the financing that would be necessary to acquire\nAvalara. Vista also indicated that any definitive proposal would likely include a price that would be below their previous indication of interest.\nOn July 16, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs noted that, since the media reports on July 7, 2022 speculating that\nAvalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition, several additional private equity firms had contacted them to express interest in\npotentially participating in a transaction involving Avalara, including as a potential source of financing, but not necessarily in leading an independent\nacquisition of Avalara, and none of these private equity firms submitted any oral or written indication of interest following such contacts.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Board the feedback received from Party A as to why it did not make a definitive proposal and\ntheir discussions with Vista as to why it had not submitted a definitive proposal by the requested deadline of July 14, 2022. Following discussion among\nthe Board, including Avalara\u2019s prospects as a standalone company and Avalara\u2019s options to continue the potential sale process, the Board decided to\nterminate the potential sale process.\nOn July 17, 2022, consistent with the Board\u2019s determination to terminate the potential sale process, Vista\u2019s access to the virtual data room was withdrawn.\nOn July 18, 2022, representatives of Vista spoke with representatives of Goldman Sachs about their access to the virtual data room being withdrawn.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs informed the representatives of Vista that, since Vista had not submitted a definitive proposal by the requested\ndeadline of July 14, 2022, the Board had decided not to continue the potential sale process with Vista, and Vista\u2019s access to the virtual data room had been\nwithdrawn.\nOn July 18, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management to address ordinary\ncourse matters that included the review of an updated version of the May Projections, which we refer to as the \u201cJuly Projections\u201d (discussed further in\nthe section entitled \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement). The July Projections updated the May Projections to take into\naccount Avalara\u2019s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the effect of such\n41\nTable of Contents\nperformance on Avalara\u2019s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year and the remainder of the forecast period, including a reduction in\nthe growth of new and upsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and sales capacity issues, which reduction was expected to increase in the\nremainder of fiscal year 2022, high attrition in Avalara\u2019s sales and marketing departments, the expected further reduction, and likely eventual elimination,\nin revenue from its relationship with Partner A and additional challenges in Avalara\u2019s business. Members of Avalara\u2019s senior management also discussed\nwith the Board the likely need to revise Avalara\u2019s public guidance, including a reduction in expected revenue and, by a smaller amount, an increase in\nnon-GAAP operating income, as a result of Avalara\u2019s performance in the second quarter of 2022 and the effect of such performance on Avalara\u2019s expected\nperformance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year.\nOn July 19, 2022, Vista submitted to Goldman Sachs an unsolicited revised indication of interest to acquire Avalara in an all-cash transaction that valued\nAvalara at $91.00 per share and requested additional diligence information and the ability to contact certain additional debt financing sources and\ninstitutional co-investors.\nLater on July 19, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of Vista and reiterated that the Board had decided not to continue\nthe potential sale process with Vista and noted that Vista\u2019s revised indication of interest was significantly lower than its initial indication of interest and\nthat it was unlikely to be of interest to the Board. The representatives of Goldman Sachs asked the representatives of Vista about aspects of their revised\nindication of interest, including Vista\u2019s ability to propose a higher valuation. The representatives of Vista stated that their ability to obtain financing\nwould affect their valuation.\nOn July 20, 2022, following discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs, Mr. McFarlane spoke with a representative of Vista and reiterated that the\nBoard had decided not to continue the potential sale process with Vista and noted that Vista\u2019s revised indication of interest was significantly lower than\nits initial indication of interest and that he believed it was unlikely to be of interest to the Board. Mr. McFarlane suggested that a valuation greater than or\nequal to the range originally proposed by Vista in its June 23, 2022 indication of interest would be more likely to be of interest to the Board. The\nrepresentative of Vista did not state whether Vista would be able to propose a greater valuation.\nLater on July 20, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of Vista. The representatives of Vista noted that, while Avalara\u2019s\nsecond quarter results were below management\u2019s expectations for revenue and Vista believed that Avalara\u2019s results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal\nyear would also be below expectations, Vista could potentially offer an increased price but that it would need to complete its diligence and to contact\nadditional financing sources to obtain the financing that would be necessary to acquire Avalara, particularly given that the financial markets had\ncontinued to deteriorate.\nOn July 21, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed the revised indication of interest received from Vista. Following\ndiscussion of whether to respond to Vista and potential responses, the Board agreed to permit Vista to contact additional debt financing sources and\ninstitutional co-investors and directed Goldman Sachs to inform Vista that, while the Board would have been willing to consider a transaction based on\nthe valuation proposed in Vista\u2019s original indication of interest, the Board was unlikely to consider a transaction at the valuation proposed in Vista\u2019s\nrevised indication of interest and that Vista would need to meaningfully increase its proposed valuation in order for the Board to consider a transaction.\nThe Board also directed management and Simpson Thacher to advance the merger agreement with Vista and its counsel to determine the existence of any\nother potential material issues.\nOn July 21, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Vista to ask that a revised indication of interest be\nsubmitted by August 1, 2022. The representatives of Vista responded that they would seek to submit a revised indication of interest but did not commit to\nsubmitting such indication by August 1, 2022.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOn July 22, 2022, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland & Ellis\u201d), outside counsel to Vista, sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Simpson Thacher that\ncontemplated, among other things, that Avalara would be subject to a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision where it would not be able to solicit alternative proposals\nfollowing the execution of the merger agreement, a company termination fee equal to 3.75% of transaction equity value and a reverse termination fee equal\nto 4.25% of transaction equity value.\nOn July 27, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Vista to ask when Vista expected to submit a\nrevised indication of interest. The representatives of Vista responded that they would seek to submit a revised indication of interest by August 4, 2022 or\nearlier.\nOn July 28, 2022, by unanimous written consent, the Board approved the July Projections that had been reviewed with the Board at its regularly\nscheduled meeting on July 18, 2022, together with an extrapolation of the July Projections for fiscal years 2026 through 2042 that had been prepared by\nAvalara\u2019s senior management for use by Goldman Sachs in their financial analyses, for use in the potential sale process.\nAlso on July 28, 2022, Simpson Thacher sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland & Ellis that contemplated, among other things, that\nAvalara would be permitted a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision permitting Avalara to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, a\ncompany termination fee equal to 2.5% of transaction equity value (or, with respect to a proposal received from a party that made an alternative proposal\nduring the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, 1.25% of transaction equity value) and a reverse termination fee equal to 7.0% of transaction equity value.\nOn August 1, 2022, Kirkland & Ellis sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Simpson Thacher that contemplated, among other things, that Avalara\nwould be subject to a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision where it would not be able to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, a\ncompany termination fee equal to 3.5% of transaction equity value and a reverse termination fee equal to 4.5% of transaction equity value.\nOn August 2, 2022, on behalf of Avalara, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Vista to ask whether Vista still expected to\nsubmit a revised indication of interest by August 4, 2022. The representatives of Vista responded that they would seek to submit a revised indication of\ninterest by August 4, 2022.\nOn August 3, 2022, Mr. McFarlane spoke with representatives of Vista and noted that, if Vista were still interested in a potential transaction with Avalara,\nVista would need to submit a revised indication of interest promptly for the Board\u2019s consideration. Mr. McFarlane also emphasized that, while the Board\nwould have been willing to consider a transaction based on the valuation proposed in Vista\u2019s original indication of interest, the Board was unwilling to\nconsider a transaction at the valuation proposed in Vista\u2019s revised indication of interest and that Vista would need to meaningfully increase its proposed\nvaluation in order for the Board to consider a transaction.\nOn August 4, 2022, Simpson Thacher sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland & Ellis that contemplated, among other things, that Avalara\nwould be permitted a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision permitting Avalara to solicit alternative proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, a company\ntermination fee equal to 2.75% of transaction equity value (or, with respect to a proposal received from a party that made an alternative proposal during\nthe \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, 1.375% of transaction equity value) and a reverse termination fee equal to 6.5% of transaction equity value.\nLater on August 4, 2022, Vista verbally communicated to Goldman Sachs that they planned to submit a revised indication of interest at a price of $91.00\nper share, given their additional due diligence of the deterioration of Avalara\u2019s business following the submission of their previous indication. Following\ndiscussion with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management, representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with Vista their perspective that $91.00 per share\nwould likely not be attractive to the Board, and a higher price in the range of their initial indication of interest of $97.00-101.00 per share would be more\nlikely to be attractive to the Board.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThereafter, on August 4, 2022, Vista submitted to Goldman Sachs a revised indication of interest to acquire Avalara in an all-cash transaction that valued\nAvalara at $92.25 per share.\nIn the morning of August 5, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the directors their fiduciary\nduties. Members of Avalara\u2019s senior management reviewed with the Board the July Projections, Avalara\u2019s strategic plan, the challenges that could\nprevent Avalara from achieving its strategic plan, including a reduction in the growth of new and upsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and\nsales capacity issues, high attrition in Avalara\u2019s sales and marketing departments, the expected further reduction, and likely eventual elimination, of\nrevenue from its relationship with Partner A and additional challenges in Avalara\u2019s business, including the likely need for organizational changes to\noptimize Avalara\u2019s business, and the standalone prospects of Avalara in the near to medium term, including that Avalara was unlikely to be able to\nacquire Company A or other companies or businesses in the industries in, or adjacent to, which Avalara operates that members of Avalara\u2019s senior\nmanagement believed would be necessary to advance Avalara\u2019s strategic plan. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the market\nprice of Avalara\u2019s common stock compared to the market prices of other companies in the industries in which Avalara operates, including the fact that the\nmarket price of Avalara\u2019s common stock had increased by 28% since the media reports on July 7, 2022 speculating that Avalara had been contacted by\nVista regarding a potential acquisition compared to an average increase of 8-10% in the market prices of other companies in the industries in which\nAvalara operates. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed with the Board the terms of Vista\u2019s revised indication of interest and its preliminary\nfinancial analyses based on the July Projections, and representatives of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the Board material issues in the most recent draft\nof the merger agreement, including whether a \u201cgo-shop\u201d or \u201cno-shop\u201d provision would be included. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reminded the\nBoard that, since the media reports on July 7, 2022 speculating that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition, several\nadditional private equity firms had contacted them to express interest in potentially participating in a transaction involving Avalara, but none had\nproposed an independent acquisition of Avalara, none of the private equity firms had submitted any oral or written indication of interest following such\ncontacts, and no strategic party had contacted Goldman Sachs or Avalara to express interest, so the representatives of Goldman Sachs did not believe\nthat there were additional parties that would be likely to make a proposal to acquire Avalara. Following discussion, including of whether Vista\u2019s revised\nindication of interest resulted in greater value to Avalara shareholders compared to remaining a standalone company and continuing to execute on\nAvalara\u2019s strategic plan, the Board met first in executive session without members of management present, other than Mr. McFarlane, and then met in an\nindependent session, without Mr. McFarlane present. Following the conclusion of the executive session, the Board instructed Goldman Sachs and\nAvalara\u2019s senior management to seek a further improved proposal from Vista of $95.00 per share or greater that could include a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision if\nsuch a higher valuation were proposed by Vista in light of the Board\u2019s conclusion that no additional parties would be likely to make a proposal to acquire\nAvalara regardless of whether a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision were included in the merger agreement.\nLater on August 5, 2022, following discussion with Avalara\u2019s senior management and consistent with the Board\u2019s directives, at the direction of Avalara,\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs proposed to Vista that it increase its proposed valuation to $95.75 per share, at which valuation the merger agreement\ncould include a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision, but the merger agreement would also need to include a company termination fee equal to less than 3.0% of\ntransaction equity value and a reverse termination fee equal to 6.5% of transaction equity value. In response, representatives of Vista informed Goldman\nSachs that Vista would not be able to proceed at such proposed valuation and that it would cease any further work on a potential transaction. Following\nadditional discussion with Avalara\u2019s senior management and consistent with the Board\u2019s directives, at the direction of Avalara, representatives of\nGoldman Sachs proposed to Vista that it submit a \u201cbest and final\u201d offer.\nIn the evening of August 5, 2022, Vista verbally communicated a further revised indication of interest to Goldman Sachs reflecting its \u201cbest and final\u201d\noffer, proposing a potential acquisition of Avalara by Vista for\n44\nTable of Contents\n$93.50 per share in cash, conditioned on a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision, a company termination fee equal to 2.75% of transaction equity value and a reverse\ntermination fee equal to 5.50% of transaction equity value.\nLater in the evening of August 5, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board their discussions\nwith Vista over the course of the day and Vista\u2019s further revised \u201cbest and final\u201d indication of interest. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed for\nthe Board the remaining material issues related to the merger agreement and the debt and equity financing commitments of Vista required for the proposed\ntransaction. Following discussion and the Board\u2019s conclusion that no higher value could be obtained from Vista, the Board instructed Avalara\u2019s senior\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher to continue to explore the proposed transaction with Vista and finalize negotiation of the terms of the\nmerger agreement and related documentation by August 7, at which time the Board would formally review the proposed transaction and determine\nwhether to adopt the merger agreement. Later in the evening of August 5, 2022 following the Board meeting, Vista confirmed its earlier verbal indication of\ninterest in writing.\nOn August 6, 2022 and August 7, 2022, Simpson Thacher and Kirkland & Ellis exchanged several drafts of, and held discussions, some of which included\nmembers of Avalara\u2019s senior management and representatives of Vista, regarding, the merger agreement and related documents.\nOn August 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs provided the July Projections and the extrapolation of the July Projections for fiscal years 2026 through 2042 to Vista.\nIn the evening of August 7, 2022, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference with members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of Avalara\u2019s senior management reviewed with the Board the\nnegotiations with Vista regarding the merger agreement. At the request of the Board, Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board its financial analysis of the\nmerger consideration and delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 8,\n2022, to the effect that, as of the date of its written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in\ncash per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly\nowned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman\nSachs is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. See also the section of this\nproxy statement entitled \u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d beginning on page 53. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the Board\ntheir fiduciary duties in connection with the consideration of the merger agreement and proposed transaction, the terms of the negotiated merger\nagreement, the debt and equity financing commitments required for the proposed transaction and the other documentation related to the merger. A\nrepresentative of Simpson Thacher then described the resolutions before the Board. After discussion, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Avalara and its\nshareholders, (ii) adopted the merger agreement and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of\nthe transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, (iii) subject to the terms of the merger agreement, resolved to recommend that the\nshareholders of Avalara vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and (iv) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the\nshareholders of Avalara at a special meeting of shareholders for their approval.\nFollowing the adoption by the Board of the merger agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby, early in the morning on August 8, 2022, the\nparties executed the merger agreement and the other documentation related to the proposed transaction. Concurrently with the execution of the merger\nagreement, Vista delivered executed debt and equity financing commitment letters providing for the committed debt and equity financing required for the\nproposed transaction.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOn August 8, 2022, prior to commencement of trading of Avalara\u2019s common stock on the NYSE, Avalara issued a press release announcing the proposed\ntransaction.\nRecommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger",

            "text": "Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\nThe Board unanimously recommends that Avalara shareholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal.\nAt a meeting of the Board held on August 7, 2022, after an extensive review process, the Board unanimously (i) determined that it was advisable and in\nthe best interest of Avalara and Avalara shareholders that Avalara enter into the merger agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger and\nthe merger agreement, (iii) resolved that the approval of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by Avalara shareholders at a special\nmeeting of Avalara shareholders and (iv) recommended that Avalara shareholders approve the merger agreement.\nWhen you consider the Board\u2019s recommendation, you should be aware that Avalara\u2019s executive officers and directors may have interests in the merger\nthat may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Avalara shareholders generally. These interests are described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of\nAvalara Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.\u201d\nFactors Considered Supporting Approval of the Merger.\nIn the course of reaching its decision, the Board consulted with members of Avalara senior management and our financial and legal advisors and\nconsidered a significant amount of information and a number of factors that it believed supported its decision, including the following (not necessarily in\norder of relative importance):\nThe merger consideration represents a significant premium across a number of measuring periods. The Board considered that the merger consideration\nof $93.50 per share in cash was an attractive value for the shares of Avalara common stock and represented:\n\u2022\na 27.1% premium over the $73.54 closing price of Avalara common stock on July 6, 2022 (the last trading day prior to media reports\nspeculating that Avalara had been contacted by Vista regarding a potential acquisition)\u037e\n\u2022\na 28.9% premium over the volume weighted average price of Avalara common stock of $72.55 reported for the 5-trading day period ended\nJuly 6, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na 21.5% premium over the volume weighted average price of Avalara common stock of $76.93 reported for the 30-trading day period ended\nJuly 6, 2022\u037e and\n\u2022\na 18.2% premium over the volume weighted average price of Avalara common stock of $79.11 reported for the 90-trading day period ended\nJuly 6, 2022.\nStrategic alternatives to a sale of the Company. The Board considered the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing Avalara shareholders\nassociated with possible strategic alternatives to the merger (including the potential shareholder value based on our strategic plan that could be expected\nto be generated from remaining an independent public company and the possibility of acquisitions of other companies, as well as the potential benefits,\nrisks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives), and the timing and difficulty of accomplishing such alternatives, including the unsuccessful\ndiscussions that Avalara had engaged in with Company A. Based on the foregoing, the Board considered that none of these options, on a risk-adjusted\nbasis, was reasonably likely to create value for Avalara shareholders greater than the merger consideration in the foreseeable future.\nRisks relating to remaining a stand-alone company. The Board evaluated Avalara\u2019s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an independent public\ncompany, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such\n46Table of Contents\nplan. This evaluation included the Board\u2019s review of our business, operations, assets, operating results, financial condition, prospects, business strategy,\ncompetitive position, and industry, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of those factors on the trading price of our\ncommon stock, to assess the prospects and risks associated with remaining an independent public company. The Board believed that the certainty\nprovided by the acquisition of Avalara by Parent for $93.50 per share in cash was more favorable to Avalara shareholders than the potential risk-adjusted\nvalue of remaining an independent public company, after accounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing upon our\nbusiness and financial plans in the short- and long-term. Such risks include:\n\u2022\nour competitive positioning and prospects as an independent publicly traded company, which included consideration of our financial\nresources and ability to respond to new and evolving threats and challenges, including the difficulty of being able to acquire Company A or\nother companies or businesses in the industries in which Avalara operates that members of Avalara\u2019s senior management believed would be\nnecessary to achieve Avalara\u2019s strategic plan\u037e\n\u2022\nthe current and prospective business environment in which Avalara operates, including international, national and local economic\nconditions, the competitive environment (including increased competition in the United States and internationally), and the likely effect of\nthese factors on Avalara and the execution of Avalara\u2019s plans as a standalone company\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to sustain our historical revenue growth and achieve profitability and expand our international operations, including a reduction\nin the growth of new and upsell bookings as a result of execution challenges and sales capacity issues in the second quarter of 2022, which\nreduction was expected to increase in the remainder of fiscal year 2022, and the expected further reduction, and the possible elimination, of\nrevenue from its relationship with Partner A\u037e\n\u2022\nreductions in regulatory and compliance requirements for certain customers in non-U.S. jurisdictions that have reduced the growth rate for,\nand profitability of, Avalara\u2019s products and services\u037e\n\u2022\nchallenges of making potential investments and decisions around human resources to achieve long-term growth prospects while a publicly\ntraded company that is subject to scrutiny based on its quarter-over-quarter performance, including high attrition in Avalara\u2019s sales and\nmarketing departments and the likely need for organizational changes to optimize Avalara\u2019s business if Avalara were to remain a standalone\ncompany\u037e\n\u2022\nour recent second quarter financial results, which were below management\u2019s expectations of our financial performance on revenue and the\nfirst quarter since Avalara\u2019s initial public offering where Avalara would not beat public market analysts\u2019 expectations of revenue and\nincrease its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such performance on Avalara\u2019s expected performance for the remainder of the\n2022 fiscal year, which would likely have required Avalara to modify its public guidance that had been previously disclosed by Avalara\u2019s\nsenior management in its first quarter earnings release, including to reduce expected revenue and, by a smaller amount, increase non-GAAP\noperating income, had the merger agreement not been executed\u037e and\n\u2022\nother risks and uncertainties discussed in Avalara\u2019s public filings with the SEC. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on\npage 113 of this proxy statement.\nProcess to explore a sale of the Company. The Board considered the strategic process that Avalara undertook, with the assistance of its financial advisor,\nto evaluate its strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of Avalara, which included the outreach conducted during the potential sale process by\nour financial advisor during which it engaged with various other parties and the fact that none of those other parties demonstrated a substantial interest\nin acquiring Avalara or presented a proposal as compelling as the one presented by Parent and that there was limited outreach from other third parties\nfollowing the multiple media reports and market speculation regarding a potential acquisition of Avalara.\n47\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of factors such as the processes conducted by Avalara with the assistance of its financial advisor at the Board\u2019s direction and the periodic\nconversations Avalara has had with other parties over the few months, the Board believed that it had an informed understanding of the parties most likely\nto be willing and able to acquire or engage in other strategic transactions with Avalara. Specifically, Goldman Sachs conducted direct outreach to eight\nfinancial sponsors that Avalara and its financial advisor believed were likely to be most interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of Avalara. The\nBoard noted that these parties had been afforded the opportunity to participate in discussions with Avalara with respect to a potential transaction, but\nthat such discussions did not progress beyond a preliminary stage, as more fully described above under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 33. Goldman Sachs had also had discussions with other parties that had contacted them following media reports speculating on a\npotential acquisition of Avalara to express interest in potentially participating in a transaction involving Avalara, including as a potential source of\nfinancing, but none of which had expressed interest in an independent acquisition of Avalara.\nThe Board also considered that (a) only Parent and Party A had submitted formal, written indications of interest to acquire Avalara, (b) Party A did not\nsubmit a definitive proposal and ceased to participate in the potential sale process and (c) only Parent had submitted a definitive proposal to acquire\nAvalara at the time the Board approved the merger agreement. The Board also took note of the terms of the merger agreement, including that if an\ninterested party were to submit a proposal that the Board determined was a superior proposal (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Other Covenants and Agreements\u2014Acquisition Proposals,\u201d beginning on page 88) the Board could, prior to Avalara shareholders\napproving the merger agreement and subject to complying with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including paying the termination fee of\n$242.329 million, terminate the merger agreement and cause Avalara to enter into a definitive agreement for such superior proposal if the Board determined\nin its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected\nto be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Board considered in its view that the terms of the merger agreement were unlikely to\ndeter any interested parties from making a proposal to Avalara.\nCash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, which provides certainty of value and\nimmediate liquidity to Avalara shareholders upon the consummation of the merger, in comparison to the risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in\nremaining an independent public company. The Board weighed the certainty of realizing a compelling value for shares of Avalara common stock by virtue\nof the merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value for the Avalara common stock would approach the merger consideration in the\nforeseeable future, which the Board concluded was unlikely. In reaching such conclusion, the Board considered a number of factors, including that\nAvalara\u2019s market value immediately prior to the execution of the merger agreement reflected the increase in market value as a result of the media reports\nspeculating on a potential acquisition of Avalara, that, if the Board were to not engage in a transaction, Avalara\u2019s market value would likely decline,\npotentially significantly, as a result of Avalara\u2019s second quarter results being below management\u2019s expectations and the first quarter since Avalara\u2019s initial\npublic offering where Avalara would not beat public market analysts\u2019 expectations and increase its revenue guidance for the year, and the effect of such\nperformance on Avalara\u2019s expected performance for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year, which would likely have required Avalara to modify its public\nguidance that had been previously disclosed by Avalara\u2019s senior management in its first quarter earnings release, including to reduce expected revenue\nand, by a smaller amount, increase non-GAAP operating income, and the deterioration in the financial markets, and the risks and uncertainties associated\nwith our business.\nNegotiations with Parent. The Board considered the extensive negotiations Avalara and its legal counsel had with Parent, including throughout the\nperiod of time from June 23, 2022, which was the day Parent first submitted a written indication of interest, to the date on which the merger agreement was\nexecuted on August 8, 2022, and that the negotiations were conducted on arms\u2019 length and that the members of Avalara\u2019s senior management and the\nrepresentatives of Vista did not have any substantive discussions on the role, responsibilities or compensation of Avalara\u2019s management team following\nthe closing. The Board also considered and discussed at length with its financial and legal advisors the revised indication of interest submitted by Vista\non July 19,\n48\nTable of Contents\n2022, which was at a lower proposed price than the what was proposed in Vista\u2019s original indication of interest submitted on June 23, 2022 in light of\nAvalara\u2019s second quarter results being below management\u2019s and public market analysts\u2019 expectations and the deterioration in the financial markets. The\nBoard also considered that Parent increased its proposed price per share from $91.00 per share in its July 19, 2022 revised indication of interest to $92.25\nper share in its revised indication of interest submitted on August 4, 2022, and that Parent further increased its proposed price per share to $93.50 per\nshare in its final indication of interest submitted on August 5, 2022, and its belief that the $93.50 per share price represented the highest price per share\nthat Parent was willing to pay for the Avalara common stock, considering the extensive due diligence conducted by Parent, the financing proposed by\nParent and the negotiations between the parties, and that the negotiations with Parent had resulted in the highest price reasonably available to Avalara\nunder the circumstances and the merger agreement contained terms and conditions that were, in the Board\u2019s view, advisable and favorable to Avalara and\nits shareholders. The Board further considered that no other potential buyer submitted and maintained an offer to acquire Avalara at a purchase price per\nshare that was greater than the $93.50 per share price to be paid in the proposed merger.\nAntitrust regulatory approvals. The Board considered that the merger agreement only contemplated the receipt of approval under the HSR Act as the\nsole regulatory approval required for the consummation of the merger, and the Board considered Parent\u2019s obligation under the merger agreement to take,\nor cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary and proper under applicable laws and regulations in a timely manner\nas are necessary to eliminate each impediment to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and obtain all approvals\nrequired under the HSR Act, subject to certain limitations specified in the merger agreement, including agreeing to accept certain specified divestitures or\nrestrictions to the extent necessary to obtain such approvals.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs. The Board considered the financial analyses presented by representatives of Goldman Sachs at the Board\u2019s meeting on\nAugust 7, 2022, as well as the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 8, 2022,\nto the effect that, as of the date of its written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in cash per\nshare of Avalara\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common\nstock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The Goldman Sachs opinion is more fully described in\n\u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d and the full text of the Goldman Sachs opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.\nEconomic conditions. The Board considered the current state of the economy, debt financing markets and uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic\nconditions both in the near term and the long term, which could negative affect our financial performance.\nMerger agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the structure of the transaction, the all-cash form\nof the merger consideration, the limited conditions to closing, the customary nature of the representations, warranties, and the covenants and agreements\nof the parties. The Board further considered the course and nature of negotiations with Parent, which were conducted at arm\u2019s length and during which\nthe Board was advised by independent legal and financial advisors on a regular basis. The Board took into account the terms of the merger agreement,\nincluding:\n\u2022\nParent\u2019s covenants in furtherance of obtaining required regulatory approvals, subject to certain limitations described in the merger\nagreement\u037e\n\u2022\nAvalara\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with a third party, if the Board determines\nin good faith, after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the third party has made a competing proposal\nthat constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal\u037e\n49\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe right of the Board to change its recommendation that Avalara shareholders approve the merger agreement in connection with a superior\nproposal, subject to certain restrictions and the requirement that we pay Parent the applicable termination fee if the Board makes a change in\nrecommendation and the merger agreement is terminated as a result\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief that our obligation to pay Parent a termination fee of $242.329 million, or approximately 2.75% of the aggregate equity\nvalue of the transaction, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, as well as the right of Parent to match any\ncompeting proposal that the Board in good faith determines constitutes a superior proposal in accordance with the terms of the merger\nagreement, are reasonable under the circumstances and would not preclude other potential acquirers from making an alternative proposal to\nacquire Avalara if they were interested in making such a proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe right of Avalara to terminate the merger agreement if Parent fails to consummate the merger in breach of the merger agreement, and the\nobligation of Parent, under specified circumstances, to pay Avalara a reverse termination fee of $484.659 million upon such termination\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe right of Avalara to seek an injunction, specific performance and other equitable remedies if needed in order to prevent breaches of the\nmerger agreement by Parent.\nVista\u2019s capabilities. The Board considered Vista\u2019s financial capacity to complete an acquisition of this size and its prior track record of completing\nacquisitions, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Vista could be completed efficiently and in an orderly manner.\nFinancing. The Board considered the fact that Parent has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable institutions, and that\nParent has obtained committed equity financing from the Investors for the full amount of equity required in connection with such committed debt\nfinancing, as well as the fact that Parent must use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the debt financing and the equity financing and that\nsuch funding, together with the projected cash balances at Avalara, provides an amount sufficient to cover the aggregate merger consideration, all fees\nand expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the surviving corporation in connection with the merger and the financing, the repurchase of\nAvalara\u2019s outstanding convertible notes and all other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the surviving corporation in connection therewith.\nBoard\u2019s independence and comprehensive review process. The Board considered the fact that the Board consisted of a majority of independent directors\nwho unanimously approved the merger agreement following extensive discussions with Avalara\u2019s management team, representatives of its financial\nadvisor and outside legal counsel, and also took into consideration the financial expertise and prior industry experience held by a number of directors.\nShareholders\u2019 ability to reject the merger. The Board considered the fact that the merger is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of Avalara\ncommon stock, and that shareholders would be able to reject the merger.\nDissenters\u2019 rights. The Board considered the fact that shareholders who do not vote for the approval of the merger agreement and who follow certain\nprescribed procedures will have the right to dissent from the merger and demand appraisal of the fair value of their shares under the WBCA.\nOther Factors Considered by the Board.\nIn the course of reaching its decision, the Board also considered and balanced against the potential benefits of the merger a number of potentially\nadverse factors concerning the merger, including the following:\nNo further shareholder participation in future gains. The Board considered the fact that Avalara would no longer exist as an independent public\ncompany following the merger and that Avalara shareholders would forgo\n50\nTable of Contents\nany future increase in Avalara\u2019s value following the merger that might result from our earnings or possible growth as an independent company. Although\nthe Board was optimistic about Avalara\u2019s prospects on a stand-alone basis and our strategic plan, the Board concluded that there were a number of\nsignificant risks associated with remaining an independent company (including as described in more detail above) that in many cases were difficult to\nquantify and that the premium reflected in the merger consideration constituted fair compensation for the loss of the potential shareholder benefits that\ncould reasonably be expected to be realized by our strategic plan in the foreseeable future, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis.\nRegulatory risk. The Board considered the risk that the approval under the HSR Act may be delayed, conditioned or denied, and the risk that the\napplicable governmental agencies may seek to impose unfavorable terms or conditions, or otherwise fail to grant, such approvals.\nRisks associated with announcement and pendency of the merger. The Board considered the risk that the announcement and pendency of the merger\nmay cause substantial harm to relationships with our employees, sales representatives, customers or strategic partners or may divert management and\nemployee attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business. The Board also considered our ability to attract and retain key personnel while\nthe proposed transaction is pending and the potential adverse effects on our financial results as a result of that disruption, as well as the possibility of\nany suit, action or proceeding in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.\nRisks associated with a failure to consummate the merger. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019\nobligations to consummate the merger will be satisfied, and as a result there can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, even if the merger is\napproved by Avalara shareholders. The Board noted the fact that, if the merger is not completed, (i) Avalara will have incurred significant risk, transaction\nexpenses and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee\nattrition and a potentially negative effect on our business and customer relationships, (ii) depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to\nbe completed and, given that Avalara\u2019s recent second quarter financial results were below management\u2019s expectations and, as a result, Avalara\u2019s public\nguidance would likely need to be revised, including a reduction in expected revenue and an increase, by a smaller amount, in non-GAAP operating\nincome, the price of Avalara common stock would likely decline, potentially significantly, and (iii) the market\u2019s perception of Avalara\u2019s prospects could be\nadversely affected.\nRestrictions on the operation of our business. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the\nmerger, which could delay or prevent Avalara from realizing certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations that we\nmight otherwise take absent the pending merger.\nAbility to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals. The Board considered the fact that the merger agreement precludes us from actively soliciting\nalternative proposals. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded to Parent under the merger agreement to\nre-negotiate the terms of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a\nbusiness combination with, or an acquisition of, Avalara. The Board further considered the possibility that the termination fee payable to Parent if the\nmerger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances might have the effect of discouraging alternative acquisition proposals or reducing the price\nof such proposals. However, the Board also considered that the structure of the transaction as a merger would result in detailed public disclosure and\nsubstantial time prior to consummation of the merger during which an unsolicited superior proposal could be submitted. In addition, the Board\nconsidered the specific provisions of the merger agreement, which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, permit Avalara to furnish information to\nand conduct negotiations with third parties that make unsolicited acquisition proposals, and permit the Board to change its recommendation to Avalara\nshareholders regarding the merger agreement and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior\nproposal, in accordance\n51\nTable of Contents\nwith the terms of the merger agreement and subject to payment of a termination fee to Parent. The Board further considered its belief that the $242.329\nmillion termination fee (which is equivalent to approximately 2.75% of equity value of Avalara) payable by Avalara (i) is reasonable in light of the overall\nterms of the merger agreement and the benefits of the merger, (ii) was comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, and (iii) would not\npreclude another party from making a competing proposal.\nTax treatment. The Board considered the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to Avalara shareholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nReverse termination fee. The Board considered the fact that, if it believed Parent and Merger Sub failed to consummate the merger when the closing of\nthe merger should have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement and Avalara was unable to obtain specific performance to compel Parent to perform\nits obligations under the merger agreement, then Avalara\u2019s only remedy is the right, in certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement and\nreceive a reverse termination fee of $484.659 million from Parent, which may not be sufficient to compensate Avalara for losses suffered as a result of a\nbreach or termination of the merger agreement by Parent.\nTransaction costs. The Board considered the fact that Avalara has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in\nconnection with the merger, regardless of whether the merger is consummated.\nShareholder litigation. The Board considered the impact on Avalara of potential shareholder litigation in connection with the merger.\nPotential differing interests of directors and officers. The Board considered that, aside from their interests as Avalara shareholders, Avalara\u2019s directors\nand executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Avalara shareholders generally. See \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Interests of Avalara\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement.\nOther risks. The Board considered the types and nature of the risks and uncertainties set forth in Avalara\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021 and the subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and current reports on Form 8-K under\nItem 1A \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nWhile the Board considered potentially positive and potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that, overall, the potentially positive factors\noutweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, the Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and\nfair to, and in the best interest of, Avalara and its shareholders.\nThe foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the\nmerger, but it includes the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by the Board in that regard. In view of the number and variety\nof factors and the amount of information considered, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify, or\notherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in reaching its determination.

            "text": "Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGoldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated August 8, 2022, that, as of the date of the\nwritten opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock to\nbe paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders\nof the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock pursuant to the merger agreement\nwas fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 8, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. The summary of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\ncontained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion. Goldman Sachs provided\nadvisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman\nSachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Avalara\u2019s common stock should vote with respect to the merger, or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Avalara for the four fiscal years ended December 31, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nAvalara\u2019s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein last amended on June 13, 2018, relating to an\ninitial public offering of the shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nAvalara\u2019s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated June 4, 2019, relating to follow-on public\nofferings of the shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Avalara\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from Avalara to its stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Avalara\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Avalara (which are referred to as the July Projections and the July Extrapolations and\nsummarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement) prepared\nby its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Avalara, which are referred to in this section of this proxy statement as the\n\u201cForecasts\u201d, and certain analyses related to the expected utilization by Avalara of certain net operating loss carryforwards of Avalara (which\nare referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the \u201cNOL Forecasts\u201d and are also summarized in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement) prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019\nuse by Avalara.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Avalara regarding their assessment of the past and current business\noperations, financial condition and future prospects of Avalara\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Avalara common stock\u037e compared\ncertain financial and stock market information for Avalara with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded\u037e\nreviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses, and\nconsidered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of Avalara\u2019s board of directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting\n53Table of Contents\nand other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that\nregard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of Avalara\u2019s board of directors that the Forecasts and the NOL Forecasts were reasonably prepared on\na basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of Avalara. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation\nor appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Avalara or any of its\nsubsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents\nand approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger in any\nway meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement,\nwithout the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Avalara to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as\ncompared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Avalara\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara\u2019s\ncommon stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara\nand the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock pursuant to the\nmerger agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the\nmerger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with\nthe merger, or the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities,\ncreditors, or other constituencies of Avalara\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of Avalara, or class of such persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the $93.50 in cash per share of\nAvalara\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary\nof Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock pursuant\nto the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and\nstock markets on Avalara, Parent or the merger, or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of Avalara or Parent or the ability of Avalara\nor Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and\nother conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for\nupdating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019\nadvisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of Avalara\u2019s board of directors in connection with its consideration of\nthe merger and its opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock should vote with respect to\nthe merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board in connection with rendering the opinion\ndescribed above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs,\nnor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of\nthe financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone\nnot a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is\nbased on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 5, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement of the\nmerger, and is not necessarily indicative of current or future market conditions.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Forecasts and the NOL Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow\nanalysis on Avalara to derive a range of illustrative present values\n54\nTable of Contents\nper share of Avalara\u2019s common stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 11.50% to 15.50%,\nreflecting estimates of Avalara\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) estimates of\nunlevered free cash flow (less stock-based compensation expenses) for Avalara for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 and the fiscal years\n2023 through 2042 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Avalara, which were calculated by applying perpetuity\ngrowth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow (less stock-based compensation expenses) to be\ngenerated by Avalara, as provided by Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Avalara management. Goldman Sachs derived such\ndiscount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Avalara\u2019s target capital\nstructure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for\nAvalara, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of illustrative perpetuity growth rates for Avalara\nwas estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding\nlong-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. In addition, assuming discount rates ranging from 11.50% to 15.50%, reflecting an estimate\nof Avalara\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of Avalara\u2019s net\noperating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for the fiscal years 2022 through 2042, as reflected in the NOL Forecasts.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Avalara by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Avalara the amount of Avalara\u2019s total debt and debt-like\nitems and added the amount of Avalara\u2019s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022, as provided by Avalara management and approved\nfor Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Avalara management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Avalara. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of\nillustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock, as provided by Avalara management\nand approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Avalara management, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share\nof Avalara\u2019s common stock ranging from $54.74 to $112.95.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative\nfuture value per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a\ncompany\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s financial multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years\n2022 to 2025. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise values for Avalara as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by\napplying a range of multiples of enterprise value to Avalara\u2019s next twelve months (\u201cNTM\u201d) revenue (which is referred to as \u201cEV/NTM revenue multiple\u201d)\nof 6.5x to 9.5x to estimates of Avalara\u2019s revenue for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025. The range of illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiples was derived\nby Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples for Avalara\nand current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples for certain publicly traded companies, as described below in the section captioned \u201cSelected Public\nCompany Comparables Analysis.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Avalara\u2019s total debt and debt-like items and added the amount of Avalara\u2019s unrestricted cash and cash\nequivalents as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, each as provided by Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use\nby Avalara management, from the respective enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for each of the\nfiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares\nof Avalara\u2019s common stock for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, calculated based on estimated annual dilution and the number of fully diluted shares\nof Avalara\u2019s common stock, each as provided by Avalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Avalara management, using the treasury\nstock method, to derive a range of implied future equity values per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied\nfuture equity values per share to\n55\nTable of Contents\nAugust 5, 2022 using an illustrative discount rate of 13.75%, reflecting an estimate of Avalara\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate\nby application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain\nfinancial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $75.42 to $125.43 per share\nof Avalara\u2019s common stock.\nSelected Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the\nsoftware industry since 2013. For each of the selected transactions where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the\nimplied EV/NTM revenue multiple of the applicable target company based on the total consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s NTM consensus revenue based on Factset, IBES estimates or select Wall Street research at the time each such selected transaction was\nannounced.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nAnnouncement Year\nTarget\nAcquiror\nEV/NTM Revenue\n2022\nPing Identity\nThoma Bravo\n7.7x\n2022\nZendesk\nPermira & H&F\n5.5x\n2022\nSailPoint\nThoma Bravo\n12.9x\n2022\nDatto\nKaseya / Insight\n8.0x\n2022\nAnaplan\nThoma Bravo\n12.8x(1)\n2022\nMandiant\nGoogle\n9.7x\n2021\nMedallia\nThoma Bravo\n10.8x\n2021\nProofpoint\nThoma Bravo\n9.1x\n2020\nPluralsight\nVista\n8.5x\n2020\nSlack\nSalesforce\n28.4x(2)\n2019\nTableau\nSalesforce\n10.9x\n2019\nUltimate Software\nHellman & Friedman\n8.4x\n2018\nApptio\nVista\n7.1x\n2018\nSendGrid\nTwilio\n11.5x\n2018\nAdaptive Insights\nWorkday\n10.9x\n2018\nMuleSoft\nSalesforce\n15.7x\n2016\nNetsuite\nOracle\n8.6x\n2016\nDemandware\nSalesforce\n8.9x\n2016\nMarketo\nVista\n5.9x\n2016\nCvent\nVista\n6.1x\n2015\nSolarwinds\nThoma Bravo\n7.7x\n2014\nConcur\nSAP\n10.2x\n2013\nSourcefire\nCisco\n7.7x\nMedian (All Transactions)\n8.9x\nMedian (All Transactions\u2014Cash Only)\n8.5x\n(1)\nReflects revised purchase price of $63.75 per share as announced on June 6, 2022.\n(2)\nAs of pre-announcement date as disclosed in Slack\u2019s Form S-4.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWhile none of the companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Avalara, the companies in the selected transactions are companies\nwith operations, results, market sizes and product profiles that, for the purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Avalara\u2019s\noperations, results, market size and product profile.\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyses of the various transactions and its professional judgment and\nexperience, Goldman Sachs selected a reference range of EV/NTM revenue multiples of 7.0x to 12.0x and applied such range to Avalara\u2019s NTM revenue, to\nderive a range of implied enterprise values for Avalara. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values the amount of\nAvalara\u2019s total debt and debt-like items and added the amount of Avalara\u2019s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022, as provided by\nAvalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Avalara management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Avalara. Goldman\nSachs divided the range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock, as provided by\nAvalara management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Avalara management, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied equity\nvalues per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock of $79.08 to $132.25.\nPremia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions\nannounced during the time period from January 1, 2017 through August 5, 2022 involving a public company based in the United States as the target\nwhere the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were between $5 billion and $20 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available\ninformation, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in each of the transactions relative to the\ntarget\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 29% across the\nperiod. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 19% and 75th percentile premium of 49% across the period. Using this analysis and its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 19% to 49% to the undisturbed closing price per\nshare of Avalara\u2019s common stock of $73.54 as of July 6, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock of\n$87.51 to $109.57.\nSelected Public Company Comparables Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for Avalara and\nfor the following publicly traded corporations in the software industry, which we refer to in this section of the proxy statement as the \u201cSelected\nCompanies\u201d:\n\u2022\nAlteryx, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nBigCommerce Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022\nBlackLine, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nCoupa Software Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nDatadog, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nElastic N.V.\u037e\n\u2022\nHubSpot, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nMongoDB, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nOkta, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nPagerDuty, Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nPaylocity Holding Corporation\u037e\n57\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nShopify Inc.\u037e\n\u2022\nSmartsheet Inc.\u037e and\n\u2022\nZscaler, Inc.\nAlthough none of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to Avalara, the Selected Companies included were chosen because they are publicly\ntraded companies in the software industry with operations that for purposes of this analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Avalara.\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of August 5, 2022 as a multiple of NTM revenue for each of the Selected Companies, in\neach case based on financial and trading data as of August 5, 2022, information Goldman Sachs obtained from public filings, FactSet and Capital IQ,\npublicly available historical and market data and Institutional Brokers\u2019 Estimate System estimates (\u201cIBES estimates\u201d). This analysis resulted in a median\nEV/NTM revenue multiple for the Selected Companies of 8.1x.\nImplied Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the $93.50 in cash per share of\nAvalara\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent, Avalara, any wholly owned subsidiary\nof Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock pursuant\nto the merger agreement.\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock relative to:\n\u2022\n$73.54, the undisturbed closing price for Avalara\u2019s common stock on July 6, 2022, the last trading day prior to media reports regarding a\npotential sale of Avalara (which we refer to as the \u201cUndisturbed Share Price\u201d in this section of this proxy statement)\u037e\n\u2022\n$95.55, the closing price for Avalara\u2019s common stock on August 5, 2022, the last trading day prior to the signing of the merger agreement\n(which we refer to as the \u201cCurrent Share Price\u201d in this section of this proxy statement)\u037e\n\u2022\n$72.55, the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as \u201cVWAP\u201d in this section of this proxy statement) of Avalara\u2019s common stock\nover the 5-trading-day time period ended July 6, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c5-day Undisturbed VWAP\u201d in this section of this proxy\nstatement)\u037e\n\u2022\n$76.93, the VWAP of Avalara\u2019s common stock over the 1-month trading time period ended July 6, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c1-month\nUndisturbed VWAP\u201d in this section of this proxy statement)\u037e\n\u2022\n$79.11, the VWAP of Avalara\u2019s common stock over the 3-month trading time period ended July 6, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c3-month\nUndisturbed VWAP\u201d in this section of this proxy statement)\u037e and\n\u2022\n$189.88, the highest closing trading price of shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock over the 52-week period ended August 5, 2022 (which we\nrefer to as the \u201c52-week High\u201d in this section of this proxy statement).\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:\nCommon Stock Reference Price\nImplied\nPremium\nRepresented\nby $93.50 in\nCash per\nShare of\nAvalara\u2019s\nCommon\nStock\nUndisturbed Share Price of $73.54\n27%\nCurrent Share Price of $95.55\n(2)%\n5-day Undisturbed VWAP of $72.55\n29%\n1-month Undisturbed VWAP of $76.93\n22%\n3-month Undisturbed VWAP of $79.11\n18%\n52-week High of $189.88\n(51)%\n58\nTable of Contents\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to Avalara, Parent or the merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a financial point of\nview of the $93.50 in cash per share of Avalara\u2019s common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent,\nAvalara, any wholly owned subsidiary of Avalara and the holders of the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the merger agreement)) of the outstanding\nshares of Avalara\u2019s common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the\nprices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual\nfuture results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to\nuncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Avalara, Parent,\nGoldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe merger consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Avalara and Parent and was approved by the Board. Goldman\nSachs provided advice to Avalara during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to\nAvalara or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its determination to\napprove the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in\nconnection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment\nmanagement and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.

The Capped Call Transactions consisted of the purchase by Avalara of\ncapped call options with respect to collectively approximately 4,099,635 shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock, the aggregate number of shares of Avalara\u2019s\ncommon stock underlying the Convertible Notes (at the initial conversion rate of 4.1940 shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock per $1,000 in principal amount\nof the Convertible Notes) (with 20% purchased from Goldman Sachs). The Convertible Notes had an initial strike price equal to $238.44 per share of\nAvalara\u2019s common stock, subject to an initial cap price of $323.30 per share. As of August 16, 2022, 100% of the Capped Call Transactions remain\noutstanding, with a strike price of $238.44 per share and a cap price of $323.30 per share.\nThe Capped Call Transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on Avalara stockholders of the conversion of the\nConvertible Notes and/or any potential cash payment in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes that Avalara may make in connection\nwith a cash settlement of the Convertible Notes, in each case, up to the cap price. The Capped Call Transactions, upon the exercise thereof, generally\nrequire the Capped Call Counterparties to deliver to Avalara upon expiration of the call options, a number of shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock (and/or in\ncertain circumstances, at Avalara\u2019s election, cash) determined based on the excess, if any, of the lower of the cap price and the price of the shares of\nAvalara\u2019s common stock at that time (determined over a period specified in the Capped Call Transactions) over the strike price per share of Avalara\u2019s\ncommon stock.\nThe Capped Call Transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance with their terms in connection with certain events.\nIn particular, under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, each of Goldman Sachs and the other Capped Call Counterparties, each acting separately\nas calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain circumstances to make adjustments on more than one\noccasion to the terms of such Capped Call Transactions to reflect the economic effect of the announcement of such events (including the merger) on the\nembedded call options. In addition, each of Goldman Sachs and the other Capped Call Counterparties may, acting separately as the calculation agent,\ndetermining party or otherwise as principal under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, determine such adjustments in respect of such\nCapped Call Transactions in accordance with their terms, including on or following consummation or abandonment of such events. All actions or\nexercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs, in its capacity as calculation agent, pursuant to the terms of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party,\nmust be performed in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner.\nAs a result of the Capped Call Transactions, the Capped Call Counterparties are expected to have market exposure to the price of the shares of Avalara\u2019s\ncommon stock. It is the ordinary practice of the Capped Call Counterparties to engage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the\nprice of the stock underlying privately negotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the Capped Call Transactions. In\nconnection with the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, Goldman Sachs (and its affiliates) have engaged, and will continue to engage, in\naccordance with applicable law in hedging and other market transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various derivative\ntransactions with respect to Avalara\u2019s common stock) that are generally intended to substantially neutralize Goldman Sachs\u2019 exposure as a result of the\nCapped Call Transactions to which it is a party to changes in the price of Avalara\u2019s common stock. Such hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs\u2019 own risk\nand may result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be greater than or less than the initial expected contractual benefit to Goldman Sachs under\nthe Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party. The amount of any such gain or loss will not be known until the applicable Capped Call Transactions\nhave been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs shall have completed all of its hedge unwind activities. To\nmitigate the exposure from the Capped Call Transactions, as of August 19, 2022, Goldman Sachs held a net long economic position of approximately\n75,000 shares of Avalara\u2019s common stock.\n61\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs provided to management of Avalara, for the information of the Board, materials that summarized, based on theoretical models, the\npotential effects of the announcement and of the consummation of an acquisition of Avalara on the Capped Call Transactions. The materials included\npreliminary illustrative analyses by Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division for a range of stated assumptions regarding takeout prices for shares of\nAvalara\u2019s common stock and volatilities, as well as based on other reasonable assumptions, in the event of an acquisition of Avalara for greater than 10\npercent cash consideration. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably\ndesigned to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its\nSecurities Division who are undertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs\u2019 capped call transactions. In connection\nwith the preparation of presentations to senior management of Avalara and the Board, personnel in Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division,\nincluding the representatives of Goldman Sachs who have advised Avalara in connection with the merger, from time to time, have received or may receive\ninput from personnel in Goldman Sachs\u2019 Securities Division into how to model, or reports of historical measures or estimates of, Goldman Sachs\u2019 and/or\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division\u2019s profit and/or loss over certain measurement periods related to the Capped Call Transactions.\nGoldman Sachs has advised Avalara that as of August 19, 2022, assuming the merger is consummated on December 31, 2022, Goldman Sachs expects to\nrealize a net gain of up to approximately $5 million with respect to the Capped Call Transactions as a result of the merger, after giving effect to its hedging\nactivities based on the ordinary hedging practices described above and based on a range of stated assumptions, including volatilities and other\nreasonable assumptions. The amount of any such gain will not be known until the Capped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in\naccordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities, and such amount may differ from the\nestimates provided above.\nThe indentures governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of the Capped Call Transactions were included as\nexhibits to Avalara\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 13, 2021, which contains additional disclosure regarding the Convertible\nNotes and a description of the Capped Call Transactions. All references in this section to share counts, conversion prices, cap prices and strike prices are\nsubject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the terms of the confirmations relating to the Capped Call Transactions.\nThe Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial\nexperience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated May 20, 2022, Avalara engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial\nadvisor in connection with the merger. The engagement letter between Avalara and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based\non the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $75 million, $5.0 million of which became payable at the announcement of\nthe transaction, and the reminder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, Avalara has agreed to reimburse Goldman\nSachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various\nliabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nFinancial Projections",

            "text": "Financial Projections\nIn our press releases announcing quarterly and annual earnings, Avalara has historically prepared and provided certain public guidance as to its\nprojected financial and operational results for its then-current fiscal quarter and fiscal year. Avalara does not otherwise, as a matter of course, make public\nprojections as to future sales, earnings, or other results.\nHowever, management of Avalara has prepared the prospective financial information set forth below to assist in the Board\u2019s oversight of Avalara\u2019s\nfinancial and operational performance in the ordinary course of business. The accompanying prospective financial information was not prepared with a\nview toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified\n62Table of Contents\nPublic Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of Avalara\u2019s management, was prepared on a reasonable basis,\nreflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of\naction and the expected future financial performance of Avalara. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily\nindicative of future results, and readers of this proxy are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.\nNeither Avalara\u2019s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to\nthe prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its\nachievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.\nTo assist the Board\u2019s oversight of Avalara\u2019s financial and operational performance in the ordinary course of business, Avalara\u2019s senior management\nregularly prepares projections of Avalara\u2019s financial and operational performance for the then-current fiscal year, which is updated for the Board each\nquarter following the completion of the previous quarter, and the succeeding three-year period. In connection with the Board\u2019s regularly scheduled April\n26-27, 2022 board meeting, Avalara\u2019s senior management prepared an updated version of certain unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal\nyears 2022 through 2024 that had been previously prepared for the Board\u2019s regularly scheduled board meeting held on October 26 and 27, 2021 to take\ninto account Avalara\u2019s performance for the remainder of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 and to include certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation for the 2025 fiscal year. In connection with the Board\u2019s review of Avalara\u2019s strategic alternatives, Avalara\u2019s senior management prepared\ncertain unaudited prospective financial information in May 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201cMay Projections\u201d) for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 that was\nsubstantially the same as the unaudited prospective financial information prepared for the Board\u2019s April meeting except for an increase in the projected\nfree cash flow. Following the completion of Avalara\u2019s fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022, in connection with the Board\u2019s regularly scheduled July 18-19,\n2022 board meeting, Avalara\u2019s senior management prepared an updated version of the May Projections to take into account Avalara\u2019s performance in the\nsecond quarter of 2022 and its impact for the remainder of the forecast period (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly Projections\u201d) and certain analyses related to\nthe expected utilization by Avalara of certain state and federal net operating loss carryforwards of Avalara (which we refer to as the \u201cNOL Forecasts\u201d).\nThe May Projections were made available to Vista and other potential bidders involved in the potential sale process in the course of their due diligence,\nand the July Projections were made available to Vista in the course of its due diligence. Avalara\u2019s senior management also prepared extrapolations of the\nMay Projections and the July Projections (the latter of which we refer to as the \u201cJuly Extrapolations\u201d) for fiscal years 2026 through 2042, which were\napproved by the Board and provided to Goldman Sachs along with the May Projections and the July Projections. The July Projections and the July\nExtrapolations were approved by the Board, and the NOL Forecasts were approved by Avalara\u2019s senior management and provided to the Board, for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s use for purposes of its financial analyses summarized above under \u201cOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.\u201d Goldman Sachs expressed\nno view or opinion as to these financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based. A summary of the May Projections and the July\nProjections (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cProjections\u201d) are set forth below.\nMay Projections\n(US$ in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nTotal Revenue\n$ 904\n$1,160\n$ 1,475\n$ 1,855\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit(1)\n$ 663\n$\n875\n$ 1,135\n$ 1,445\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)(2)\n$ (11)\n$\n55\n$\n150\n$\n275\n(1)\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit is defined as gross profit excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired\nintangible assets.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) is defined as operating income (loss) excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense and\namortization of acquired intangible assets.\n63\nTable of Contents\nJuly Projections and NOL Forecasts\n(US$ in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nTotal Revenue\n$ 869\n$1,106\n$1,405\n$1,793\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit(1)\n$ 640\n$ 833\n$1,083\n$1,421\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)(2)\n$\n0\n$\n52\n$ 140\n$ 273\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(3)\n$\n27\n$\n88\n$ 187\n$ 334\nStock Based Compensation\n$ 139\n$ 188\n$ 225\n$ 269\nTotal Net Operating Losses Used(4)\n$\n0\n$\n0\n$\n0\n$\n0\nGAAP Operating Income (Loss)(5)\n$(163)\n$ (160)\n$ (109)\n$\n(19)\n(1)\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit is defined as gross profit excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired\nintangible assets.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) is defined as operating income (loss) excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense and\namortization of acquired intangible assets.\n(3)\n\u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d is defined as Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss), less estimated cash taxes excluding the effect of utilization of state\nand federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) where applicable, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, plus change in deferred\nrevenues, less other changes in net working capital. In performing its discounted cash flow analysis, Goldman Sachs used Unlevered Free Cash\nFlow, less Stock Based Compensation expense, plus the effect of utilization of NOLs where applicable.\n(4)\nNet operating losses were not forecasted as being used during fiscal years 2022 through 2025 and are forecasted as being used during a portion of\nthe period covered by the July Extrapolations.\n(5)\nGAAP Operating Income (Loss) is defined as operating income (loss) including the effects of stock-based compensation expense and amortization\nof acquired intangible assets.\nThe Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical\nspecificity, the Projections are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by\nAvalara\u2019s management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons,\nincluding general economic conditions, competition, and the risks discussed in this proxy statement under the sections entitled \u201cCautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 23. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject\nto change. Because the Projections were developed for Avalara on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to the merger, they do not reflect any\nchanges to Avalara\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the Projections will\nbe realized, and actual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the Projections relate, the less\npredictable and more unreliable the information becomes.\nThe Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Avalara believes are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future\nresults. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in\ncompliance with GAAP. While Avalara believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand\nAvalara\u2019s operating results and to analyze Avalara\u2019s financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the\nuse of these non-GAAP financial measures, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Avalara may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts\nused by other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are limited because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be\nincluded in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures were relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its\nfinancial analyses and opinion and by the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor in\nconnection with a business combination transaction are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would\notherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of\n64\nTable of Contents\nnon-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs or Vista for purposes of its financial analyses and opinions or by the Board in\nconnection with its consideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures.\nNone of Avalara or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ\nfrom the Projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Projections to reflect circumstances\nexisting after the date the Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions\nunderlying the Projections, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Avalara does not intend to make\npublicly available any update or other revision to the Projections, even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. Avalara has\nmade publicly available its actual results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 on Avalara\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC\non February 24, 2022 (and amended on May 5, 2022) and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 on Avalara\u2019s Quarterly Reports\non Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 6, 2022 and August 9, 2022, respectively. None of Avalara or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, or other\nrepresentatives has made or makes any representation to any Avalara shareholder or other person regarding Avalara\u2019s ultimate performance compared to\nthe information contained in the Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved. Avalara has made no representation to Parent, in the merger\nagreement or otherwise, concerning the Projections.\nInterests of Avalara\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger",

The merger constitutes a\n\u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the equity awards held by our non-employee directors and executive officers. The Options and RSUs held by non-\nemployee directors accelerate upon a \u201cchange in control\u201d pursuant to their terms. Accordingly, any unvested Options and RSUs held by non-employee\ndirectors as of immediately prior to the effective time will accelerate upon consummation of the merger. Equity awards held by our executive officers do\nnot automatically accelerate upon a \u201cchange in control\u201d pursuant to their existing terms. However, as further described below, all Options (whether vested\nor unvested) will be cancelled for cash consideration in connection with the merger, and certain \u201cdouble trigger\u201d acceleration benefits will continue to\napply to cash awards received in respect of unvested RSUs and PSUs held by the executive officers in connection with the merger (as further described\nbelow).\nOptions, RSUs, and PSUs will be treated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides for the following:\n\u2022\nOptions: Each outstanding and unexercised Option, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a\ncash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such Option multiplied by (ii) the\nexcess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the exercise price per share under such Option, less any applicable withholding\ntaxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each Option with an exercise price per share greater than or equal to the per share merger\nconsideration will be cancelled automatically at the effective time for no consideration.\n\u2022\nRSUs: Each outstanding RSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time or that vests as a result of the\nconsummation of the merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes required to\nbe withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to such vested RSU, multiplied by (ii)\nthe per share merger consideration. Each outstanding RSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be\nconverted into the contingent right to receive from Parent or Avalara a Converted Cash Award equal to (i) the total number of shares of\nAvalara common stock subject to such unvested RSU multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding\ntaxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Unless provided otherwise in the merger agreement, each such Converted Cash Award will\ncontinue to have, and be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions that applied to the corresponding unvested RSU forfeited\nimmediately prior to the effective time. Each executive officer\u2019s employment agreement provides that in the event the executive officer is\nterminated by Avalara without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d within 12 months following a change in control, the executive\nofficers\u2019 outstanding\n66Table of Contents\nequity awards will accelerate. The parties to the merger agreement agreed that such qualifying termination provisions will continue to apply\nto the Converted Cash Awards following the merger.\n\u2022\nPSUs. Each outstanding PSU that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive\nan amount in cash (less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law) equal to (i) the total number of shares of\nAvalara common stock subject to such vested PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement),\nmultiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration. Each outstanding PSU that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time will be converted into (without interest) a Converted Cash Award with respect to an amount equal to (i) the total number of\nshares of Avalara common stock subject to such unvested PSU (as determined in accordance with the merger agreement), multiplied by (ii)\nthe per share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law. Each such Converted\nCash Award will have, and be subject to, the vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement to the corresponding\nunvested PSUs forfeited immediately prior to the effective time. The time-vesting schedule and qualifying termination acceleration\nprovisions applicable to the executive officers are further described below.\n\u2022\nThere are two groups of unvested PSU awards outstanding: (i) unvested PSUs with an initial performance period commencing on\nJanuary 1, 2021 (the \u201c2021 PSUs\u201d) and (ii) unvested PSUs with an initial performance period commencing on January 1, 2022 (the\n\u201c2022 PSUs\u201d). Pursuant to the time-vesting schedule set forth in each executive officer\u2019s PSU award agreement, the Converted Cash\nAwards will time-vest in substantially equal quarterly installments over the remaining performance periods applicable to the original\nPSU award. More specifically, vesting will commence on the first quarterly date following closing of the merger, and will end on\nJanuary 5, 2024 for the 2021 PSUs and January 5, 2025 for the 2022 PSUs. Vesting is generally contingent upon each executive officer\u2019s\ncontinued employment through each applicable vesting date, subject to full acceleration upon an executive officer\u2019s termination of\nemployment by Avalara without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in each case, within 12 months following closing of\nthe merger.\n\u2022\nFor purposes of the merger agreement, the number of shares of Avalara common stock subject to the unvested PSU will be calculated\nas follows: (i) with respect to the 2021 PSUs, calculated assuming performance was achieved at 220% of target, and (ii) with respect to\nthe 2022 PSUs, calculated assuming performance was achieved at 147.5% of target, in each case, subject to reducing such calculated\nnumber of shares by the number of vested PSUs earned for a previously completed performance period. However, the calculation\nmethod in the immediately preceding sentence (the \u201cMerger Agreement Method\u201d) will only apply if the holder of the unvested PSU\nexecutes a waiver agreement prior to closing. If the holder does not execute a waiver agreement, then the total number of shares of\nAvalara common stock subject to such holder\u2019s unvested PSU will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the holder\u2019s PSU\naward agreement. With respect to the executive officers, if the terms of their PSU award agreements apply (in lieu of the Merger\nAgreement Method), the number of shares subject to the unvested PSUs will be calculated as follows: (a) if the effective time occurs\nprior to the end of the first performance period, calculated assuming performance was achieved at target, (b) if the effective time\noccurs on or after completion of a performance period but prior to the vesting date (i.e., the date the compensation committee certifies\nperformance), calculated based on actual performance, and (c) if the effective time occurs on or after the first performance period but\nprior to completion of the third performance period, calculated assuming performance was achieved at the greater of (A) target minus\nthe number of vested PSUs earned for a previously completed performance period or (B) actual performance (based on performance\nfor an abbreviated performance period that ends with the close of the Avalara\u2019s fiscal quarter coincident with or immediately prior to\nthe effective time) minus the number of vested PSUs earned for a previously completed performance period. However, the total\nnumber of shares calculated shall not exceed 250% of the target PSUs granted.\n67\nTable of Contents\nPayments for Unvested Awards\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be realized by each of our named executive officers in respect of their unvested equity awards see the \u201cGolden\nParachute Compensation\u201d section below. In addition, the estimated aggregate amount that would be realized by Avalara\u2019s non-employee directors in\nsettlement of their Options and RSUs in accordance with the merger agreement is $2,729,531 (calculated based on unvested RSUs and Options\noutstanding as of September 9, 2022, and assuming the effective time occurs on November 1, 2022).\nDirectors\u2019 and Officer\u2019s Indemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Avalara\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification, expense\nadvancement and insurance arrangements.

            "text": "Dissenters\u2019 Rights\nGeneral\nUnder Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, instead of receiving the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement,\nholders of Avalara\u2019s common stock are entitled to dissent from the merger and to obtain payment of the fair value of their shares in cash together with\naccrued interest from the effective time if the merger is consummated. The following summarizes the material rights of holders of Avalara common stock\nunder Chapter 23B.13. You should read the applicable sections of Chapter 23B.13, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement, and\nwhich governs dissenters\u2019 rights. The summary below is qualified in its entirety by reference to Chapter 23B.13, and such statute, and not this summary,\ngoverns the exercise of dissenters\u2019 rights.\nPursuant to Chapter 23B.13.200 of the WBCA, when a proposed merger is to be submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, as in the case of the\nspecial meeting, the meeting notice must state that shareholders are or may be entitled to assert dissenters\u2019 rights under Chapter 23B.13 and must be\naccompanied by a copy of Chapter 23B.13. The notice of the special meeting included with this proxy statement constitutes notice to the holders of\nAvalara common stock of their dissenters\u2019 rights, and a copy of Chapter 23B.13 is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nIf you are contemplating the possibility of exercising your dissenters\u2019 rights in connection with the merger, you should carefully review the text of\nChapter 23B.13. If you do not fully and precisely satisfy the procedural requirements of Chapter 23B.13, you will forfeit your dissenters\u2019 rights. If any\nholder of shares of Avalara common stock who asserts dissenters\u2019 rights under the WBCA withdraws or forfeits (through failure to perfect or otherwise)\nthe right to obtain payment for such holder\u2019s shares under Chapter 23B.13, then such shareholder\u2019s shares will be converted, or will be treated as if they\nhad been converted, into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding of taxes. Avalara will\nnot provide you with any notice regarding your dissenters\u2019 rights other than as described in this proxy statement and the notice of the special meeting\nincluded with this proxy statement.\nRequirements for Exercising Dissenters\u2019 Rights\nIf you wish to assert your dissenters\u2019 rights, you must:\n\u2022\ndeliver to Avalara, before the vote is taken at the special meeting regarding the merger agreement, written notice of your intent to demand\npayment for your shares of Avalara common stock if the merger is effected, which notice must be separate from your proxy. Your vote\nagainst the merger agreement alone will not constitute written notice of your intent to assert your dissenters\u2019 rights\u037e\n\u2022\nnot vote your shares in favor of the merger agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nfollow the statutory procedures for perfecting dissenters\u2019 rights under Chapter 23B.13, which are described below under the heading\n\u201cDissenters\u2019 Rights Procedures.\u201d\n74Table of Contents\nIf you fail to comply with these requirements, then if the merger agreement is approved by Avalara\u2019s shareholders and the merger is completed, your\nshares of Avalara common stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable\nwithholding of taxes, but you will have forfeited your dissenters\u2019 rights with respect to your shares of Avalara common stock.\nWritten notice of your intent to assert dissenters\u2019 rights must be delivered to Avalara at:\nAvalara, Inc.\n255 South King Street, Suite 1800\nSeattle, Washington 98104\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\n(206) 470-7000\nThis written notice must be delivered before the vote to approve the merger proposal is taken at the special meeting. Your written notice to demand\npayment should specify your name and mailing address, the number of shares of Avalara common stock you own, and that you intend to demand\npayment of the \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares of Avalara common stock if the merger agreement is approved.\nVote\nYou must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the approval of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, by\nproxy, via the Internet, by telephone, or in person, will constitute a waiver of your dissenters\u2019 rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any\npreviously filed written notices of your intent to assert dissenters\u2019 rights. A proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted\nin favor of the approval of the merger agreement. Therefore, a shareholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise dissenters\u2019 rights must vote\nagainst the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the merger agreement.\nTermination of Dissenters\u2019 Rights\nYour right to obtain payment of the fair value of your shares of Avalara common stock under Chapter 23B.13 will terminate if:\n\u2022\nthe merger is abandoned or rescinded\u037e\n\u2022\na court having jurisdiction permanently enjoins or sets aside the merger\u037e or\n\u2022\nyour demand for payment is withdrawn with Avalara\u2019s written consent.\nDissenters\u2019 Rights Procedures\nIf the merger agreement is approved by Avalara shareholders, within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, Avalara will send written notice\nregarding the proper procedures for dissenting to all shareholders who have given written notice under Chapter 23B.13 to the address above and have\nnot voted in favor of approval of the merger agreement. The notice will:\n\u2022\nstate where the demand for payment and certificates representing certificated shares of Avalara common stock must be sent and when\ncertificates for certificated shares must be deposited\u037e\n\u2022\ninform holders of uncertificated shares as to what extent transfer of the shares will be restricted after the payment demand is received\u037e\n\u2022\ninclude a form for demanding payment that includes the date of the first announcement to the news media or to shareholders of the terms of\nthe merger (which was August 8, 2022) and requires that the person asserting dissenters\u2019 rights certify whether or not the person acquired\nbeneficial ownership of Avalara common stock before that date\u037e\n75\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nindicate the date by which Avalara must receive a payment demand, which date will not be fewer than 30 or more than 60 days after the date\nthe written notice is delivered to shareholders\u037e and\n\u2022\ninclude a copy of Chapter 23B.13.\nIf you wish to assert dissenters\u2019 rights, no later than the date set forth in the notice described above you must demand payment, certify whether you\nacquired beneficial ownership of your shares before August 8, 2022, and deposit your Avalara share certificates (or deliver your book entry shares) in\naccordance with the terms of the notice. Failure to do so by the date set forth in the notice will cause you to forfeit the right to obtain payment of the fair\nvalue for your shares under Chapter 23B.13.\nIf the merger is not consummated within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment and depositing share certificates, then Avalara will be required\nto return all deposited certificates and release any transfer restrictions imposed on uncertificated shares. If, after returning the deposited certificates and\nreleasing transfer restrictions, the parties to the merger agreement wish to consummate the mergers, Avalara must send a new dissenters\u2019 rights notice\nand repeat the payment demand procedure.\nWithin 30 days after the later of the effective date of the merger or the date the payment demand is received, Avalara shall pay each dissenting\nshareholder who complied with the payment demand and related requirements of Chapter 23B.13.230 of the WBCA (other than dissenting shareholders\nwho acquired their shares of Avalara common stock after August 8, 2022, if Avalara elects to withhold payment as described below) the amount that\nAvalara estimates to be the fair value of the shareholder\u2019s shares, plus accrued interest. For purposes of Chapter 23B.13, \u201cfair value\u201d with respect to a\ndissenter\u2019s shares, means the value of the shares immediately before the effective date of the corporate action to which the dissenter objects, excluding\nany appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action unless exclusion would be inequitable. \u201cInterest\u201d means interest from the effective\ndate of the merger until the date of payment, at the average rate currently paid by Avalara on its principal bank loans or, if none, at a rate that is fair and\nequitable under all the circumstances. The payment will be accompanied by:\n\u2022\nfinancial data relating to Avalara, including a balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the date of\npayment, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in shareholders\u2019 equity for that year, and the latest available interim\nfinancial statements, if any\u037e\n\u2022\nan explanation of how Avalara estimated the fair value of the shares\u037e\n\u2022\nan explanation of how Avalara calculated the interest\u037e\n\u2022\na statement of the dissenter\u2019s right to demand supplemental payment if such shareholder believes that the amount paid is less than the fair\nvalue of the shares or under certain other circumstances enumerated in Chapter 23B.13.280 and described below\u037e and\n\u2022\na copy of Chapter 23B.13.\nFor dissenting shareholders who were not the beneficial owners of their shares of Avalara common stock before August 8, 2022, Avalara may elect to\nwithhold payment under Chapter 23B.13. To the extent that Avalara so elects, after consummating the merger, Avalara shall estimate the fair value of the\nshares, plus accrued interest, and shall pay this amount to each dissenter who agrees to accept it in full satisfaction of the dissenter\u2019s demand. Avalara\nwill send with its offer an explanation of how it estimated the fair value of the shares, an explanation of how the interest was calculated, and a statement of\nthe dissenter\u2019s right to demand payment of the dissenter\u2019s own estimate of the dissenter\u2019s shares and the amount of interest due if such dissenter\nbelieves that the amount offered is less than the fair value of the shares or under certain other circumstances enumerated in Chapter 23B.13.280 and\ndescribed below.\nIf you believe that the amount paid or offered by Avalara is less than the fair value of your shares or believe that the interest due is incorrectly calculated,\nor if Avalara fails to make payment for your shares within 60 days\n76\nTable of Contents\nafter the date set for demanding payment or the merger is not consummated and Avalara does not return the deposited share certificates or release the\ntransfer restrictions imposed on uncertificated shares within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment, you may, within 30 days of the payment or\noffer for payment, deliver notice to Avalara in writing informing it of your own estimate of the fair value of your shares and the amount of interest due,\nand demand payment of this estimate, less any amount Avalara has already paid under Chapter 23B.13. If any dissenting shareholder\u2019s demand for\npayment of such dissenting shareholder\u2019s own estimate of the fair value of the shares is not settled within 60 days after receipt by Avalara of such\nshareholder\u2019s demand for payment, Chapter 23B.13 requires that Avalara commence a proceeding in King County Superior Court and petition the court to\ndetermine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest, naming all the dissenting shareholders whose demands remain unsettled as parties to the\nproceeding. If Avalara does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it will pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the\namount demanded.\nThe jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced will be plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more appraisers to\nreceive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers will have the powers described in the order appointing them, or\nin any amendment to it. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings. The fair value of the shares as\ndetermined by the court may be less than, equal to or greater than the value of the merger consideration to be issued to non-dissenting shareholders for\nAvalara common stock under the terms of the merger agreement if the merger is consummated. Shareholders should be aware that investment banking\nopinions as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a merger are not opinions as to fair value under Chapter 23B.13.\nEach dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to a judgment (a) for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter\u2019s\nshares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by Avalara, or (b) for the fair value, plus accrued interest, of the dissenter\u2019s after-acquired shares for which\nAvalara elected to withhold payment pursuant to Chapter 23B.13.\nThe court will also determine the costs and expenses of the court proceeding and assess them against Avalara, except that the court may assess the costs\nagainst all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not\nin good faith in demanding payment under Chapter 23B.13. If the court finds that Avalara did not substantially comply with the requirements of Chapter\n23B.13.200 through 23B.13.280 of the WBCA, the court may also assess against Avalara any fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective\nparties, in amounts the court finds equitable. The court may also assess those fees and expenses against any party if the court finds that the party has\nacted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to dissenters\u2019 rights. If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of\nsubstantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against Avalara, the court may\naward to counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenters who were benefited.\nA record shareholder may assert dissenters\u2019 rights as to fewer than all of the shares registered in the shareholder\u2019s name only if the shareholder dissents\nwith respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one person and delivers to Avalara a notice of the name and address of each person on whose behalf\nthe shareholder asserts dissenters\u2019 rights. The rights of a partially dissenting record shareholder are determined as if the shares as to which the dissenter\ndissents and the dissenter\u2019s other shares were registered in the names of different shareholders. Beneficial owners of Avalara common stock who desire\nto assert dissenters\u2019 rights as to shares held on the beneficial owners\u2019 behalf (a) must submit to Avalara the record shareholder\u2019s consent to the dissent\nnot later than the time the beneficial shareholder asserts dissenters\u2019 rights, which consent shall be set forth either in a record or, if Avalara has designated\nan address, location, or system to which the consent may be electronically transmitted and the consent is electronically transmitted to the designated\naddress, location, or system, in an electronically transmitted record\u037e and (b) must so assert dissenters\u2019 rights with respect to all shares of which such\nshareholder is the beneficial shareholder or over which such shareholder has power to direct the vote.\n77\nTable of Contents\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT",

This proposal, commonly known as \u201csay-on-golden parachute,\u201d is referred to in this proxy statement as the named executive officer merger-\nrelated compensation advisory proposal.

Because the vote to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation advisory proposal is only\nadvisory in nature, it will not be binding on Avalara, Parent, Merger Sub, or the surviving corporation.

            "text": "MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER\nThe following summary is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to \u201cU.S. holders\u201d and \u201cnon-U.S.\nholders\u201d (in each case, as defined below) whose shares of Avalara common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger. This summary\nis based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial\nauthority, and administrative rulings, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax\nconsequences to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (collectively, \u201cholders\u201d) as described herein. No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d)\nhas been or will be sought with respect to any aspect of the merger. This summary is for the general information of the holders only and does not purport\nto be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the merger. For example, it does not consider the effect of the Medicare tax on net investment\nincome, of any applicable state, local or foreign income tax laws, or of any non-income tax laws. This summary applies only to holders that hold their\nAvalara common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this\ndiscussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of the holder\u2019s particular\ncircumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:\n\u2022\na bank, insurance company, or other financial institution\u037e\n\u2022\na tax-exempt organization\u037e\n\u2022\na governmental agency or instrumentality\u037e\n\u2022\na retirement plan, individual retirement account or other tax-deferred account\u037e\n\u2022\nan entity or arrangement treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, S corporation or other pass-through entity (or an\ninvestor in such an entity or arrangement)\u037e\n\u2022\na real estate investment trust or regulated investment company\u037e\n\u2022\na dealer or broker in stocks and securities or currencies\u037e\n\u2022\na trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment\u037e\n\u2022\na holder subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\na holder that received its shares through the exercise of an employee stock option, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as\ncompensation\u037e\n\u2022\na U.S. holder that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\na \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d or corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal\nincome tax\u037e\n\u2022\na holder that exercises dissenters\u2019 rights\u037e\n\u2022\na foreign pension fund and its affiliates\u037e\n\u2022\na holder that holds shares as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion, or other integrated transaction\u037e or\n\u2022\na U.S. expatriate.\nIf an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Avalara common stock, the U.S. federal income tax\ntreatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Avalara common stock\nand partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them.\n108Table of Contents\nThis discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Please consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the merger to you in light of your particular circumstances, as well as any tax consequences of the merger arising under the U.S.\nfederal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws, under \u201cgolden parachute\u201d rules, under any state, local\nor non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.\nU.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Avalara common stock that is:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United\nStates, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons (as defined in\nthe Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.\nTreasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nThe exchange of Avalara common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder\nwhose shares of Avalara common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted\ntax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be\ndetermined separately for each block of shares of Avalara common stock (i.e., shares of Avalara common stock acquired at the same cost in a single\ntransaction). If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of Avalara common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must\ndetermine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of Avalara common stock that it holds. U.S. holders\nwho own separate blocks of Avalara common stock should consult their own tax advisors with respect to these rules.\nSuch gain or loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Avalara common stock\nexceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders are generally eligible for reduced rates\nof taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nIn general, information reporting will apply to payments made to a U.S. holder in connection with the merger, unless the holder is an \u201cexempt recipient.\u201d A\nbackup withholding tax may apply to such payments if such holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or\nfails to report in full dividend and interest income. To avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption may complete\nand return IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a United States person (within the meaning of the Code), the taxpayer identification number\nprovided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or credit against a\nU.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.\n109\nTable of Contents\nNon-U.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Avalara common stock (other than an entity or arrangement\nclassified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder. Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of\nAvalara common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required\nby an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares of\nAvalara common stock for cash pursuant to the merger and certain other conditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of the Avalara common stock\nat any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and Avalara is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year\nperiod preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held Avalara common stock.\nA non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized as if the non-\nU.S. holder were a U.S. holder, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also\nbe subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower rate provided by an applicable\ntreaty). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate provided by an\napplicable treaty) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even though the individual\nis not considered a resident of the United States.\nGenerally, a corporation is a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d if the fair market value of its \u201cUnited States real property interests\u201d equals\nor exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business\n(all as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). Avalara believes it is not and has not during the five-year period preceding the merger been a\n\u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to payments made to a non-U.S. holder in connection with the\nmerger effected within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the beneficial owner certifies under\npenalty of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial\nowner is a United States person as defined under the Code), or such owner otherwise establishes an exemption.\nA non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding if such holder properly certifies (e.g., on the appropriate IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-\n8BEN-E, or other applicable IRS Form W-8) under penalty of perjury and in compliance with any IRS rules that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the applicable\nwithholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person as defined under the Code), or such\nholder otherwise establishes an exemption.\n110\nTable of Contents\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-\nU.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the non-U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.\nTHIS SUMMARY OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX\nADVICE. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nCONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION\nOF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER\nARISING UNDER THE FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES, UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAXING\nJURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.\n111\nTable of Contents\nFUTURE AVALARA SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS",

If the merger is not completed, Avalara shareholders will continue to be entitled to attend and\nparticipate in Avalara\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders.\nAs described in our proxy statement for our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, if Avalara holds its 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, shareholder\nproposals for the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders must be received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on December\n22, 2022, and must have satisfied the other conditions established by the SEC, including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. For any\nproposal that is not submitted for inclusion in next year\u2019s proxy statement, but is instead sought to be presented directly at the 2023 annual meeting of\nshareholders, shareholders are advised to review our bylaws as they contain requirements with respect to advance notice of shareholder proposals not\nintended for inclusion in our proxy statement and director nominations. To be timely, a shareholder\u2019s written notice of the proposal or nomination must be\ndelivered to and received by our Corporate Secretary in accordance with Section 2.6.1 of our bylaws. Our bylaws require that such notice be given not\nless than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders, or in the\nevent that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than 70 days after such\nanniversary date, to be timely such notice must be delivered to and received by the Corporate Secretary no earlier than 120 days prior to the next annual\nmeeting and no later than the later of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which a public announcement of the\ndate of the meeting was first made. To be timely for the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder\u2019s notice must be received by us between\nFebruary 8, 2023, and March 10, 2023. Such proposals should be delivered or mailed to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive\noffice, which is Avalara, Inc., 255 South King Street, Suite 1800, Seattle, WA 98104. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or\npostponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder\u2019s notice as described above.\nThese shareholder notices must contain information required by our bylaws. We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate\naction with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements. If a matter is properly brought before our next\nannual meeting under the procedures outlined in this section, the proxy holders named by our Board will have the discretion to vote on such matter\nwithout having received directions from shareholders delivering proxies to them for such meeting, provided, that our proxy statement for our next meeting\nbriefly describes the matter and how the proxy holders intend to vote on it.\nIn addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our bylaws with respect to advance notice of any nomination, shareholders who intend to\nsolicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the company\u2019s nominees for the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders in accordance with SEC\nRule 14a-19 must provide notice to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at the address above no later than April 10, 2023. Any such notice of intent to\nsolicit proxies must comply with all the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-19.\n112Table of Contents\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION",
