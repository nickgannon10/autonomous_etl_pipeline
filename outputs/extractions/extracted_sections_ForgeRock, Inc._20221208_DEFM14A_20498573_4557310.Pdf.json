We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement,\nincluding the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which we refer in this proxy statement. You\nmay obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the\ninstructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nOn October 10, 2022, we announced that ForgeRock entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger\nagreement, Parent will acquire ForgeRock for $23.25 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to complete\nthe merger, our stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of\nour common stock as of the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This\napproval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.\u201d The ForgeRock Board is furnishing this\nproxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of our common stock in connection with the\nsolicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special meeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the\nmerger agreement, the special meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed\nmaterials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock without attending the special\nmeeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy\nas soon as possible.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on ForgeRock?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of ForgeRock by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is\napproved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or\nwaived, Merger Sub will merge with and into ForgeRock, with ForgeRock continuing as the surviving\ncorporation.

If you attend the special meeting and vote at\nthe special meeting, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.\nQ:\nHow does the ForgeRock Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe ForgeRock Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger\nagreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive\nofficers in connection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time,\nto a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to\nadopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other\nreason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with\nthe merger. Instead: (1) ForgeRock will remain an independent public company\u037e (2) our Class A common stock\nwill continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act\u037e and (3) we will\ncontinue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nIn specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, ForgeRock has agreed to pay Parent (or\nits designee) a termination fee.\nFor more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination\nFees and Remedies.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the merger?\nA:\nThe compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection\nwith the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of\nForgeRock\u2019s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in\nnature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent or its affiliates (including, following the\nconsummation of the merger, the surviving corporation) to our named executive officers in connection with or\nfollowing the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cProposal 2: Approval, on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related\nExecutive Compensation.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock\nto our named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nA:\nForgeRock is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of the\ncompensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with\nthe merger is not required to consummate the merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if ForgeRock\u2019s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become\npayable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nA:\nApproval of the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in\nconnection with the merger is not a condition to consummation of the merger. This is an advisory vote and will\nnot be binding on ForgeRock or Parent. The underlying plans and arrangements providing for such\ncompensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nAccordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated, the\ncompensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with\nthe merger will or may be paid to ForgeRock\u2019s named executive officers even if our stockholders do not approve\nsuch compensation.\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d If you are a\nstockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf\nof ForgeRock. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares at the\nspecial meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of our common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock\nheld in \u201cstreet name,\u201d this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee\nwho is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you\nhave the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their\ninstructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the\nstockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a \u201clegal proxy\u201d\nfrom your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker automatically vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to\nbe considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You\nshould follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without\ninstruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a quorum or voted on the proposals,\nwhich will have the same effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no\neffect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become\npayable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger or the adjournment\nproposal.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your\nconvenience)\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the internet address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling the toll-free (within the United States or Canada) phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the\nenclosed proxy card.\nThe control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your\nshares of our common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when\nvoting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is no charge for voting your shares, if\nyou vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and\ntelephone charges for which you will be responsible.\nEven if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our common\nstock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d to vote shares that you\nbeneficially own, you may still vote your shares of our common stock at the special meeting even if you have\npreviously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will\nrevoke any previously submitted proxy.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your\nbank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,\nbroker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically\nover the internet or by telephone.

Online check-in will begin a\nfew minutes prior to the special meeting. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting\ninstruction form in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your shares). As the special\nmeeting is virtual, there will be no physical meeting location.\nEven if you plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special\nmeeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is\nprovided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions found on the proxy card).

Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be\nconsidered at the special meeting without your instructions. Without your instructions, your shares will not be\ncounted for purposes of a quorum or voted at the meeting, which will have the same effect as voting against the\nadoption of the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhy did ForgeRock choose to hold a virtual special meeting?\nA:\nThe ForgeRock Board decided to hold the special meeting virtually in order to facilitate stockholder attendance\nand participation by enabling stockholders to participate fully, and equally, from virtually any location around\nthe world, at no cost. However, you will bear any costs associated with your internet access, such as usage\ncharges from internet access providers and telephone companies. We believe this is the right choice for a\ncompany with a global footprint. A virtual special meeting makes it possible for more stockholders (regardless of\nsize, resources or physical location) to have direct access to information, while saving us and our stockholders\ntime and money. We also believe that the online tools that we have selected will increase stockholder\ncommunication. We remain very sensitive to concerns that virtual meetings may diminish stockholder voice or\nreduce accountability. Accordingly, we have designed our virtual format to enhance, rather than constrain,\nstockholder access, participation and communication.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of our common\nstock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is\ncalled a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is\ncalled a \u201cproxy card.\u201d You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by telephone or by\nthe Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Francis Rosch, John\nFernandez and Samuel Fleischmann, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy\nholders for the special meeting.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is\nvoted at the special meeting by:\n\u2022\nsigning another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting\u037e\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier\nsubmitted proxy\u037e\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary\u037e or\n\u2022\nattending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed\nproxy card.\nIf you hold your shares of our common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or other\nnominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the special meeting if you\nobtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will\nvote your shares in the way that you direct.\nIf you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the ForgeRock\nBoard with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger\nagreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive\nofficers in connection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time,\nto a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to\nadopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal\ncontaining instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the\nappropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented by your stock certificates. Unless\nyou are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the\ncash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you\nhold your shares of our common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead, the\npayment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger consideration upon receipt of a customary\n\u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d and any other items specified by the payment agent.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special\nmeeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective\ndate of the merger. If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the\nspecial meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the\nperson to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies ForgeRock in writing of such special\narrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger\nis completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those\nshares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record\ndate, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided\nfor your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions found on the proxy card).\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy\ncard and voting instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and\nmultiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than\none account.

This discussion is provided for general information only and does not constitute legal advice\nto any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is\nprovided in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of\nthe merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the\nmerger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nWhat governmental and regulatory approvals are required?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to\nthe merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and no agreement with any governmental\nauthority not to consummate the merger shall be in effect. In addition, the merger cannot be completed until all\nconsents, approvals and filings required under certain specified FDI laws have been obtained or made and all\nwaiting periods (including any extensions thereof) (including any timing agreements with applicable\ngovernmental authorities) relating to the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the\nconsummation of the merger shall have expired or otherwise been terminated under any such laws.\nForgeRock and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with\nthe FTC and the DOJ on October 24, 2022.

The failure to follow exactly the procedures\nspecified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of ForgeRock unless certain conditions are satisfied by the persons seeking\nappraisal.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe ForgeRock Board, together with senior management, regularly evaluates ForgeRock\u2019s strategic direction and\nongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening ForgeRock\u2019s business and enhancing stockholder value.\nAs part of this evaluation, the ForgeRock Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives.\nThese have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, ForgeRock\u2019s current\nbusiness plan, with ForgeRock remaining an independent entity\u037e (2) potential expansion opportunities through\nacquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships\u037e (3) various capital raising alternatives\u037e and (4) other\nfinancial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of ForgeRock.\nIn June 2021, after ForgeRock confidentially submitted a registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with its\ninitial public offering and before ForgeRock became a publicly listed company, at the direction of the ForgeRock\nBoard, representatives of J.P. Morgan and ForgeRock\u2019s other lead book-running manager in the initial public offering\ncontacted seven potential strategic acquirors, including Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C and Strategic D, and two\nfinancial sponsors, including Thoma Bravo, regarding a potential acquisition of ForgeRock. Of the contacted parties,\nThoma Bravo expressed interest in pursuing a potential transaction with ForgeRock. ForgeRock entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo containing a customary \u201cstandstill\u201d restriction that would terminate\nupon entry into a definitive agreement for an acquisition of ForgeRock. Thereafter, representatives of Thoma Bravo\nconducted due diligence with respect to ForgeRock\u2019s business. Thoma Bravo submitted two proposals to acquire\nForgeRock before ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering. At that time, the ForgeRock Board determined that ForgeRock\ncould achieve a more attractive valuation for our stockholders in an initial public offering. ForgeRock terminated\nthose discussions with Thoma Bravo regarding a potential acquisition in August 2021.\nFollowing its initial public offering, ForgeRock from time to time received inbound inquiries expressing a non-specific\ninterest in pursuing a potential transaction from a potential strategic acquiror (which is referred to as \u201cStrategic E\u201d)\nand three financial sponsors (which are referred to as \u201cSponsor A,\u201d \u201cSponsor B\u201d and \u201cSponsor C\u201d). Fran Rosch,\nForgeRock\u2019s chief executive officer, met with these parties from time to time to discuss ForgeRock\u2019s business and the\nindustry in which it operates\u037e other than as described below, these discussions did not advance beyond preliminary,\nhypothetical conversations regarding a potential transaction or result in the receipt by ForgeRock of an acquisition\nproposal. Mr. Rosch regularly updated Bruce Golden, as chairperson of the ForgeRock Board, on inquiries and\npreliminary discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions involving ForgeRock.\nOn January 31, 2022, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo to\ngenerally discuss updates on ForgeRock\u2019s business. At the meeting, the parties did not discuss a potential\nacquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn April 25, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo, at Mr. Rosch\u2019s invitation, to generally\ndiscuss the potential benefits of a technology partnership between ForgeRock and another company. Entities\naffiliated with Thoma Bravo had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire that other company on April 10, 2022.\nAt the meeting, the parties did not discuss a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn May 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with a senior executive of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request. During this\nmeeting, Thoma Bravo expressed a non-specific interest in an acquisition of ForgeRock but did not make a formal\nacquisition proposal. Mr. Rosch informed Thoma Bravo that ForgeRock would be open to discussing a potential\nacquisition. Thereafter, on or about May 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch updated Mr. Golden on the meeting with Thoma Bravo.\n34TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn May 25, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with a senior representative of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request. Thoma\nBravo informed Mr. Rosch that it would be submitting an offer to acquire ForgeRock at a purchase price of $23.00 per\nshare.\nLater on May 25, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo sent to ForgeRock a non-binding indication of interest\naddressed to the ForgeRock Board to acquire all of ForgeRock\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock for $23.00 per\nshare (which is referred to as the \u201cMay proposal\u201d), representing a 32% premium to ForgeRock\u2019s closing share price as\nof May 25, 2022. The May proposal also contemplated a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that would permit ForgeRock to solicit\nalternative bids for 30 days after signing a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma\nBravo. On May 26, 2022 Mr. Rosch informed Mr. Golden of ForgeRock\u2019s receipt of the May proposal.\nOn May 27, 2022, Mr. Rosch informed the ForgeRock Board that Thoma Bravo had submitted the May proposal.\nOn June 1, 2022, the ForgeRock Board held a meeting, with members of ForgeRock\u2019s management, representatives of\nWilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. (which we refer to as \u201cWilson Sonsini\u201d), ForgeRock\u2019s outside legal advisor,\nand, at the invitation of the ForgeRock Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan in attendance. As part of an ordinary\ncourse market update, the representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the ForgeRock Board the current market\nenvironment and ForgeRock\u2019s trading and financial performance since its initial public offering. The representatives\nof J.P. Morgan then left the meeting. Mr. Rosch reviewed the May proposal with the ForgeRock Board. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. It was proposed to establish a\nstrategic committee of the ForgeRock Board to work with ForgeRock\u2019s legal counsel and other advisors in connection\nwith ForgeRock\u2019s review of the May proposal, including its review of ForgeRock\u2019s standalone plan and the\nevaluation of other potential strategic alternatives. In considering the establishment of a strategic committee, the\nForgeRock Board discussed (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in the evaluation of the\nMay proposal and other strategic alternatives\u037e (2) the possibility that ForgeRock\u2019s management may need feedback\nand direction on relatively short notice in connection with a potential process of considering strategic alternatives\u037e\nand (3) the benefits and convenience of having a subset of directors oversee a potential process of considering\nstrategic alternatives. Following the discussion, the ForgeRock Board determined that it would form a strategic\ncommittee of the ForgeRock Board to evaluate the May proposal, including comparing the proposal to ForgeRock\u2019s\nstandalone plan and potential strategic alternatives.\nOn June 5, 2022, the ForgeRock Board, acting by unanimous written consent, established the strategic committee of\nthe ForgeRock Board (which we refer to as the \u201cStrategic Committee\u201d). The ForgeRock Board delegated authority to\nthe Strategic Committee to, among other things, (1) oversee and assist ForgeRock\u2019s management, advisors and\nconsultants with respect to the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives, including to explore, evaluate and\nconsider potential counterparties to a strategic transaction involving ForgeRock\u037e (2) explore, evaluate, consider,\nreview and negotiate the terms and conditions of any transaction relating to any strategic alternative\u037e and (3) if\nappropriate, recommend to the ForgeRock Board what action, if any, should be taken by ForgeRock with respect to\nany strategic alternative. The ForgeRock Board retained the power and authority to approve the entry into a\ndefinitive agreement relating to any strategic alternative, including a sale of ForgeRock. The ForgeRock Board also\ndetermined that it would continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic alternatives. The ForgeRock\nBoard appointed Mr. Golden, Jeff Parks and Dave Welsh, all of whom are independent members of the ForgeRock\nBoard, as the members of the Strategic Committee.\nOn June 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of ForgeRock\u2019s management and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Strategic Committee their\nfiduciary duties. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to engage a financial advisor in connection with the\nForgeRock Board\u2019s and Strategic Committee\u2019s review of the May proposal. The Strategic Committee requested that\nMr. Golden, with the assistance of ForgeRock management, meet with J.P. Morgan and report back to the Strategic\nCommittee.\nOn June 9, 2022, the Strategic Committee informed the ForgeRock Board of its selection of J.P. Morgan as\nForgeRock\u2019s financial advisor in connection with its evaluation of the May proposal. J.P. Morgan is well known to\nForgeRock given J.P. Morgan\u2019s service as a lead book running manager in ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering. The\nStrategic Committee selected J.P. Morgan to act as financial advisor to ForgeRock after considering J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nqualifications, extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of ForgeRock\u2019s business and the industry in\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich ForgeRock operates and experience in advising similar companies in connection with potential strategic\ntransactions. In addition, representatives from J.P. Morgan had from time-to-time presented to the ForgeRock Board\nand management about public market perspectives of ForgeRock.\nOn June 9, 2022, ForgeRock management distributed to the ForgeRock Board a draft of ForgeRock\u2019s then-current\nbusiness plan, which had been prepared as a basis for issuing ForgeRock\u2019s guidance for the second quarter of 2022\nand subsequently updated by management, including the unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years\n2022 through 2024 (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 2022 business plan\u201d). Additional information about the\npreparation and substance of the June 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d Following the ForgeRock Board\u2019s review, management\nprovided the June 2022 business plan to representatives of J.P. Morgan for purposes of its preliminary financial\nanalysis of the May proposal.\nOn June 18, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The Strategic Committee discussed the May proposal and the\npotential landscape of other potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most likely to be interested in\npursuing a strategic transaction with ForgeRock. Mr. Rosch noted that Strategic E had previously expressed a non-\nspecific interest in acquiring ForgeRock, and had indicated in a prior discussion that it may submit a proposal in July\n2022. Strategic E never submitted such a proposal. The Strategic Committee authorized Mr. Rosch, on behalf of the\nForgeRock Board, to inform Thoma Bravo that the ForgeRock Board (1) was not interested in pursuing a transaction\nwith Thoma Bravo at $23.00 per share of ForgeRock at that time\u037e and (2) would be interested in taking the next step in\npursuing a transaction if the offer price per share were increased to an amount \u201ccloser to $30.00 than $25.00.\u201d\nOn June 19, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Rosch contacted a senior representative of Thoma Bravo\nand Mr. Rosch delivered the ForgeRock Board\u2019s message. Thoma Bravo responded that it would need to conduct\nadditional due diligence before submitting a revised proposal. Mr. Rosch informed the Strategic Committee of Thoma\nBravo\u2019s response, and the Strategic Committee authorized management to provide additional due diligence to Thoma\nBravo.\nOn June 29, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The\nStrategic Committee reviewed J.P. Morgan\u2019s relationship disclosure letter. Mr. Rosch also provided an update on\nForgeRock\u2019s anticipated results for the second quarter of 2022, including relative to ForgeRock\u2019s publicly issued\nguidance for this period (which we refer to as the \u201cQ2 2022 results\u201d). It was noted that ForgeRock would not meet\nits publicly issued guidance for annual recurring revenue for the second quarter of 2022.\nOn July 5, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The\nStrategic Committee discussed the Q2 2022 results. The representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The Strategic\nCommittee instructed management to update the June 2022 business plan in light of the Q2 2022 results and to\npresent the updated business plan to the ForgeRock Board. Representatives of management left the meeting. The\nStrategic Committee determined that it would instruct J.P. Morgan to contact Thoma Bravo to share the Q2 2022\nresults and gauge Thoma Bravo\u2019s reaction to the Q2 2022 results.\nOn July 6, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan spoke to a senior representative of Thoma Bravo regarding the Q2\n2022 results. Thoma Bravo informed J.P. Morgan that it remained interested in acquiring ForgeRock, and that Thoma\nBravo intended to submit a revised proposal following its next investment committee meeting in mid-July 2022.\nOn July 11, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an overview of Thoma Bravo\u2019s diligence over the preceding week, and\nmanagement\u2019s plan to update its June 2022 business plan based on actual results and business trends, including the\nQ2 2022 results. The Strategic Committee discussed a potential outreach process to solicit interest in a strategic\ntransaction from additional potential counterparties, including the possibility of soliciting alternative acquisition\nproposals in conjunction with Thoma Bravo\u2019s anticipated acquisition proposal and the possibility of executing such\na strategic transaction prior to ForgeRock's upcoming public announcement of its earnings results for the second\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nquarter of 2022. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed various strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most\nlikely to be interested in exploring a transaction with ForgeRock, based on such acquirors\u2019 perceived interest in\nmaking investments in the industry in which ForgeRock operates, whether they had previously expressed a credible\ninterest in acquiring ForgeRock and/or their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size. The\nStrategic Committee discussed the risks in connection with an outreach, and in particular, the risk that the Q2 2022\nresults could be leaked. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Strategic Committee\ntheir fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that an outreach process to additional\npotential acquirors (1) was unlikely to yield a counterparty that could execute a transaction before ForgeRock\u2019s\nupcoming earnings announcement\u037e (2) would consume management\u2019s time as it was preparing for its upcoming\nearnings announcement\u037e and (3) posed a substantial risk of leaks. The Strategic Committee also considered that\nshould ForgeRock enter into a transaction with Thoma Bravo in conjunction with ForgeRock\u2019s upcoming earnings\nannouncement, it expected that ForgeRock would have the ability to conduct a broad outreach process during a go-\nshop period as previously proposed by Thoma Bravo. The Strategic Committee determined that it would wait until\nThoma Bravo submitted a revised offer, and at that time, the Strategic Committee would revisit whether to initiate an\noutreach to certain counterparties.\nOn July 12, 2022, Thoma Bravo was granted access to a virtual data room hosted by ForgeRock to share due\ndiligence information.\nOn July 13, 2022, ForgeRock amended and restated the confidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo that had been\nentered into prior to ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering. As amended, the confidentiality agreement, among other\nthings, extended the term of the confidentiality restrictions and the \u201cstandstill\u201d period under the existing\nconfidentiality agreement.\nLater on July 13, 2022, members of management gave a management presentation regarding ForgeRock to Thoma\nBravo.\nOn July 14, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.\nRepresentatives of management discussed management\u2019s then-updated business plan, including the unaudited\nprospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 included in the business plan as of July 2022\n(which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 2022 business plan\u201d). Additional information about the preparation and substance of\nthe July 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information.\u201d The ForgeRock Board authorized sharing the July 2022 business plan with Thoma Bravo. The\nJuly 2022 business plan was provided to Thoma Bravo in due diligence, and also J.P. Morgan for purposes of its\nongoing financial analyses.\nOn July 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo orally informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that, following additional diligence,\nThoma Bravo maintained its initial proposed purchase price of $23.00 per share (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly\nproposal\u201d). Representatives of Thoma Bravo noted to the representatives of J.P. Morgan that they viewed the July\nproposal as an improvement to the May proposal in light of the Q2 2022 results.\nOn July 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan shared with the Strategic Committee the July proposal, and\nreviewed with the Strategic Committee the current market and industry conditions and potential responses to the July\nproposal, including (1) attempting to negotiate for a higher purchase price\u037e (2) guiding Thoma Bravo to an increased\npurchase price range\u037e or (3) terminating the discussions with Thoma Bravo altogether. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan then left the meeting. Representatives of management reviewed the Q2 2022 results and potential execution\nrisks to achieving ForgeRock\u2019s July 2022 business plan, including current market and industry conditions and\nchallenges to attracting and retaining personnel.\nLater on July 20, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and management reviewed the discussions with Thoma Bravo\nto date, and the July proposal. The Strategic Committee reviewed with the ForgeRock Board potential responses to\nthe July proposal. The ForgeRock Board considered a potential outreach process to solicit interest in a strategic\ntransaction from additional potential counterparties at that time, including the risks in connection with such an\noutreach. Representatives of management reviewed the Q2 2022 results and potential execution risks to achieving\nForgeRock\u2019s July 2022 business plan, including current market and industry conditions and challenges to attracting\nand retaining personnel.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStill later on July 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee reconvened, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and\nWilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed ForgeRock\u2019s potential responses to the July\nproposal. The Strategic Committee discussed again whether to conduct a potential outreach process to solicit\ninterest from additional potential counterparties at that time. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with\nthe members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that\nForgeRock should continue to discuss a potential transaction with Thoma Bravo, and the Strategic Committee\ninstructed J.P. Morgan to request that Thoma Bravo submit a revised acquisition proposal at an increased value. The\nStrategic Committee also determined not to conduct a broader outreach process to additional potential acquirors at\nthat time. Representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated the Strategic Committee\u2019s response to Thoma Bravo.\nOn July 26, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that Thoma Bravo had\ndetermined that it would not move forward with an acquisition of ForgeRock at that time. Among the reasons cited\nwere the uncertainty surrounding the market\u2019s reaction to ForgeRock\u2019s upcoming second quarter earnings\nannouncement and ForgeRock\u2019s then-current trading price.\nOn July 27, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed Thoma Bravo\u2019s decision to not move forward with an acquisition\nat that time. The Strategic Committee also discussed ForgeRock\u2019s upcoming earnings announcement and guidance\nfor the remainder of 2022. The Strategic Committee determined that it would suspend its review of strategic\nalternatives at that time.\nOn July 28, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch updated\nthe ForgeRock Board on the discussions with Thoma Bravo. The ForgeRock Board discussed Thoma Bravo\u2019s\ndecision not to move forward with an acquisition at that time. The ForgeRock Board determined that it would\nsuspend its review of strategic alternatives at that time. As a result, on that day, ForgeRock sent to Thoma Bravo a\nrequest to return or destroy ForgeRock confidential information in accordance with the confidentiality agreement\nwith Thoma Bravo.\nOn August 3, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Rosch to indicate interest in re-engaging in\ndiscussions with ForgeRock regarding a potential transaction at some point in the future. Later on August 3, 2022,\nMr. Rosch updated Mr. Golden on Thoma Bravo\u2019s outreach.\nOn August 11, 2022, ForgeRock announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.\nOn August 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. In light of the potential for Thoma Bravo to renew its interest in exploring an acquisition of ForgeRock,\nand based on the Strategic Committee\u2019s prior review of potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most\nlikely to be interested in exploring a transaction with ForgeRock, the Strategic Committee determined it would be\nprudent to begin conversations with those additional parties that might consider an acquisition of ForgeRock. The\nStrategic Committee directed management to work with J.P. Morgan to contact four financial sponsors, including\nSponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C, and four strategic acquirors, Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C and Strategic\nD, to solicit interest in a potential acquisition of ForgeRock, and if such counterparties decided to engage, enter into\nconfidentiality agreements, hold initial management presentations and provide due diligence to such parties.\nLater on August 26, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. Mr. Golden, on behalf of the Strategic Committee, informed the ForgeRock Board of the Strategic\nCommittee\u2019s determination to engage in a targeted outreach to certain potential counterparties. The ForgeRock Board\nagreed with the Strategic Committee\u2019s determination.\nBetween August 26, 2022 and August 28, 2022, representatives of the financial sponsors and potential strategic\nacquirors that the Strategic Committee had selected for outreach were contacted (at the request of the Strategic\nCommittee) by representatives of J.P. Morgan and/or Mr. Rosch. Of the parties contacted, Sponsor A, Sponsor B and\nSponsor C expressed an interest in pursuing discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with ForgeRock.\nThe remaining parties declined.\nOn August 31, 2022 and September 1, 2022, ForgeRock entered into confidentiality agreements with each of Sponsor\nA, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. The confidentiality agreements with each of those parties included a customary\n\u201cstandstill\u201d restriction that would terminate upon ForgeRock\u2019s entry into a definitive agreement for an acquisition of\nForgeRock.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 2, 2022, representatives of management gave management presentations regarding ForgeRock to each\nof Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Thereafter, and throughout the month of September, each of Sponsor A,\nSponsor B and Sponsor C engaged in due diligence and discussions with ForgeRock, which included multiple\nmeetings with members of ForgeRock management, members of the Strategic Committee and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan to discuss ForgeRock\u2019s business and a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn September 12, 2022, a representative of Sponsor D, on an unsolicited basis, contacted a ForgeRock director,\nexpressing a non-specific interest in meeting with representatives of management. Thereafter, the director connected\nrepresentatives of Sponsor D with Mr. Rosch, and Mr. Rosch had an introductory meeting with representatives of\nSponsor D on September 30, 2022.\nOn September 12, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with representatives of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request. The\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that Thoma Bravo desired to re-engage in discussions regarding\na potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn September 14, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. The Strategic Committee updated the ForgeRock Board on the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo,\nSponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Representatives of management reviewed management\u2019s then-updated\nbusiness plan, including the unaudited financial prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024\nincluded in the business plan as of September 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201cSeptember 2022 business plan\u201d).\nAdditional information about the preparation and substance of the September 2022 business plan is contained in the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d The ForgeRock Board\nauthorized sharing the September 2022 business plan with interested potential acquirors. The September 2022\nbusiness plan was provided to Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B in due diligence, and also J.P. Morgan for\npurposes of its ongoing financial analyses.\nOn September 15, 2022, representatives of Sponsor C informed Mr. Rosch that Sponsor C was not interested in\npursuing a strategic transaction with ForgeRock at that time.\nOn September 15, 2022, representatives of management met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to review the\nSeptember 2022 business plan and to discuss general updates to ForgeRock\u2019s business since July 2022. Thereafter,\nand until the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement, Thoma Bravo and its representatives engaged in\ndue diligence and discussions with ForgeRock, which included multiple meetings with members of ForgeRock\nmanagement, members of the Strategic Committee and representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss ForgeRock\u2019s\nbusiness and a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nLater on September 15, 2022, Sponsor A submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $23.15 per share (which we refer to as the \u201cSponsor A\nproposal\u201d).\nOn September 16, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an update on the due diligence information made available to, and\ndiscussions with, the potentially interested acquirors, including Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Mr. Rosch\nnoted that management expected that Thoma Bravo may make an updated proposal the following week.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with the Strategic Committee a preliminary financial analysis of the\nSponsor A proposal. The Strategic Committee discussed the uncertain status of Sponsor B, which had indicated it\nremained interested in pursuing a potential transaction with ForgeRock, but required additional due diligence before\nit could make a proposal. With respect to the Sponsor A proposal, the Strategic Committee authorized the\nrepresentatives of management and J.P. Morgan to inform Sponsor A that its proposal was too low for the ForgeRock\nBoard to find compelling, and to inquire what additional due diligence Sponsor A required to raise its bid. On\nSeptember 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch, together with representatives of J.P. Morgan, communicated this information to\nSponsor A.\nOn September 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $21.75 per share (which we refer to as the \u201cSeptember\nproposal\u201d). The September proposal also replaced the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision previously proposed by Thoma Bravo\nwith a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision that would restrict ForgeRock from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals after\nsigning a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma Bravo.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 20, 2022, Sponsor A was granted access to a virtual data room hosted by ForgeRock to share due\ndiligence information. On September 22, 2022, Sponsor B was granted access to the virtual data room. On September\n25, 2022, Thoma Bravo was granted renewed access to the virtual data room.\nOn September 21, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an overview of discussions with Thoma Bravo and Sponsor A, including\nthat Sponsor A had indicated it was considering the submission of a revised proposal above $24.00 per share.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and a member of the Strategic Committee reviewed similar discussions each had\nseparately had with senior representatives of Sponsor A. The Strategic Committee discussed the unsolicited\noutreach from Sponsor D. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that Sponsor D was unlikely to\nsuccessfully pursue a full acquisition of ForgeRock on an acceptable timeline. The Strategic Committee discussed\npotential execution risks to achieving ForgeRock\u2019s September 2022 business plan, including current market and\nindustry conditions and challenges to attracting and retaining personnel. The Strategic Committee instructed\nmanagement and J.P. Morgan to (1) continue to encourage Sponsor A to submit a revised proposal\u037e (2) continue to\nprovide Sponsor B with sufficient due diligence to enable it to make a proposal\u037e and (3) inform Thoma Bravo that the\nSeptember proposal was too low for the ForgeRock Board to find acceptable, and, as necessary, facilitate additional\ndue diligence in order for Thoma Bravo to submit an increased proposal.\nOn September 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Rosch met with a senior representative of Thoma\nBravo. At the meeting, Mr. Rosch informed Thoma Bravo that the September proposal was too low for the ForgeRock\nBoard to accept.\nOn September 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan met with representatives of Sponsor B. At this meeting,\nSponsor B indicated that it would need additional time to complete diligence and to decide whether it would pursue\nan acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn September 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A\nand Sponsor B. The Strategic Committee discussed the uncertainty of Sponsor B\u2019s status. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the September proposal and the Sponsor A proposal. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed certain potential execution and regulatory risks to completing a potential\ntransaction with each of Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B, and the key terms of a proposed merger agreement\nthat would be provided to such parties should the ForgeRock Board decide to proceed.\nOn September 27, 2022, Mr. Rosch gave a management presentation regarding ForgeRock to Sponsor A\u2019s investment\ncommittee.\nOn September 29, 2022 and September 30, 2022, each of Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan separately met\nwith a senior representative of Sponsor A. During each meeting, the representative of Sponsor A indicated that\nSponsor A was unable to support a proposal at or above the original Sponsor A proposal of $23.15 per share. The\nrepresentative of Sponsor A also indicated to Mr. Rosch that Sponsor A expected that any further proposal by\nSponsor A would be closer to $21.00 per share.\nOn September 29, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo. The representatives of Thoma\nBravo indicated that Thoma Bravo was (1) ready to proceed with an acquisition of ForgeRock\u037e (2) open to\nnegotiating the purchase price\u037e and (3) willing to provide an equity financing commitment for the entire aggregate\npurchase price of the acquisition (i.e., a full \u201cequity backstop\u201d). A senior representative of Thoma Bravo delivered the\nsame message to representatives of J.P. Morgan during a meeting on September 29, 2022.\nOn September 30, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A\nand Sponsor B. Mr. Rosch noted that based on the lack of urgency with which Sponsor B was moving, it was unlikely\nthat Sponsor B would make a proposal to acquire ForgeRock. The Strategic Committee also discussed the possibility\nof entering into exclusive negotiations with a potential acquiror. The Strategic Committee authorized J.P. Morgan and\nmanagement to (1) instruct each of Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B to submit \u201cfinal\u201d proposals by October\n3, 2022\u037e (2) inform the parties that ForgeRock would be willing to enter into exclusivity for a limited period with\nrespect to acquisition proposals at a purchase price of $24.00 per share of our common stock\u037e and (3) provide the\nparties an overview of ForgeRock\u2019s preliminary results of operations for the third quarter of 2022\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto support ForgeRock seeking increased acquisition proposals. Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan\nsubsequently communicated the ForgeRock Board\u2019s message regarding price and provided an overview of\nForgeRock\u2019s preliminary results of operations for the third quarter of 2022 to Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor\nB.\nOn October 1, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that Thoma Bravo had completed financial\ndue diligence and was prepared to move expeditiously to sign and announce a transaction.\nOn October 1, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to acquire\nall of the outstanding shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $23.00 per share (which we refer to as the\n\u201cfirst October proposal\u201d). The first October proposal contemplated (1) a full \u201cequity backstop\u201d of the purchase price\u037e\nand (2) that ForgeRock enter into exclusivity with Thoma Bravo through October 6, 2022.\nLater on October 1, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee instructed management and representatives of J.P. Morgan to make a\ncounterproposal for Thoma Bravo to acquire ForgeRock at a purchase price of $23.50 per share. Still later on October\n1, 2022, Mr. Rosch, together with representatives of J.P. Morgan, conveyed this counterproposal to Thoma Bravo.\nOn October 1 and October 2, 2022, each of Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan separately met with a senior\nrepresentative of Sponsor A. During each meeting, Sponsor A indicated that Sponsor A was unable to make a\nproposal at or above the original Sponsor A proposal of $23.15 per share.\nOn October 2, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our\ncommon stock for $23.25 per share. Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that this represented Thoma Bravo\u2019s \u201cbest and\nfinal\u201d offer (which we refer to as the \u201cfinal Thoma Bravo proposal\u201d). The final Thoma Bravo proposal also\ncontemplated that ForgeRock enter exclusivity with Thoma Bravo through October 6, 2022.\nLater on October 2, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee reviewed (1) the final Thoma Bravo proposal\u037e and (2) the status of\nnegotiations with each of Sponsor A and Sponsor B. Mr. Rosch noted that Sponsor B had been unresponsive to\nrequests to submit a proposal by October 3, 2022. The representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The\nrepresentatives of management reviewed potential execution risks to achieving ForgeRock\u2019s September 2022\nbusiness plan. The representatives of management then left the meeting and the Strategic Committee continued to\ndiscuss the final Thoma Bravo proposal in executive session. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with\nthe Strategic Committee members their fiduciary duties and potential execution and regulatory risks to completing a\ntransaction with Thoma Bravo. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee to enter into exclusive negotiations\nwith Thoma Bravo based on the final Thoma Bravo proposal. In making its determination, the Strategic Committee\nconsidered, among other things, (1) the fact that Sponsor A was not prepared to submit a revised proposal at or\nabove the original Sponsor A proposal\u037e (2) the uncertainty around Sponsor B's status, and the low likelihood that\nSponsor B would submit any acquisition proposal, let alone a proposal that the ForgeRock Board would consider\nattractive\u037e (3) the outreach that ForgeRock had conducted to other potential acquirors\u037e (4) ForgeRock\u2019s prospects as\na stand-alone company\u037e (5) certain potential benefits and risks to completing a transaction with Thoma Bravo\u037e and (6)\nthe uncertainty in the debt financing markets, and Thoma Bravo\u2019s commitment to provide a full \u201cequity backstop\u201d for\nthe purchase price. Representatives of management and J.P. Morgan rejoined the meeting. The Strategic Committee\ndirected management to work with Wilson Sonsini and J.P. Morgan to negotiate the terms of the draft merger\nagreement, with the objective of reaching a potential definitive agreement for an acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma\nBravo during the exclusivity period. The Strategic Committee reviewed the material terms of a proposed engagement\nletter with J.P. Morgan to memorialize the terms of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement as financial advisor to ForgeRock, and\napproved ForgeRock\u2019s entry into such engagement letter on the terms discussed.\nStill later on October 2, 2022, ForgeRock entered into exclusivity with Thoma Bravo until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on\nOctober 6, 2022. Thereafter, ForgeRock provided a draft merger agreement to Thoma Bravo as prepared by Wilson\nSonsini. The draft merger agreement provided for a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent in the event the\nmerger agreement was terminated in certain circumstances at a time when the applicable regulatory approvals\nrequired to complete the merger had not been obtained.\nStill later on October 2, 2022, ForgeRock entered into an engagement letter with J.P. Morgan with respect to J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s engagement as financial advisor to ForgeRock.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFollowing delivery of the draft merger agreement, representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (which\nwe refer to as \u201cKirkland & Ellis\u201d), legal counsel to Thoma Bravo, met regularly to negotiate the terms of the merger\nagreement. The principal areas of negotiation in the merger agreement included (1) the respective efforts required by\nForgeRock and Parent to obtain the required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the merger\u037e (2) the\ninclusion of a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent and the terms on which it might be payable\u037e (3) the\n\u201ctermination date\u201d of the merger agreement and the extensions thereto\u037e (4) the restrictions on ForgeRock\u2019s operation\nof the business prior to the completion of the merger (i.e., the \u201cinterim operating covenants\u201d), including with respect\nto employee and compensation matters\u037e and (5) the conditions to each party\u2019s obligations to close the merger. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis also negotiated the terms of the limited guaranty and the\nequity commitment letter. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Kirkland & Ellis and certain of ForgeRock\u2019s\ndirectors and their affiliated investment funds, together with their representatives, also negotiated the terms of the\nvoting agreements.\nFollowing delivery of the draft merger agreement, Messrs. Rosch and Fernandez met on numerous occasions with\nsenior representatives of Thoma Bravo to negotiate the interim operating covenants of the merger agreement.\nOn October 6, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. Messrs. Rosch and Golden reviewed the status of negotiations of the draft merger agreement with\nThoma Bravo, and the discussions with Sponsor A and Sponsor B prior to entering into exclusivity with Thoma\nBravo. The representatives of J.P. Morgan then joined the meeting and reviewed and discussed J.P. Morgan\u2019s\npreliminary financial analysis of the final Thoma Bravo proposal based on the September 2022 business plan. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties and then discussed the key terms\nof the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter. Mr. Rosch confirmed to the ForgeRock Board that neither\nhe nor, to his knowledge, any other member of management had engaged in any discussions with Thoma Bravo\nconcerning any \u201crollover\u201d of any equity stake in ForgeRock in connection with a potential acquisition, or the\npossibility of employment following an acquisition, or the potential terms thereof. The representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand management left the meeting and the ForgeRock Board continued in executive session. The ForgeRock Board\nunanimously approved continuing to pursue a transaction with Thoma Bravo and authorized management to grant\nThoma Bravo one-day exclusivity extensions through October 9, 2022. The ForgeRock Board instructed the\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini to continue to negotiate for the inclusion in the merger agreement of a regulatory\ntermination fee payable by Parent.\nOn October 7, 2022, ForgeRock extended exclusivity with Thoma Bravo until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on October 7,\n2022.\nOn October 8, 2022, Mr. Rosch, and Messrs. Golden and Welsh, on behalf of the Strategic Committee, met with senior\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo to negotiate the regulatory provisions in the merger agreement, including the\npotential inclusion of a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent.\nOn October 9, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the open points in the merger agreement. The Strategic Committee\ndetermined that ForgeRock would accept not including a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent, and seek to\nfinalize the other remaining provisions of the merger agreement.\nOn October 9, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. Mr. Golden summarized the status of negotiations with Thoma Bravo with respect to the regulatory\nprovisions, the interim operating covenants and other terms of the draft merger agreement, noting the Strategic\nCommittee\u2019s recommendation that the ForgeRock Board proceed without a regulatory termination fee payable by\nParent in the merger agreement. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the ForgeRock\nBoard their fiduciary duties. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed and discussed J.P. Morgan\u2019s financial\nanalysis of the consideration to be paid by Thoma Bravo in the merger, noting that J.P. Morgan was prepared to\nrender its opinion that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, limitations,\nqualifications and other factors that would be set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to be\npaid to the holders of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of\nview, to such holders. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the remaining key terms of the merger\nagreement and the equity commitment letter. The ForgeRock Board authorized the representatives of management, J.P.\nMorgan and Wilson Sonsini to finalize negotiation of the merger agreement with Thoma Bravo, under the supervision\nof the Strategic Committee and consistent with the terms presented to the ForgeRock Board.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn October 10, 2022, the merger agreement, equity commitment letter, limited guaranty, voting agreements and other\ntransaction documents were finalized.\nLater on October 10, 2022, the representatives of J.P. Morgan delivered, together with a copy of the financial analysis\nreviewed and discussed by J.P. Morgan with the ForgeRock Board on October 9, 2022, J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion\nto the ForgeRock Board, dated October 10, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions, limitations, qualifications and other factors set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in\ncash to be paid to the holders of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders.\nOn the evening of October 10, 2022, the members of the ForgeRock Board, by unanimous written consent: (1)\ndetermined that the merger agreement and the transactions, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best\ninterests of ForgeRock and our stockholders\u037e (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by\nForgeRock, the performance by ForgeRock of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation\nof the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein\u037e (3) recommended that the stockholders\nof ForgeRock adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby\u037e and (4) directed that\nthe adoption of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of ForgeRock at a meeting\nthereof.\nOvernight on October 10, 2022, ForgeRock and Thoma Bravo executed the merger agreement and delivered the\nexecuted voting agreements, equity commitment letter and limited guaranty. After execution of the transaction\nagreements, ForgeRock and Thoma Bravo issued a joint press release announcing the entry into the merger\nagreement before the opening of trading on NYSE on October 11, 2022.\nOn November 30, 2022, a representative of Strategic E notified a representative of management that Strategic E was\nconsidering making a proposal to acquire ForgeRock. As of the date of this proxy statement, ForgeRock has not\nreceived any further communications from Strategic E.\nRecommendation of the ForgeRock Board and Reasons for the Merger",

            "text": "Recommendation of the ForgeRock Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the ForgeRock Board\nOn October 10, 2022, the ForgeRock Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement and the\ntransactions, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ForgeRock and its stockholders\u037e\n(2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by ForgeRock, the performance by ForgeRock of its\ncovenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the\nconditions set forth therein\u037e (3) recommended that the stockholders of ForgeRock adopt the merger agreement and\napprove the transactions contemplated thereby\u037e and (4) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be\nsubmitted for consideration by the stockholders of ForgeRock at a meeting thereof.\nThe ForgeRock Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or\ndates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger\nagreement at the time of the special meeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the ForgeRock Board consulted with ForgeRock management, as\nwell as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and J.P. Morgan. In recommending that ForgeRock stockholders\nvote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement, the ForgeRock Board considered and analyzed a number of\nfactors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based\non these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the ForgeRock Board\nconcluded that entering into the merger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ForgeRock and\nour stockholders.\nThe ForgeRock Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and\nrecommendation:\n\u2022\nBusiness, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The ForgeRock Board considered the\ncurrent and historical and financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive positioning\n43TABLE OF CONTENTS\nof ForgeRock, as well as ForgeRock\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In\nparticular, the ForgeRock Board considered management\u2019s then current business plan, including the\nSeptember 2022 business plan. Additional information about the preparation and substance of the\nSeptember 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information.\u201d The ForgeRock Board considered these plans and the potential\nopportunities that they presented against, among other various execution and other risks to achieving\nmanagement\u2019s business plan and related uncertainties, including (1) the likelihood that management\u2019s\nbusiness plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short and long term,\nincluding the ability to maintain management\u2019s growth targets\u037e (2) the impact of market, customer and\ncompetitive trends on ForgeRock\u037e and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to market\nconditions that could reduce the price of our Class A common stock. Among the potential risks identified\nby the ForgeRock Board were:\n\u25cb\nForgeRock\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among\nthese risks were consideration of (1) ForgeRock\u2019s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to\nthose of its competitors\u037e (2) new and evolving competitive threats\u037e (3) challenges to acquiring new\ncustomers or retaining our existing customers\u037e (4) challenges to attracting and retaining personnel\u037e\nand (5) other factors affecting the revenues, operating costs and profitability of companies in\nForgeRock\u2019s industry generally and other risk factors described in ForgeRock\u2019s other filings with the\nSEC, as listed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d\n\u25cb\nThe current market and industry conditions, including international, national and local economic\nconditions, the current environment in the enterprise identity security industry, the likely effect of\nthese factors on ForgeRock and the execution of ForgeRock\u2019s plans as a standalone public company,\nand the possibility that market and industry conditions-for ForgeRock and the larger economy- will\nnot improve and could get worse.\n\u25cb\nThe challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded\ncompany, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance. The ForgeRock Board was\naware that the price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted if ForgeRock failed to\nmeet investor expectations, including if ForgeRock failed to meet its growth objectives.\n\u25cb\nThe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of ForgeRock\u2019s\nClass A common stock.\n\u2022\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic review\nprocess overseen by the Strategic Committee. The ForgeRock Board considered that, at ForgeRock\u2019s\ndirection, representatives of J.P. Morgan, together with representatives of ForgeRock management and the\nForgeRock Board, affirmatively contacted four potential strategic acquirers and four financial sponsors (in\naddition to Thoma Bravo) concerning their interest in an acquisition of ForgeRock. The ForgeRock Board\nconsidered the nature of the engagement by each of these potential acquirers over several weeks and that,\nof these potential acquirers, only Sponsor A made a proposal for an acquisition of ForgeRock, which was\nultimately lower than the per share merger consideration.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the\nmerger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business\nand financial execution risks of management\u2019s business plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates\nuncertainty and risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of ForgeRock\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the ForgeRock Board that the per share merger\nconsideration represents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of our common stock, taking\ninto account the ForgeRock Board\u2019s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy,\nassets, liabilities and general financial condition of ForgeRock on a historical and prospective basis. In\naddition, the ForgeRock Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks described\nabove, the per share merger consideration reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common\nstock. The ForgeRock Board also considered that the per share merger consideration constitutes (1) a\npremium of approximately 53% over ForgeRock\u2019s closing share price on October 10, 2022, the last full\ntrading day prior to the transaction announcement, and (2) a premium of approximately 44% over the\nvolume weighted average price of ForgeRock stock for the 30 days ending October 10, 2022.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the ForgeRock Board that none of the possible\nalternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate ForgeRock as an independent\ncompany or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives,\nas well as the potential benefits and risks to ForgeRock\u2019s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing\nand likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us\nto create greater value for our stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business,\ncompetitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nFairness Opinion of J.P. Morgan. The written opinion of J.P. Morgan delivered to the ForgeRock Board,\ndated October 10, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and other factors set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to\nbe paid to the holders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\u201d and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B\nto this proxy statement.\n\u2022\nNegotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement, which\nwas the product of arms\u2019-length negotiations, and the belief of the ForgeRock Board that the merger\nagreement contained terms that provided ForgeRock with a high level of closing certainty. The factors\nconsidered included:\n\u25cb\nForgeRock\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations\nwith, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.\n\u25cb\nThe ForgeRock Board\u2019s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third\nparties from making a superior proposal.\n\u25cb\nThe ForgeRock Board\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its\nrecommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.\n\u25cb\nForgeRock\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an\nalternative acquisition agreement. In that regard, the ForgeRock Board believed that the termination\nfee payable by ForgeRock in such instance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees\npayable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.\n\u25cb\nThe limited conditions to Parent\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger reasonably\nlikely to be consummated.\n\u25cb\nForgeRock\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement and the equity\ncommitment letter, to specifically enforce Parent\u2019s obligation to cause the equity financing to be\nfunded as contemplated by the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter.\n\u25cb\nThe fact that Thoma Bravo agreed to provide a full equity backstop for the full purchase price.\n\u2022\nBusiness Reputation of Thoma Bravo. The ForgeRock Board believed that the business reputation and\nfinancial resources of Thoma Bravo were factors that supported the conclusion that a transaction with\nParent (which is owned by Thoma Bravo) could be completed quickly and in an orderly manner, and had a\nsubstantial likelihood of being consummated successfully.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to our stockholders\n(including beneficial owners of shares of our common stock) who timely and properly exercise such\nappraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.\nThe ForgeRock Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors,\nincluding the following:\n\u2022\nRegulatory Risks. The possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to or challenge the merger or\nmay seek to impose terms and conditions on their approvals that are not acceptable to Parent. In this\nregard, the ForgeRock Board considered the provisions of the merger agreement related to obtaining the\nregulatory\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\napprovals required to complete the merger, including that the merger agreement did not provide for a\nregulatory termination fee payable by Parent in the event the merger agreement was terminated in certain\ncircumstances at a time when the applicable required regulatory approvals required to complete the merger\nhad not been obtained.\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash\ntransaction means that our stockholders will not participate in ForgeRock\u2019s future earnings or growth and\nwill not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation following the merger, whether as\nan independent company or in combination with other Thoma Bravo portfolio companies or assets. The\nForgeRock Board also considered the other potential alternative strategies available to ForgeRock as an\nindependent company, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential to result in a more\nsuccessful and valuable company.\n\u2022\nNo-Shop Restrictions. The restrictions in the merger agreement on ForgeRock\u2019s ability to solicit competing\nproposals from the date of the merger agreement (subject to certain exceptions to allow the ForgeRock\nBoard to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior proposal, and then only upon the payment of\na termination fee).\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be\nconsummated, and if it is not consummated, that: (1) ForgeRock\u2019s directors, senior management and other\nemployees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions\nfrom their work on behalf of ForgeRock during the pendency of the merger\u037e (2) ForgeRock will have\nincurred significant transaction and other costs\u037e (3) ForgeRock\u2019s continuing business relationships with\ncustomers, business partners and employees may be adversely affected\u037e (4) the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock could be adversely affected\u037e (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to\nForgeRock in the event of the termination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or\nboth\u037e and (6) the failure of the merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among our\ncustomers, potential customers, employees and investors, which could cause an adverse impact on our\noperating results.\n\u2022\nParent Liability Limitation. The fact that Parent\u2019s liabilities for monetary damages payable for breaches\nunder the merger agreement, limited guaranty or equity commitment letter are limited to $140.0 million.\n\u2022\nImpact of Interim Restrictions on ForgeRock\u2019s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The\nrestrictions on our conduct of ForgeRock\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may\ndelay or prevent us from undertaking strategic initiatives before the completion of the merger that, absent\nthe merger agreement, ForgeRock might have pursued.\n\u2022\nEffects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger, including the:\n(1) effects on ForgeRock\u2019s employees, customers, operating results and stock price\u037e (2) impact on\nForgeRock\u2019s ability to attract and retain management, sales and marketing and technical personnel\u037e and (3)\npotential for litigation in connection with the merger.\n\u2022\nTermination Fee Payable by ForgeRock. The requirement that ForgeRock pay Parent a termination fee of\n$60.0 million under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if the\nForgeRock Board terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. The ForgeRock Board\nconsidered the potentially dampening effect that this termination fee could have on a third party\u2019s interest\nin making a proposal to acquire ForgeRock.\n\u2022\nTaxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock in the merger will\nbe a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for many ForgeRock stockholders.\n\u2022\nInterests of ForgeRock\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers. Interests that ForgeRock\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers may have in the merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of our other\nstockholders.\nThis discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors evaluated by the\nForgeRock Board in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the ForgeRock Board\nconcluded that the potential benefits of entering into the merger agreement outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In\nlight of the variety of factors considered by the ForgeRock Board and the complexity of these factors, the\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nForgeRock Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the\nforegoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the ForgeRock\nBoard applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different relative\nweights to the different factors. The ForgeRock Board adopted and approved the merger agreement and the merger,\nand recommended that ForgeRock stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the totality of the\ninformation presented to, and considered by, the ForgeRock Board. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set\nforth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of J.P.

            "text": "Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nPursuant to an engagement letter, ForgeRock retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the\nproposed merger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger. ForgeRock decided to\nengage J.P. Morgan due to, among other things, J.P. Morgan\u2019s familiarity with ForgeRock due to J.P. Morgan\u2019s role as\na lead book-running manager in ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering, as well as J.P. Morgan\u2019s qualifications, extensive\nexpertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which ForgeRock operates and experience in\nadvising similar companies in connection with potential strategic transactions.\nAt the meeting of the ForgeRock Board on October 9, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan presented J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nfinancial analysis of the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock in the merger to the ForgeRock\nBoard and informed the ForgeRock Board that J.P. Morgan was prepared to render its oral opinion to the ForgeRock\nBoard that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, limitations, qualifications and\nother factors to be set forth in its written opinion, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to be paid to the\nholders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders. On October 10, 2022, J.P. Morgan delivered its written opinion to the ForgeRock Board, dated October 10,\n2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, limitations, qualifications and\nother factors set forth in its opinion, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to be paid to the holders of our\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated October 10, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. ForgeRock\u2019s stockholders are urged\nto read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the ForgeRock Board (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed merger, was directed only\nto the consideration to be paid in the merger and did not address any other aspect of the merger. The issuance of J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a\nrecommendation to any stockholder of ForgeRock as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the\nproposed merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft dated October 10, 2022 of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning ForgeRock and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of ForgeRock with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of our Class A common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of ForgeRock\nrelating to its business\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\n47TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of ForgeRock with respect to\ncertain aspects of the merger, and the past and current business operations of ForgeRock, the financial condition and\nfuture prospects and operations of ForgeRock, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or\nappropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by ForgeRock or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,\npursuant to J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement letter with ForgeRock, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake\nany such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal\nof any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of ForgeRock, Parent or Merger Sub under any\napplicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts\nprovided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on\nassumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future\nresults of operations and financial condition of ForgeRock to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan\nexpressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also\nassumed that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated as\ndescribed in the merger agreement, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect\nfrom the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties\nmade by ForgeRock and Parent in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct\nin all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments\nmade by advisors to ForgeRock with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material\ngovernmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be\nobtained without any adverse effect on ForgeRock or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock in the proposed merger, and J.P. Morgan has\nexpressed no opinion as to (1) the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the merger to the\nholders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of ForgeRock, (2) the allocation of the\naggregate merger consideration to be paid to all holders of our common stock between the holders of our Class A\ncommon stock and our Class B common stock, or the relative fairness of the consideration to the holders of any\nshares of our common stock or (3) the underlying decision by ForgeRock to engage in the merger. J.P. Morgan also\ndid not express any opinion as to the voting rights associated with the our Class B common stock or any governance\nor other rights of the holders thereof (and did not take any such rights into account in their analysis). Furthermore,\nJ.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers,\ndirectors, or employees of any party to the proposed merger, or any class of such persons relative to the\nconsideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock in the proposed merger or with respect to the fairness of\nany such compensation. \nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the ForgeRock Board on October 10, 2022 and contained in the presentation\ndelivered to the ForgeRock Board on October 9, 2022 in anticipation of, and in connection with, the rendering of such\nopinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan in connection with\nrendering such opinion and contained in such presentation, and does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.\nConsidering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view\nof J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of ForgeRock with similar data for\nselected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to ForgeRock.\nThe companies selected by J.P. Morgan (which we refer to as the \u201cSelected Companies\u201d) were:\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nKnowBe4, Inc.\n\u2022\nTenable Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022\nRapid7, Inc.\n\u2022\nOkta, Inc.\n\u2022\nElastic N.V.\n\u2022\nVaronis Systems, Inc.\n\u2022\nCyberArk Software Ltd.\nThe Selected Companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses\nthat, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of\nForgeRock and/or one or more of its businesses. The Selected Companies may be considered similar to ForgeRock or\nsuch businesses based on the nature of their assets and operations\u037e however, none of the companies selected is\nidentical or directly comparable to ForgeRock or such businesses, and certain of these companies may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different from those of ForgeRock or such businesses. J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses\nnecessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational\ncharacteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they\nwould affect ForgeRock or such businesses.\nUsing information obtained from the Selected Companies\u2019 public filings and FactSet Research Systems as of October\n7, 2022, J.P. Morgan calculated for each Selected Company the ratio of such company\u2019s firm value (calculated as the\nmarket value of the company\u2019s common stock on a fully diluted basis, plus any debt, less cash and cash equivalents)\nto the equity research analyst estimate for such company\u2019s projected revenue in 2023, calendarized based on a\nDecember 31 fiscal year end (which we refer to as the \u201cFV/2023E Revenue\u201d).\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 4.00x to 7.00x for FV / 2023E\nRevenue.\nJ.P. Morgan applied this range to ForgeRock\u2019s estimated revenue for the 2023 fiscal year based on the September 2022\nbusiness plan, together with extrapolations of such unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025\nthrough 2032 prepared by ForgeRock management (as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) to derive a range of firm values for ForgeRock, which was\nthen adjusted to take into account ForgeRock\u2019s net debt totaling $(307.0 million) in the aggregate as of June 30, 2022,\nto derive a range of implied equity values for ForgeRock. The analysis indicated the following range of implied per\nshare equity value for our common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05:\n \nImplied Per Share \nEquity Value \n(rounded to the \nnearest $0.05)\n \nLow\nHigh\nFV/2023E Revenue\n$14.50\n$22.70\nThe range of implied per share equity value was compared to (1) the closing price per share of our Class A common\nstock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022, and (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share of our common stock.\nSelected Transaction Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan reviewed selected transactions (which we refer to as the \u201cSelected\nTransactions\u201d) involving businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis and based on its experience and\nprofessional judgment, were considered by J.P. Morgan to be similar to ForgeRock\u2019s business. Specifically, J.P.\nMorgan reviewed the Selected Transactions set forth in the below table.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor each of the Selected Transactions, J.P. Morgan calculated the firm value implied by the consideration to be paid\nfor the target company in such transaction as a multiple of published equity research analyst estimates for the target\ncompany\u2019s projected revenue for the 12-month period following the announcement of the applicable transaction\n(which we refer to as the \u201cFV/NTM Revenue\u201d). The following table sets forth each of the Selected Transactions\nreviewed by J.P. Morgan:\nTarget\nAcquiror\nMonth/Year Announced\nAvalara, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\nAugust 2022\nPing Identity Holding Corp.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nAugust 2022\nZendesk, Inc.\nHellman & Friedman LLC\nJune 2022\nDatto, Inc.\nKaseya Limited\nApril 2022\nSailPoint Technologies, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nApril 2022\nAnaplan, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nMarch 2022\nMandiant, Inc.\nGoogle LLC\nMarch 2022\nMedallia, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nJuly 2021\nTalend S.A.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nMarch 2021\nPluralsight, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\nDecember 2020\nInstructure, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nFebruary 2020\nForescout Technologies, Inc.\nAdvent International Corporation\nFebruary 2020\nSophos Group plc\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nOctober 2019\nCarbon Black, Inc.\nVMware, Inc.\nAugust 2019\nPivotal Software, Inc.\nVMware, Inc.\nAugust 2019\nMedidata Solutions, Inc.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes SE\nJune 2019\nMINDBODY, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\nDecember 2018\nApptio, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\nNovember 2018\nRed Hat, Inc.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\nOctober 2018\nSendGrid, Inc.\nTwilio Inc.\nOctober 2018\nCallidus Software Inc.\nSAP America, Inc.\nJanuary 2018\nAconex Limited\nOracle Corporation\nDecember 2017\nXactly Corporation\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\nMay 2017\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 6.0x to 10.0x for FV/NTM\nRevenue and applied it to ForgeRock\u2019s projected revenue for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, to derive a range of\nfirm values for ForgeRock, which was then adjusted to take into account ForgeRock\u2019s net debt totaling $(307.0\nmillion) in the aggregate as of June 30, 2022, to derive a range of implied equity values for ForgeRock. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values per share of our common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05, of $18.15 to\n$27.80, which was compared to (1) the closing price per share of our Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7,\n2022, and (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share of our common stock.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity\nvalue per share for our common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using\nestimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value\nof money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their \u201cpresent value.\u201d The \u201cunlevered free cash\nflows,\u201d for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated\nby an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current\nvalue of the future cash flows generated by the asset, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the\npresent using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the cost of\ncapital and other appropriate factors. \u201cTerminal value\u201d refers to the present value of all future cash flows generated\nby the asset for periods beyond the projections period.\nJ.P. Morgan calculated the present value of the future standalone unlevered after-tax free cash flows for fiscal year\n2023 through fiscal year 2032 (which we refer to as the \u201cDCF Projection Period\u201d) based upon the September 2022\nbusiness plan and the September 2022 extrapolations. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nForgeRock by applying a range of perpetuity growth rates, as provided by management of ForgeRock, ranging from\n4.0% to 5.0% of the unlevered free cash flows of ForgeRock during the final year of the DCF Projection Period. The\nunlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted from December 31 of each year to\npresent values as of December 31, 2022 using a mid-year convention and a range of discount rates from 10.00% to\n12.00%. The discount rate range was selected by J.P. Morgan based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the weighted\naverage cost of capital for ForgeRock.\nBased on the foregoing, these analyses indicated a range of implied equity values per share of our common stock,\nrounded to the nearest $0.05, of $18.30 to $31.00. The range of implied equity values per share of our common stock\nwere compared to (1) the closing price per share of Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022, and (2) the\nmerger consideration of $23.25 per share of common stock.\nOther Information\n52-Week Historical Trading Range.\nFor reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the trading range for the\nClass A common stock for the 52-week period ended October 7, 2022, which was $11.94 per share to $36.00 per share,\nand compared that range to (1) the closing price per share of Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022,\nand (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share of our common stock.\nAnalyst Price Targets. \nFor reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the publicly available equity\nresearch analyst price target range for the Class A common stock as of October 7, 2022, and noted that such price\ntarget range was $17.00 per share to $26.00 per share, and compared that price target range to (1) the closing price per\nshare of Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022, and (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share\nof our common stock.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan does not purport to be a\ncomplete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a\ncomplex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes\nthat the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the\nforegoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete\nview of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from\nany particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference\nfor analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of\nForgeRock. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses\nor factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or\nnegative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the Selected\nCompanies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to ForgeRock, and none of the Selected\nTransactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are\npublicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to those of ForgeRock. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants,\nsize and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The analyses\nnecessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational\ncharacteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to ForgeRock\nand the transactions compared to the merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise ForgeRock with respect to the\nmerger and deliver an opinion to the ForgeRock Board with respect to the merger on the basis of, among other things,\nsuch experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with\nForgeRock and the industries in which it operates.\nJ.P. Morgan received a fee from ForgeRock of $3.0 million for delivery of its opinion. ForgeRock has agreed to pay J.P.\nMorgan a transaction fee equal to 1.30% of the merger consideration upon the closing of the transaction, against\nwhich the opinion fee will be credited. In addition, ForgeRock has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable,\ndocumented and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its services, including travel costs and the\nreasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out\nof J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its\naffiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with ForgeRock and certain portfolio companies\nof Thoma Bravo for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services\nduring such period have included (1) acting as joint lead bookrunner on ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering in October\n2021 and (2) providing debt syndication, equity underwriting and financial advisory services to portfolio companies\nof Thoma Bravo unrelated to the merger. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a\nlender under outstanding credit facilities of portfolio companies of Thoma Bravo, for which it receives customary\ncompensation or other financial benefits. During the two year period preceding the delivery of its opinion ending on\nOctober 10, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from ForgeRock were approximately $6.0 million and\nfrom affiliates of Thoma Bravo were approximately $105.0 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P.\nMorgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of ForgeRock, Parent and Thoma Bravo and its portfolio companies for\ntheir own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short\npositions in such securities or other financial instruments.",

The tables below summarizes the (1) unaudited prospective financial\ninformation for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 included in our business plan as reviewed with the ForgeRock Board in\nJune 2022, which financial information is referred to as the \u201cJune 2022 business plan,\u201d (2) unaudited prospective\nfinancial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 included in our business plan as updated by ForgeRock\nmanagement as of, and reviewed with the ForgeRock Board in, July, 2022, which financial information is referred to as\nthe \u201cJuly 2022 business plan\u201d and (3) unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024\nincluded in our business plan as updated by ForgeRock management as of, and reviewed with the ForgeRock Board\nin, September, 2022, which financial information is referred to as the \u201cSeptember 2022 business plan,\u201d together with\nextrapolations of such unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025 through 2032 prepared by\nForgeRock management for use by J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses for the purpose of rendering\nan opinion to the ForgeRock Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to\nthe holders of our common stock (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-\nOpinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\u201d), which extrapolations are referred to as the \u201cSeptember 2 0 2 2\nextrapolations.\u201d For purposes of this proxy statement, we refer to the June 2022 business plan, the July 2022\nbusiness plan, the September 2022 business plan and the September 2022 extrapolations, collectively, as the\n\u201cunaudited prospective financial information.\u201d The unaudited prospective financial information was\n52TABLE OF CONTENTS\nprepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided by ForgeRock management to the\nStrategic Committee and the ForgeRock Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger\nand strategic alternatives thereto. At the direction of the ForgeRock Board, the September 2022 business plan and the\nSeptember 2022 extrapolations were also provided to, and approved for use by, J.P. Morgan for purposes of\nperforming its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the ForgeRock Board as to the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock (as more fully\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\u201d). In addition,\ncertain of the unaudited prospective financial information was provided to Thoma Bravo prior to the execution of the\nmerger agreement, and to certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving\nForgeRock, as part of discussions and to assist in their respective due diligence review during ForgeRock\u2019s outreach\nprocess to solicit interest regarding a potential strategic transaction. For more information on the preparation and use\nof the unaudited prospective financial information, please see the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-\nBackground of the Merger\u201d and \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.\u201d\nThe unaudited prospective financial information was developed by ForgeRock management as then-current estimates\nof our future financial performance as an independent company, without giving effect to the merger, including any\nimpact of the negotiation or execution of the merger agreement or the merger, the expenses that have already and will\nbe incurred in connection with completing the merger, or any changes to ForgeRock\u2019s operations or strategy that may\nbe implemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the merger. The unaudited\nprospective financial information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed\u037e it\nshould not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe unaudited prospective financial information constitutes forward-looking statements. The unaudited prospective\nfinancial information is not included in this proxy statement to influence any decision on whether to vote for the\nmerger proposal or any other proposal presented at the special meeting, but rather is included in this proxy statement\nto give stockholders access to certain non-public information that was provided to the Strategic Committee, the\nForgeRock Board and ForgeRock\u2019s financial advisor for the purposes described above, as well as to Thoma Bravo\nand certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving ForgeRock. By including the\nunaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement, none of ForgeRock, J.P. Morgan or any person\nhas made or makes any representation to any person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the\ninformation contained in the unaudited prospective financial information. The inclusion of the unaudited prospective\nfinancial information should not be regarded as an indication that the ForgeRock Board, the Strategic Committee,\nForgeRock, ForgeRock\u2019s management or J.P. Morgan or any other person considered, or now considers, them to be\nnecessarily predictive of actual future results, and they should not be relied on as such. Further, the inclusion of the\nunaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or\nrepresentation by ForgeRock that the information presented is material. There can be no assurance that the\nprospective results will be realized or that actual results of ForgeRock will not be materially lower or higher than\nestimated. The unaudited prospective financial information has not been updated or revised to reflect information or\nresults either as of or after the date of this proxy statement. ForgeRock may report results of operations for periods\nincluded in the unaudited prospective financial information that were or will be completed following the preparation\nof the unaudited prospective financial information. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to ForgeRock\u2019s\nperiodic filings with the SEC for information on ForgeRock\u2019s actual historical results.\nThe unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, the unaudited\nprospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the\nSEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or\npresentation of prospective financial information. The unaudited prospective financial information included in this\nproxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, ForgeRock\u2019s management. ForgeRock\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled\nnor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial information and,\naccordingly, they do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young\nLLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates solely to ForgeRock\u2019s previously issued financial\nstatements. It does not extend to the unaudited prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.\nAlthough the unaudited prospective financial information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous\nassumptions and estimates as to future events made by ForgeRock management that ForgeRock management\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbelieved in good faith were reasonable at the time the unaudited prospective financial information was prepared,\nincluding with respect to growth rates\u037e market share\u037e market size and conditions\u037e products and product mix\u037e contract\nduration expansion\u037e renewal rates\u037e annualized recurring revenue\u037e operating expenses\u037e margins\u037e and net working\ncapital. ForgeRock\u2019s ability to achieve the financial results contemplated by the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation will be affected by our ability to achieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable\nperiods, and will be subject to operational and execution risks associated therewith. The unaudited prospective\nfinancial information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important\nfactors that may affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved\ninclude, among others, (1) general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital, credit,\nsecurities and foreign exchange markets\u037e (2) our ability to continue and effectively manage our growth\u037e (3) our ability\nto continue to innovate in response to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and changing\ncustomer needs, requirements or preferences\u037e (4) compliance with laws and regulations relevant to ForgeRock\u2019s\nbusiness, many of which are evolving\u037e (5) competitive pressures in the identity security industry, especially from\nlarger, well-established companies\u037e (6) our ability to efficiently acquire new customers, retain our existing customers\nor expand the level of adoption of our platform with our existing customers\u037e (7) our ability to attract, integrate and\nretain qualified personnel\u037e and (8) our relationships with our partners, including the software or services from third\nparties used in our business. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be found in the various risk\nfactors included in our periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are\noutside of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the unaudited prospective financial information\nwill be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the unaudited\nprospective financial information. For information on factors that may cause our future results to materially vary, see\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d The unaudited prospective financial\ninformation may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts. You should evaluate the unaudited\nprospective financial information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical financial statements and other\ninformation regarding ForgeRock contained in our public filings with the SEC. The unaudited prospective financial\ninformation may not be consistent with ForgeRock\u2019s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions detailed\nabove. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise\nrevise the unaudited prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such\ninformation was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events.\nBecause the unaudited prospective financial information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to\nsensitivities and assumptions, as well as to multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business\ndevelopments. The unaudited prospective financial information also covers multiple years, and such information by\nits nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The unaudited prospective financial information is not,\nand should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the unaudited prospective\nfinancial information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results or\nfor purposes of making any investment decision.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the unaudited prospective financial information are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures (which we refer to as the \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d). These are financial performance measures that\nare not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used\nby other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they\nexclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Please refer to our other filings with the SEC for additional information on how we calculate\nnon-GAAP financial measures, including ARR (annualized recurring revenue). Financial measures included in\nforecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination\ntransaction, such as the unaudited prospective financial information, are excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would\notherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of\nnon-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Strategic Committee, the ForgeRock Board,\nJ.P. Morgan, or any other person. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the unaudited\nprospective financial information is provided in this proxy statement.\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table presents a summary of the June 2022 business plan.

STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FULL TEXT OF SECTION 262 AS\nWELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. \n61TABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock or beneficial owners\nwho (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of our common stock to ForgeRock prior\nto the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) do not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the adoption\nof the merger agreement\u037e (3) continuously hold of record or beneficially own such shares on the date of making the\ndemand for appraisal through the effective time of the merger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and\nsatisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of our common\nstock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of the consideration set\nforth in the merger agreement, for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of\nthe judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the amount determined to be\nthe fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to each person entitled to appraisal\nprior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described further below. However, after an appraisal\npetition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights,\nwill dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares of a class or series of stock that, immediately prior to the\nclosing of the merger, were listed on a national securities exchange who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless (A) the total number of shares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or\nperfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in accordance with\nsubsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1\nmillion. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Given that the shares of our Class A common\nstock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the\nmerger), then the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of our Class A\ncommon stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is satisfied.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on the\namount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and compound quarterly from the\neffective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount\nrate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before\nthe entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person\nentitled to appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount\nso paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash\npayment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record\ndate for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or\ninformation directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be\naccessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes ForgeRock\u2019s notice to our stockholders that\nappraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is available at the\nfollowing URL: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the merger, any\nholder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such\nholder\u2019s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of\nSection 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who\nloses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement\nwithout interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising\nthe right to seek appraisal of shares of our common stock, ForgeRock believes that if a person is considering\nexercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common\nstock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nsuch person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch person must deliver to ForgeRock a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger\nagreement at the special meeting\u037e\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsuch person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of our common stock from the\ndate of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a person will lose appraisal rights if the\nperson transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger)\u037e and\n\u2022\nsuch person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding\na determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of\nthe merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of\ndoing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine\npersons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who asserted appraisal rights\nwith respect to the shares of our Class A common stock unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote\nagainst the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.\nFiling Written Demand\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to ForgeRock, before the vote on the adoption of the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s shares. In addition, that\nperson must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the Internet or\ntelephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any\npreviously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising appraisal rights must hold, beneficially or of\nrecord, the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares through\nthe effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless\nrevoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the\nstockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a\nstockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing\ninstructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the\nmerger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing\nto vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal\nsatisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from\nany proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger\nagreement will not constitute a demand. A person\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote\non the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nIn the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably inform\nForgeRock of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand must\nreasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made, be accompanied by documentary\nevidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of such stock and a statement that such documentary\nevidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner\nconsents to receive notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the Verified List (as defined\nbelow).\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nForgeRock, Inc.\n201 Mission Street, Suite 2900\nSan Francisco, California 94105\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and accept\nthe per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding\ntaxes, by delivering to ForgeRock, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to\nany person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon\nsuch terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(which we refer to as a \u201cReservation\u201d) for any Application (as defined below)\u037e provided, however, that this shall not\naffect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named\nparty to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the\neffective time of the merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal\nproceeding with respect to a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such\nappraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered\npursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify\neach stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly made a written\ndemand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger\nagreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any person who\nhas complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving\ncorporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not\nassume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of\nthe shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any persons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate\nall necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock within the time and\nin the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262\ncould nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for an\nappraisal of such person\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nsurviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement and with respect to which ForgeRock has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that where a beneficial owner\nmakes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate\nstockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate number). Such statement must be given within ten\ndays after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the\nexpiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy\nthereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such service\nto file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing\nthe names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as\nto the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time\nand place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the persons shown on\nthe Verified List at the addresses stated therein. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.\nAfter notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the hearing on\nsuch petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with Section 262 and\nwho have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons\nwho demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock certificates to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any\nperson fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nperson. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Verified List may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGiven that the shares Class A common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (and assuming such shares\nremain so listed up until closing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal\nproceedings as to all holders of shares of our Class A common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to our Class A\ncommon stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking\nappraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be\npaid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of\npayment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date\nof the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time\nprior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to\neach person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection\n(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount paid\nby the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in\nan appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the\ndate of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair\nvalue is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In\nCede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that]\ndoes not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value\narising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that\n\u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the\ndate of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive\npursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm\nas to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and\nmay not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. ALTHOUGH FORGEROCK BELIEVES THAT THE\nPER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF\nFAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD\nRECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN APPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR\nLOWER THAN, OR THE SAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither ForgeRock nor Parent anticipates offering\nmore than the per share price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of ForgeRock and Parent reserves\nthe rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of our common stock is less than the per\nshare price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to our Class A common stock, if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an\nappraisal will cease.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any,\nby the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such person upon such\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nterms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be\nenforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts)\nmay be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the Verified List who\nparticipated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith (which we refer to as an \u201cApplication\u201d),\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the\nshares entitled to an appraisal that were not dismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award\npursuant to a Reservation. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect,\nor loses or validly withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of our common stock will be\ndeemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share price as\nprovided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if\nno petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership\nthresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our\nClass A common stock, or if the person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance\nwith Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with\nSection 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of\ndividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of\nrecord at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an\nappraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been\nsatisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our Class A common stock, or if\nsuch person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s demand for an appraisal and\nan acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, then the right of such person to an\nappraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nbe dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such\nterms as the Court deems just, including, without limitation, a Reservation\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing\nshall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as\na named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger\nwithin 60 days after the effective date of the merger.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of appraisal rights.\nIn that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the\nmerger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person wishing to\nexercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\nAccounting Treatment",

This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n(which we refer to, as amended, the \u201cCode\u201d), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions,\npublished positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable\nauthorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing\ninterpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.

Further, no opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered with\nrespect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME\nTAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) has a valid election\nin effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is\nneither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares\nsurrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.\nHolder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A\nreduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder\n(including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different\nblocks of shares of our common stock at different times and/or different prices, such holder must determine its\nadjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.\nSubject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain realized\nby a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained\nby such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,\nsuch gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable\nincome tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case\nsuch gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable\nincome tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nForgeRock is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in\nSection 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five-year\nperiod preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable shares\nof our common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant period\u201d) and, if shares of our common stock are\nregularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code),\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of our common\nstock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the\nbranch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real\nproperty interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its\nworldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this\npurpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land, improvements\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we\nare not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-\nU.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to\nthem if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a\nholder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS\nForm W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-\nU.S. Holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b)\notherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. Holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S. federal\nincome tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the\nmerger.\nAdditional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued\nthereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, \u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain\npayments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution\nenters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the\nU.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which include\ncertain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with\nU.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain\npayments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification\nidentifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental\nagreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under\ncertain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would\neliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common\nstock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may\ngenerally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible\nimplications of FATCA on the disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL\nINFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH U.S. HOLDER AND NON-U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT SUCH\nHOLDER\u2019S OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RULES DISCUSSED ABOVE\nTO SUCH HOLDER AND THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION\nAND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.",

Following informal discussions with the DOJ, Parent notified the FTC and the\nDOJ that it had elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 of the HSR\nAct in order to allow the DOJ additional time to review the transaction. Parent\u2019s notification and report form was\nwithdrawn effective as of November 23, 2022, and Parent refiled the notification and report form on November 28,\n2022, at which time a new 30-day waiting commenced period under the HSR Act. Both before and after the expiration\nof the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust\ngrounds.\nAdditionally, under the merger agreement, the merger also cannot be completed until Parent submits the filings under\ncertain specified FDI laws and all necessary consents, approvals, and filings have been obtained or made, and/or all\nwaiting periods (including any extensions thereof) (including any timing agreements with applicable governmental\nauthorities) with respect to the consummation of the merger have expired or otherwise have been terminated under\nthe jurisdictions in which those FDI filings were submitted. Parent, in coordination and consultation with ForgeRock,\nsubmitted the specified FDI filings on October 31, 2022.\nForgeRock and Parent have each agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to (1) supply the other (or cause\nthe other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC,\nthe DOJ or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing, including FDI\nfilings, are made\u037e and (2) take all action necessary to, as soon as practicable, cause the expiration or termination of the\napplicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act applicable to the merger or receive approval or clearance for any\nFDI filing.\nAdditionally, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging or by acquiring\nin any other manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business\ncompetes in any material line of business with ForgeRock or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive\nagreement relating to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) impose any material\ndelay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order,\ndeclaration or approval of any governmental authority necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or\ntermination of any applicable waiting period\u037e (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering\nan order preventing or materially restraining the consummation of the merger\u037e (3) materially increase the risk of not\nbeing able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise\u037e or (4) materially delay or prevent the consummation of\nthe merger, subject to certain exceptions.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable,\nincluding seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or\nrequiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At\nany time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action\ncould include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of\nForgeRock or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances.\nSubject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the extent necessary\nto obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws or FDI laws applicable to the\nmerger, offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (1) the sale,\ndivestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold separate (thorough the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any\nand all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,\nproperties, products of business of Parent, ForgeRock and their respective subsidiaries\u037e (2) the termination,\nmodification, or assignment of existing relationships, joint ventures, contracts, or obligations of Parent, ForgeRock,\nand their respective subsidiaries\u037e (3) the modification of any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent,\nForgeRock, and their respective subsidiaries\u037e and (4) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent, ForgeRock and\ntheir respective subsidiaries\u037e in each case, so as to allow the consummation of the merger as soon as practicable and\nin any event at least three business days prior to the termination date\u037e provided that Parent and Merger Sub need\nnot, and ForgeRock agreed not to, without the prior written consent of Parent, commit to or effect any action (A) with\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrespect to the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,\nproperties, products or businesses of affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub or (B) that, individually or in the aggregate,\nwould, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material adverse effect to the business, financial condition or\nresults of operations of Parent, ForgeRock, and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole.\nParent agreed to oppose any request for the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment,\ndecree, injunction or ruling of any governmental authority that would restrain, prevent, or delay any required\nconsents, clearances, approvals, waivers, actions, waiting period expirations or termination, non-actions or other\nauthorizations applicable to the merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted by any person\nin any court or before any governmental authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing\nproperly any adverse decision or order by any governmental authority. In the event the merger agreement is\nterminated under the scenarios described in the third and fourth bullets of the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement,\u201d Parent has agreed to reimburse\nForgeRock for the reasonable and documented advisor costs and expenses of all such actions, including responding\nto any requests for information in connection with any filing made under the antitrust laws, up to an aggregate\namount of $7.5 million.\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it\ngrants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory\nprocess or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even\npreclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain\nall of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the\nmerger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the\nconditions to the merger not being satisfied.\nLimited Guarantee",

            "text": "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger\nagreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger\nagreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not\ncontain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the\nparties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other\ninformation contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from\nthose generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by\nconfidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by ForgeRock in connection with the merger agreement.\nIn addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of\nallocating contractual risk between ForgeRock and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as\nfacts. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.\nOur stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of ForgeRock, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the\nmerger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the\nmerger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the\nrespective businesses of ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are\neither expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to\nby the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding ForgeRock, Parent, Merger Sub or\ntheir respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the\nmerger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this\ndocument and in our filings with the SEC regarding ForgeRock and our business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub and ForgeRock that is no\nlater than (a) if the last condition to the closing of the merger to be satisfied or waived is related to (i) waiting periods\nor required consents under the HSR Act, (ii) the absence of any order issued by any governmental authority of\ncompetent jurisdiction or any law that, in each case, prevents, materially restrains or materially impairs the\nconsummation of the merger or (iii) requisite consents, approvals and filings under certain specified FDI laws, the\nfifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions\u037e (b) if the last condition to the closing of the\nmerger to be satisfied or waived is any condition except for the ones mentioned in clause (a) above, the third\nbusiness day after the satisfaction or waiver of such condition (in each case, other than those conditions that by\ntheir terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such\nconditions)\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the\nmerger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided\nunder the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a\nlater time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.",

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) of the consideration to be paid\nto such holders in the proposed merger (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nProject Fortress Parent, LLC (the \u201cAcquiror\u201d). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cAgreement\u201d),\namong the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Project Fortress Merger Sub, Inc. (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), the\nCompany will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common\nStock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any\ndirect or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror or Merger Sub, and Dissenting Company Shares (as\ndefined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $23.25 per share in cash (the \u201cConsideration\u201d).\nIn connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated October 10, 2022 of the Agreement\u037e (ii)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in\nwhich it operates\u037e (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial\nterms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available\ninformation concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market\nprices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e (v)\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its\nbusiness\u037e and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.\nIn addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or\nappropriate to our inquiry.\nIn giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We\nhave not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our\nengagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\nhave we evaluated the solvency of the Company, the Acquiror or Merger Sub under any state or federal laws relating\nto bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived\ntherefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and\nfinancial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that\nthe definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also\nassumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the\nrelated agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nor tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We\nhave further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the\nconsummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the\ncontemplated benefits of the Transaction.\nOur opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion\nand that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock\nin the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to (i) the fairness of any consideration to be paid in\nconnection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of\nthe Company, (ii) the allocation of the aggregate Consideration to be paid to all holders of Company Common Stock\nbetween the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, or the relative fairness of the\nConsideration to the holders of any shares of the Company Common Stock, or (iii) the underlying decision by the\nCompany to engage in the Transaction. We also do not express any opinion as to the voting rights associated with\nthe Class B Common Stock or any governance or other rights of the holders thereof (and have not taken any such\nrights into account in our analysis). Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any\ncompensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons\nrelative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the Transaction or with\nrespect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee\nfrom the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed\nTransaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of\nour engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or\ninvestment banking relationships with the Company and certain portfolio companies of Thoma Bravo, L.P. (an affiliate\nof the Acquiror) (\u201cTB\u201d), for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services\nduring such period have included (i) acting as joint lead bookrunner on the Company\u2019s initial public offering in\nOctober 2021 and (ii) providing debt syndication, equity underwriting and financial advisory services to portfolio\ncompanies of TB unrelated to the Transaction. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a\nlender under outstanding credit facilities of portfolio companies of TB, for which it receives customary compensation\nor other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the\noutstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we\nand our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,\nbank loans or other obligations) of the Company, the Acquiror or TB and its portfolio companies for our own account\nor for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities\nor other financial instruments.\nOn the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid\nto the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders.\nThe issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This\nletter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the\npurposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder\nof the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.

To the extent that\n(A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund\u037e (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes\nfor any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by\nSection 2.7\u037e or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment\nA-20TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAgent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, then\nParent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange\nFund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level\nsufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income\nfrom investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.\n(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.\n(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within one Business\nDay), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented\noutstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company\nShares) (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the\nconsideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which\nwill specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of\nthe Certificates to the Payment Agent (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11))\u037e and (B)\ninstructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect\nthereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a\nCertificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and\nvalidly executed, in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be\nentitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the\nPayment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash (less any\napplicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the\naggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price.\nThe Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with\nsuch reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in\naccordance with customary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of\nCertificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so\nsurrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the\nconsideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.\n(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of\nshares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the \u201cUncertificated Shares\u201d) will not be required to\ndeliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in\nrespect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective\nTime) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of\nCompany Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of\nCompany Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof\npursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d in customary form (it being understood that the\nholders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an\n\u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d or such other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective\nTime, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable)\nan amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained\nby multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder\u2019s\ntransferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price. The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be\ncancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable\nterms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with\ncustomary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of Uncertificated\nShares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii).\nUntil so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the\nright to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.\n(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish\nprocedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.,\nEastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date\nan amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)\nthe number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company\nA-21\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nShares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price\n(such amount, the \u201cDTC Payment\u201d)\u037e and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date,\nthen the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the\nClosing Date.\n(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not\nregistered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name\nother than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock\ntransfer books or ledger of the Company, then the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be\npaid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the\nstock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper\nform for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated\nby Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the\nregistered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)\nthat such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with\nrespect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are\nregistered.\n(f) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment\nAgent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount\nproperly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any\nCertificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in\nrespect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any\nGovernmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent\npermitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person\npreviously entitled thereto.\n(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains\nundistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective\nTime will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were\nissued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred\ntheir Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange\npursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of\nCompany Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to\nabandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price\nto which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.",
