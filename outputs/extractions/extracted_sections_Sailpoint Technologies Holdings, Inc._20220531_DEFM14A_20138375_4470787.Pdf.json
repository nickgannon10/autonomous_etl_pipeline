If you attend the Special Meeting and complete a virtual ballot, your\nvote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.\n14Table of Contents\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the\nvoting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the\nproposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may\nnot vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive in respect of my shares of SailPoint common stock if the Merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration of $65.25 in cash, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, for each share of SailPoint common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal\nrights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of SailPoint common stock, you will receive $6,525.00 in cash in exchange for your\nshares of SailPoint common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nWhat will the holders of outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs receive if the Merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger:\nEach Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into\nthe right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share\nMerger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint common\nstock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to any required withholding of taxes.\nEach Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the\ncontingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per\nShare Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint\ncommon stock underlying such Unvested Company Option. Subject to the holder\u2019s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the\nSurviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts will vest\nand become payable at the same time as the Company Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would\nhave vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and\nconditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the\nUnvested Company Option Consideration.\nEach Vested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into\nthe right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of SailPoint\ncommon stock underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of taxes.\nEach Unvested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the\ncontingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of\nSailPoint common stock underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. Subject to the holder\u2019s continued service with\nParent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company\nRSU Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Company RSU from which such Unvested Company RSU\nConsideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain\nsubject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company\n15\nTable of Contents\nRSU immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company RSU Consideration.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any SailPoint Stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (ii) grant a proxy\nover the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card)\u037e or (iii) vote in person by virtual ballot at the Special\nMeeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d\nand a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will\nhave the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Each \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the\nSpecial Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the\nSpecial Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares\nrepresented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR,\u201d on an advisory (non-\nbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional\nproxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a quorum?\nA:\nThe holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting as of the record date must be\npresent at the Special Meeting in order to hold the Special Meeting and conduct business. This presence is called a quorum. Your shares are\ncounted as present at the Special Meeting if you are present and vote in person at the Special Meeting or if you have properly submitted a proxy.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by SailPoint Stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, SailPoint Stockholders\nwill not receive any payment for their shares of SailPoint common stock. Instead, SailPoint will remain an independent public company, SailPoint\ncommon stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic\nreports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, SailPoint will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of either $212,540,000 or $81,750,000, upon the termination\nof the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014\nTermination Fee.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy are SailPoint Stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require SailPoint to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments\nthat could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\n16\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nIf a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of voting power of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special\nMeeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of the Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if SailPoint Stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is\nan advisory vote and will not be binding on SailPoint. Therefore, if the other requisite SailPoint Stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger\nis completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to SailPoint\u2019s named executive officers in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger\nAgreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other\nthings, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that\nyour shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the\nvoting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, SailPoint\nStockholders of record who do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their\nshares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware if the merger is completed. Appraisal rights will only be available to\nSailPoint Stockholders who properly deliver, and do not properly withdraw, a written demand for an appraisal to SailPoint prior to the vote on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of\nthe DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a SailPoint\nStockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to\nthis proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights.\u201d\nQ:\nShould I surrender my book-entry shares now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the paying agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and written instructions that explain how\nto exchange shares of SailPoint common stock represented by such holder\u2019s book-entry shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of SailPoint common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you\nsell or transfer your shares of SailPoint common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as\nprovision of a proxy) are\n17\nTable of Contents\nmade between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies SailPoint in writing of such special\narrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell\nor transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares\nof SailPoint common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a SailPoint Stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (\u201cAST\u201d), you are\nconsidered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cSailPoint Stockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have\nbeen sent directly to you by SailPoint.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of SailPoint common stock\nheld in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with\nrespect to those shares, to be the SailPoint Stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other\nnominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because\nyou are not the SailPoint Stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d\nfrom your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of SailPoint common stock are registered in your name with AST, our transfer\nagent), there are four (4) ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of SailPoint common stock, and\nto confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote\nelectronically over the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each\ncase, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of SailPoint common stock by proxy. If\nyou are a record holder or if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of SailPoint\ncommon stock in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special\nMeeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by\ncompleting and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee, electronically\n18\nTable of Contents\nover the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the\ninstructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special\nMeeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you\nvoted against adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special\nMeeting by:\n\u2022\nsigning another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy\u037e\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of SailPoint\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.\nIf you hold your shares of SailPoint common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions\nregarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or\nother nominee.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of SailPoint common stock. The written document describing the matters to\nbe considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of\nSailPoint common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d Mark D. McClain, our director and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Schmitt, our Executive Vice\nPresident, General Counsel and Secretary, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of substitution and re-substitution.\nQ:\nIf a SailPoint Stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way\nthat you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for\nor against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by\nyour properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR,\u201d on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the\nCompensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.\n19\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials?\nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed\nproxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.\nYou may receive more than one (1) set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting\ninstruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one (1) brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card\nfor each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one\n(1) name, you will receive more than one (1) proxy card.\nQ:\nWho will count the votes?\nA:\nThe inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the Special Meeting. The inspector of\nelections will also determine whether a quorum is present.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nSailPoint intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports\nthat SailPoint files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of SailPoint common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?\nA:\nThe exchange of SailPoint common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAccordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nthe Merger\u201d) who exchanges shares of SailPoint common stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If\nyou are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nthe Merger\u201d), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have certain connections with the United States, but\nmay be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax unless you comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish a valid exemption\nfrom U.S. backup withholding tax.\nFor a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022.\nHowever, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted, because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the\nMerger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nThe expenses of soliciting proxies will be paid by SailPoint. SailPoint has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in soliciting proxies for a\nfee of up to $75,000, plus costs and expenses. SailPoint\n20\nTable of Contents\nand its agents may solicit proxies by mail, electronic mail, telephone, facsimile, by other similar means, or in person. Our directors, officers, and other\nemployees, without additional compensation, and employees of Innisfree M&A Incorporated may solicit proxies personally or in writing, by\ntelephone, email, or otherwise. SailPoint will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders to forward copies of the soliciting\nmaterials to persons for whom they hold shares and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, SailPoint, upon the request of\nthe record holders, will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses. If you choose to access the proxy materials through the internet, you\nare responsible for any internet access charges you may incur.\nQ:\nWhat if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the virtual meeting website?\nA:\nSailPoint will have technicians ready to assist you with any technical difficulties you may have accessing the virtual meeting website. If you\nencounter any difficulties accessing the Special Meeting during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting, please call the technical support\nnumber that will be posted on the Special Meeting log-in page.\nQ:\nDo any of SailPoint\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ from those of SailPoint Stockholders\ngenerally?\nA:\nYes.

Due to the complexity of the\nappraisal process, SailPoint Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to\nseek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to SailPoint before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement\u037e (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continue to hold your shares of\nSailPoint common stock of record through the Effective Time\u037e and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under\nSection 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal\nrights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions\nare satisfied by SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights,\u201d which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant\nsection of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and\nincorporated herein by reference. If you hold your shares of SailPoint common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to\nexercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a\ndemand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee.\nDelisting and Deregistration of SailPoint Common Stock",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of SailPoint\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board and SailPoint\u2019s management periodically\nreview, consider and assess SailPoint\u2019s operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic\ngoals and plans. This review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions\nand other financial and strategic alternatives.\nFrom SailPoint\u2019s initial public offering in November 2017 until August 2018, Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates reported holding a controlling stake in\nSailPoint. By the end of 2018, Thoma Bravo beneficially owned less than 5% of SailPoint\u2019s outstanding common stock.\nIn April 2020, SailPoint management commenced a review of the Company\u2019s strategic direction for its products and SaaS services to expand beyond\ntraditional identity governance and, in the third quarter of 2020, SailPoint\n32Table of Contents\nengaged a nationally recognized consulting firm to validate and review its strategic direction to drive growth. As part of the review, the consulting firm\nassessed target segment opportunities for a possible buyside acquisition strategy by SailPoint. As part of that engagement, the consulting firm identified\nseveral priority areas for possible inorganic expansion, including data governance, machine identities, and cloud identity.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, SailPoint management requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the Company\u2019s financial capacity to undertake acquisitions,\nincluding large-scale acquisitions. In October 2021, Morgan Stanley discussed with the Board the valuation environment and observations for SailPoint\nto consider with respect to potential large-scale acquisitions, including the challenges associated with executing potential large-scale transactions with\ndata governance (DG) companies as a result of limitations associated with the Company\u2019s financial and leverage capacity at its then-current market\ncapitalization. For a number of reasons, including significant volatility in SailPoint\u2019s trading price during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 as well as\nthe then-prevailing valuations of potential target companies, the Board and Company management believed during the second half of 2021 that it was not\nviable at that time to pursue a DG company acquisition or other large-scale acquisition.\nIn early December 2021, in the context of the Company\u2019s continuing review of the strategic direction for its products and SaaS services, management\ndetermined that it would be sensible to approach Thoma Bravo for outside input on SailPoint\u2019s Identity Security vision as a longtime former investor in\nthe Company and one that is highly knowledgeable about SailPoint and the infrastructure software and cybersecurity sectors generally. Prior to meeting\nwith Thoma Bravo, management consulted with members of the Board about this determination. On December 7, 2021, members of Company management\nmet with representatives of Thoma Bravo and discussed with them the Company\u2019s Identity Security vision, challenges and market environment and\nopportunity. Company management did not solicit, intend to solicit or expect any indication of interest from Thoma Bravo to undertake any strategic\ntransaction or partnership with the Company.\nOn December 10, 2021, Thoma Bravo representatives called Mr. Mark McClain, CEO of SailPoint. On the call, they expressed interest in exploring a\npotential strategic transaction between SailPoint and Thoma Bravo and requested that Thoma Bravo be permitted to enter into a non-disclosure\nagreement to commence due diligence in connection with such exploration of a potential transaction. Mr. McClain stated to the Thoma Bravo\nrepresentatives that he would need to discuss this request with the Board. Mr. McClain did not comment on any such potential transaction with Thoma\nBravo and made no commitment to permit Thoma Bravo to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. Following the call, Mr. McClain and other members of\nCompany management gave an update regarding the call to Mr. William Bock, chairperson of the Board, who directed Company management to reach out\nto outside counsel and schedule a Board meeting to discuss Thoma Bravo\u2019s unsolicited outreach.\nOn December 13, 2021, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McMartin to inquire whether he could discuss due diligence requests. Mr. McMartin\nreiterated to the Thoma Bravo representative that he was not authorized to have any such discussion and that he would need to discuss the request with\nthe Board.\nOn December 14, 2021, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McClain to request an update. Mr. McClain stated that a Board meeting had been\nscheduled and that he expected that he would have a response to Thoma Bravo\u2019s request following the meeting.\nOn December 14, 2021, the Board met by videoconference to discuss the unsolicited outreach by Thoma Bravo to Mr. McClain. Members of SailPoint\nmanagement also attended the meeting. The Board requested a meeting to understand from outside counsel its advice regarding the Board\u2019s fiduciary\nduties with respect to inbound interest in a potential strategic transaction and related matters before making a decision on whether and how to respond to\nThoma Bravo\u2019s unsolicited outreach. The Board also directed Company management to convey to Thoma Bravo that the Board was considering a\nresponse to Thoma Bravo\u2019s unsolicited outreach and possible next steps, if any, and to request that Thoma Bravo await the outcome of that evaluation.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOn December 16, 2021, at the direction of the Board as discussed above, Mr. McClain called a Thoma Bravo representative and conveyed that the Board\nwas considering a response to Thoma Bravo\u2019s unsolicited outreach and possible next steps, if any, and requested that Thoma Bravo await the outcome of\nthat evaluation. The Thoma Bravo representative responded that Thoma Bravo would wait as requested.\nOn December 17, 2021, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and, at the direction of Mr. Bock as described above,\nrepresentatives of Goodwin Procter LLP, SailPoint\u2019s outside counsel (\u201cGoodwin\u201d), also attended the meeting. Representatives of Goodwin discussed\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties in this context in connection with the evaluation of a potential strategic transaction involving SailPoint, whether with Thoma\nBravo or any other counterparty, including that under Delaware law, the Board could \u201cjust say no\u201d to offers for a potential transaction, even if compelling.\nThe Board also discussed disclosure of relationships between directors and Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates to the other directors. The Board discussed\npotentially establishing a special committee at the appropriate time, should the Board consider engaging with Thoma Bravo on a potential transaction, in\nlight of potential conflicts of interest or potential appearances of conflicts of interest arising from relationships with Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates.\nFurthermore, the Board discussed that Company management should not discuss with Thoma Bravo the involvement, compensation or equity\nparticipation of Company management in the business from and after the consummation of any potential transaction, and throughout the process leading\nup to the execution of the Merger Agreement, no such discussion was held between Company management and Thoma Bravo. At the meeting, the Board\nand its advisors also discussed the importance of understanding the Company\u2019s current long-range plan and projections, the current value of the\nCompany and available strategic opportunities before determining how to respond to Thoma Bravo\u2019s outreach. Accordingly, the Board then authorized\nSailPoint management to develop a set of long-range plans and projections to fiscal year 2026, expanding on the three-year plan that SailPoint\nmanagement had been developing at the time on a standalone basis. The Board also requested that, in the meantime, management continue to\nconfidentially consider and evaluate various strategic opportunities, including but not limited to potential acquisitions of DG companies by SailPoint.\nIn accordance with the direction of the Board, SailPoint management then proceeded to develop a set of long-range plans and projections, including the\nrelated methodology, underlying assumptions and related risks and preliminary financial forecasts for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. After management\u2019s\ncompletion of this draft, on January 6, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also\nattended the meeting. Members of SailPoint management led a discussion of this draft. Following discussion, the Board requested that Company\nmanagement incorporate additional cash flow analyses into this draft. At the January 6, 2022 meeting, the Board and management also continued to\ndiscuss various strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions by the Company, execution risks facing the Company and the Company\u2019s go-to-\nmarket strategy and account acquisition metrics.\nOn January 10, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management led a discussion about the draft long-range plans and\nprojections presented at the Board\u2019s January 6, 2022 meeting, as updated to incorporate additional cash flow analyses as requested by the Board at that\nmeeting (as so updated, the \u201cJanuary 2022 Projections\u201d). Following discussion, the Board approved the January 2022 Projections for use by Morgan\nStanley to prepare a preliminary financial analysis of the Company and present to the Board strategic alternatives reasonably available to the Company.\nThe Board also discussed the formal engagement of Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction, noting\nSailPoint\u2019s longstanding relationship with Morgan Stanley, including Morgan Stanley\u2019s work with SailPoint in connection with SailPoint\u2019s ongoing\nstrategic review, as well as Morgan Stanley\u2019s extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which SailPoint operates and experience advising software\ncompanies in connection with potential strategic transactions (including but not limited to advising companies that had previously been approached by\nThoma Bravo). On the basis of these considerations, and subject in all respects to the Board\u2019s review of a customary relationships disclosure to be\nproduced by Morgan Stanley, the Board authorized SailPoint to engage Morgan Stanley, and, as described below, following negotiations over the terms\nof the engagement between the Special Committee (as defined below) and Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley was formally engaged on March 18, 2022\neffective as of January 10, 2022.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOn January 13, 2022, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McClain seeking an update on whether the Company had a response yet to Thoma Bravo\u2019s\nrequest to enter into a non-disclosure agreement and to begin discussions on a potential strategic transaction. Mr. McClain stated to the Thoma Bravo\nrepresentative that he was not authorized to have any such discussion and that he would need to discuss the request with the Board.\nLater on January 13, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management also attended the meeting and representatives of\nGoodwin and Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. Morgan Stanley gave a comprehensive presentation on (i) market and industry\ndynamics, (ii) SailPoint\u2019s trading performance since its initial public offering, (iii) M&A activity in the software and technology industries, (iv) Thoma\nBravo\u2019s acquisition and bidding history, and (v) Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the universe of other potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors of\nthe Company. Morgan Stanley then presented its preliminary financial analysis of the Company based on the January 2022 Projections and the Board\ndiscussed this financial analysis. Following discussion, the Board instructed Morgan Stanley to respond to Thoma Bravo (i) stating that the Company\nwas not for sale, (ii) stating that, at a minimum, the Board believes that full year 2021 and fourth quarter 2021 financial results must first be released before\nthe Board was prepared to even consider a potential transaction, and (iii) conveying to Thoma Bravo that, in light of the strength of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness and the fact that Company was not for sale, any premium in any proposal must exceed traditional M&A market premiums prevailing in the\nindustry.\nOn January 20, 2022, Morgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and conveyed the Board\u2019s message described in clause (iii) above. On the call, Thoma Bravo\nconveyed that Thoma Bravo would be prepared to focus on a premium to the intrinsic value of the Company, rather than on a premium to recent trading\nprice, which may result in a significant premium to the then-current trading price. Following this call, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McClain\nand such representative confirmed that Thoma Bravo would await a determination of the Board on next steps, if any, but reiterated a desire to be able to\nstart due diligence, which Mr. McClain reiterated is a decision reserved for the Board. Later that day, Mr. McClain gave an update to the Board on the\nexchanges between Thoma Bravo and Morgan Stanley and himself which occurred on that day. The Board reiterated that full year 2021 and fourth quarter\n2021 financial results must first be released before the Board was prepared to even consider a potential transaction. As a result, the Board determined (i)\nnot to permit Thoma Bravo to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the Company, (ii) not to permit Thoma Bravo access to due diligence, (iii) not to\notherwise engage further with Thoma Bravo and (iv) for Company management to continue to operate the Company as an independent, publicly traded\ncompany, while continuing to consider and evaluate various strategic opportunities, including but not limited to potential acquisitions by SailPoint.\nMorgan Stanley conveyed this determination to Thoma Bravo on January 20, 2022.\nOn February 28, 2022, SailPoint issued its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results, announcing significant year-over-year increases in total\nannual recurring revenue, total revenue and subscription revenue, as well as its guidance for 2022. SailPoint\u2019s trading price increased 14% in the\nsubsequent two trading days.\nOn March 1, 2022, Mr. McClain received a call from a representative of Thoma Bravo. On the call, the Thoma Bravo representative conveyed that it would\nsoon submit a non-binding letter of intent to acquire the Company. On the same day, Morgan Stanley also received a call from a representative of Thoma\nBravo who conveyed substantially the same message. On these calls, Mr. McClain and Morgan Stanley each conveyed to Thoma Bravo that it was\nThoma Bravo\u2019s prerogative to submit a non-binding letter of intent and therefore the Company would not try to stop Thoma Bravo from doing so.\nLater on March 2, 2022, SailPoint received an unsolicited non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo to acquire SailPoint for $60.00 per share in cash\n(the \u201cMarch 2 Proposal\u201d). The $60.00 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint\u2019s last closing price prior to March 2, 2022 of approximately 34%.\nThe March 2 Proposal also noted that (i) the full consideration would be financed with a combination of equity from Thoma Bravo funds and debt from\none or more of Thoma Bravo\u2019s lending partners, (ii) the transaction would not be subject to any financing contingencies, (iii) Thoma Bravo envisioned a\n\u201c30-day closed go-shop\u201d and (iv) Thoma Bravo was\n35\nTable of Contents\nmaking certain assumptions underlying its offer price, including as to the Company\u2019s cash position and the dilutive effect of the Company\u2019s equity\nawards and convertible notes, and that the Company\u2019s unvested dilutive securities would be paid out in cash from and after closing in accordance with\ntheir existing vesting schedules (clauses (i) through (iv) collectively, the \u201cSpecified Non-Binding Terms\u201d). The March 2 Proposal was promptly shared\nwith the Board.\nOn March 7, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also\nattended the meeting. Goodwin provided an overview of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in connection with their evaluation of a potential transaction.\nMorgan Stanley provided market, trading price and industry updates since the last such presentation on January 13, 2022, noting in particular the impacts\nof inflation, the interest rate environment, global supply chain challenges, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and higher energy prices, among other\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics that had newly arisen or been exacerbated since the January 13, 2022 presentation. The Board then discussed\nthe March 2 Proposal. Morgan Stanley presented an updated preliminary financial analysis based on Thoma Bravo\u2019s $60.00 per share offer price and on\nthe January 2022 Projections, Company management confirmed that the January 2022 Projections had not materially changed since their approval. A\nrepresentative of Goodwin discussed certain process considerations with respect to a possible transaction with Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates or with\nother entities, including the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest with members of the Board. The Board discussed various potential\nconflicts of interest or potential appearances of a conflict of interest applicable to each director (if any) in relation to (i) a potential transaction with Thoma\nBravo and (ii) Thoma Bravo and its affiliates. Specifically, it was noted that (i) Mr. McClain had investments in various funds affiliated with Thoma Bravo\nwhich were not material to his overall net worth and not material to Thoma Bravo and its affiliates\u037e (ii) Mr. Cam McMartin served as the audit committee\nchair of a Thoma Bravo portfolio company\u037e (iii) Mr. William Bock served as a director of two Thoma Bravo portfolio companies\u037e (iv) Mr. Jim Pflaging\nserved as a director of four Thoma Bravo portfolio companies\u037e (v) Mr. Sudhakar Ramakrishna served as the CEO and director of a Thoma Bravo portfolio\ncompany\u037e (vi) Ms. Tracey Newell had no known potential conflicts of interest or potential appearances of a conflict of interest\u037e (vii) Ms. Heidi Melin had\nno known potential conflicts of interest or potential appearances of a conflict of interest\u037e (viii) Mr. Ron Green had no known potential conflicts of interest\nor potential appearances of a conflict of interest\u037e and (ix) Mr. Mike Sullivan had been appointed to the Board as an independent director by Thoma Bravo\nat a time when Thoma Bravo was the controlling stockholder of the Company, but otherwise had no known potential conflicts of interest or potential\nappearances of a conflict of interest. Following discussion, the Board adopted resolutions forming a special committee of the Board (the \u201cSpecial\nCommittee\u201d or \u201cCommittee\u201d), consisting of directors who are independent and disinterested in relation to (i) a potential transaction with Thoma Bravo\nand (ii) Thoma Bravo and its affiliates, to consider and evaluate any proposals made for a potential transaction with any counterparty as well as any\nalternatives to a potential transaction, including, without limitation, the Company continuing to operate as an independent, publicly traded company. The\nBoard appointed Ms. Newell, Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Melin to the Special Committee (with these directors recusing themselves from the vote with respect\nto certain resolutions concerning their compensation as members of the Committee). Prior to this meeting, Ms. Newell, Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Melin had\neach answered questions regarding their relationships, which confirmed that each was independent and disinterested in relation to (i) a potential\ntransaction with Thoma Bravo and (ii) Thoma Bravo and its affiliates. The Board determined to revisit the composition of the Special Committee in the\nevent that the Company engaged with any other counterparty with respect to which any of the incumbent members of the Special Committee were not\nindependent or disinterested.\nImmediately following the Board meeting on March 7, 2022, the Special Committee held its first meeting by videoconference. Members of SailPoint\nmanagement and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. The Committee discussed views on valuation of the\nCompany and risks to the Company on a standalone basis. Following the discussion, the Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to prepare potential\nalternative responses to Thoma Bravo\u2019s $60.00 per share offer price.\n36\nTable of Contents\nAlso on March 7, 2022, a member of the Special Committee received a call from a representative of a financial sponsor firm (\u201cFinancial Sponsor A\u201d) with\nwhom this member of the Special Committee had an ongoing professional relationship. On the call, Financial Sponsor A requested to meet with Mr.\nMcClain and implied that Financial Sponsor A was interested in evaluating a potential transaction. Pending discussion with the full Special Committee,\nand in light of this member\u2019s professional relationship with Financial Sponsor A, this member of the Special Committee did not respond to Financial\nSponsor A\u2019s request on the call.\nAlso on March 7, 2022, Mr. McClain had a pre-scheduled call with a representative of a financial sponsor firm (\u201cFinancial Sponsor B\u201d) which had\nhistorically had routine discussions with the Company without discussions regarding any specific potential transaction. This call had been scheduled to\ndiscuss matters unrelated to a potential transaction. On the call, the representative of Financial Sponsor B asked Mr. McClain whether SailPoint has\nconsidered engaging in a going-private transaction. Mr. McClain did not respond substantively to this question.\nOn March 8, 2022, Morgan Stanley sent customary relationship disclosures to Goodwin, which information was shared with the Special Committee,\ndisclosing certain relationships between Morgan Stanley and representatives thereof on the one hand and SailPoint and Thoma Bravo, and their\nrespective affiliates, on the other hand. These disclosed relationships included the fact that Morgan Stanley is a counterparty to SailPoint with respect to\ncertain derivative call option transactions entered into in connection with the Company\u2019s issuance of its convertible notes due 2024, and that the public\nannouncement of a potential transaction may result in adjustments to such derivative transactions, which adjustments may be favorable to Morgan\nStanley.\nLater on March 8, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Morgan Stanley also\nattended portions of the meeting and representatives of Goodwin attended the meeting. Further to the Committee\u2019s March 7, 2022 meeting, the Committee,\nMorgan Stanley and Goodwin discussed potential alternative responses to Thoma Bravo. Following this discussion, the Committee instructed Morgan\nStanley to respond to Thoma Bravo with a message that (i) some directors on the full Board believed that the deal price should be at least $70.00 per share\nand others believed that the deal price should at least be in the upper $60s per share, (ii) SailPoint was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure agreement\nwith Thoma Bravo and proceed expeditiously with value-critical due diligence so that Thoma Bravo could submit a revised offer, and (iii) determinations\nabout other procedural and legal matters including post-signing go-shop terms would be deferred pending further Committee review, but that the\nCommittee was not prepared to enter into a potential transaction without a pre-signing market check. Following Morgan Stanley\u2019s departure from the\nmeeting, Goodwin reviewed the Morgan Stanley relationship disclosure with the Committee, and the Committee determined that Morgan Stanley should\nbe engaged as its financial advisor. The Committee directed Goodwin to negotiate formal terms of SailPoint\u2019s engagement with Morgan Stanley, which\nnegotiations continued through to March 18, 2022. The member of the Special Committee who received the call from Financial Sponsor A on March 7,\n2022 also informed the Committee about the call and, following this director\u2019s departure from the meeting, the Committee discussed potential engagement\nwith Financial Sponsor A and authorized this director to respond to Financial Sponsor A and approve a meeting between Financial Sponsor A and Mr.\nMcClain. This director conveyed this message to Financial Sponsor A on March 8, 2022.\nLater on March 8, 2022, Morgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and conveyed the message of the Committee described above. On the call, Thoma Bravo\nconveyed to Morgan Stanley that it accepted the Committee\u2019s determination for Thoma Bravo to enter into a non-disclosure agreement, commence value-\ncritical due diligence and, subject to the outcomes of such due diligence, may potentially submit a revised offer price. Morgan Stanley then shared a draft\nnon-disclosure agreement prepared by Goodwin with Thoma Bravo and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Thoma Bravo\u2019s outside counsel (\u201cKirkland\u201d).\nOn March 9, 2022, Morgan Stanley received from Thoma Bravo an initial markup of the Company\u2019s form of non-disclosure agreement, and promptly\nshared these markups with Goodwin and the Company. Later on March 9, 2022, SailPoint and Thoma Bravo entered into a non-disclosure agreement that\nincluded a standstill provision that prohibited Thoma Bravo, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the agreement, from offering\n37\nTable of Contents\nto acquire or acquiring SailPoint, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of SailPoint (but did not\ninclude a so-called \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision), subject to the ability of Thoma Bravo to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and\nto certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry, commencement or public announcement of certain change of control\ntransactions involving the Company and any third party.\nAlso on March 9, 2022, the Company received from Thoma Bravo a list of high-priority due diligence requests.\nOn March 11, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also attended the\nmeeting and representatives of Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. Morgan Stanley reported on the March 8, 2022 call between it and\nThoma Bravo described above. The Committee also discussed Mr. McClain\u2019s upcoming meeting with Financial Sponsor A on March 15, 2022. Later on\nMarch 11, 2022, Morgan Stanley and Goodwin shared with Company management guidance and direction for Mr. McClain\u2019s meeting with Financial\nSponsor A.\nOn March 15, 2022, Mr. McClain met by videoconference with representatives of Financial Sponsor A and discussed potential strategic partnership\nopportunities or other strategic alternative opportunities between SailPoint and Financial Sponsor A.\nLater on March 15 and March 16, 2022, members of SailPoint management met in-person with members of the Thoma Bravo deal team to conduct a\nmanagement presentation.\nOn March 17, 2022, SailPoint received a revised non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo to acquire SailPoint for $62.00 per share in cash (the\n\u201cMarch 17 Proposal\u201d). The $62.00 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint\u2019s last closing price prior to March 17, 2022 of approximately 41%.\nThe Specified Non-Binding Terms remained unchanged in the March 17 Proposal. Thoma Bravo contemporaneously called Morgan Stanley and\nconveyed that (i) Thoma Bravo was prepared to enter into a definitive agreement within two weeks, (ii) Thoma Bravo expected to be able to secure\nfinancing commitments in respect of the full consideration and (iii) Thoma Bravo preferred that the Company expeditiously enter into a definitive\nagreement with Thoma Bravo containing a \u201cgo-shop\u201d and therefore avoid delays associated with a pre-signing market check. Pending discussion with\nthe Special Committee, Morgan Stanley did not respond substantively to these points, including the request to sign expeditiously without a pre-signing\nmarket check, other than to note that the $62.00 per share offer price appeared to be inadequate relative to the price guidance previously conveyed to\nThoma Bravo by Morgan Stanley on March 8, 2022. The March 17 Proposal was promptly shared with the Special Committee.\nOn March 18, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also attended the\nmeeting and representatives of Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. The Committee discussed the March 17 Proposal, as well as Thoma\nBravo\u2019s other points conveyed to Morgan Stanley, including that it preferred that the Company sign expeditiously without a pre-signing market check.\nFollowing discussion, the Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to respond to Thoma Bravo that (i) the $62.00 per share offer price remained inadequate,\n(ii) the Committee would consider an offer price in the upper $60s for a potential transaction and (iii) the Company firmly rejected any limitations on the\nCompany\u2019s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance with the Committee\u2019s sole discretion. The Committee also discussed a plan for a\npre-signing market check, and determined that if Thoma Bravo reverted with a meaningfully improved offer price, then the Company would promptly\ncommence a pre-signing market check at that point and would revert to Thoma Bravo with a specific counterproposal of $67.00 per share. The Committee\nalso discussed the timing, scope, sequencing and messaging for a potential pre-signing market check. The Committee members expressed their belief that\ninvolving financial sponsor counterparties in the market check was riskier as compared to strategic counterparties, on account of, among other things,\ntheir lack of strategic synergies and therefore reduced ability to compete on price and the risks of leaks due to their potentially involving co-investors or\nother equity investors and debt financing sources. In light of these concerns, the Committee members discussed limiting the involvement of financial\nsponsors in any pre-signing market check exclusively to those sponsors that had recently and specifically reached out to SailPoint indicating interest in a\npotential transaction. Mr. McClain\n38\nTable of Contents\nalso updated the Committee on his meeting with Financial Sponsor A on March 15, 2022 and his impression that Financial Sponsor A was highly\ninterested in a potential transaction.\nLater on March 18, 2022, Morgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and conveyed the message of the Committee that (i) the $62.00 per share offer price\nremained inadequate, (ii) the Committee would consider an offer price in the upper $60s for a potential transaction and (iii) the Company firmly rejected\nany limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance with the Committee\u2019s sole discretion.\nLater on March 18, 2022, SailPoint received a revised non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo to acquire SailPoint for $63.50 per share in cash (the\n\u201cMarch 18 Proposal\u201d). The $63.50 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint\u2019s last closing price prior to March 18, 2022 of approximately 43%.\nThe Specified Non-Binding Terms remained unchanged in the March 18 Proposal. The March 18 Proposal was promptly shared with the Special\nCommittee. In response, and in accordance with the direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley responded later on March 18, 2022 with a\ncounterproposal of $67.00 per share.\nFollowing negotiation between Goodwin (on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee) and Morgan Stanley, on March 18, 2022, SailPoint\nalso signed a formal engagement letter with Morgan Stanley in connection with a potential transaction, which engagement letter was effective as of\nJanuary 10, 2022.\nOn March 19, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan\nStanley also attended the meeting. The Committee discussed the March 18 Proposal and the Committee\u2019s counterproposal with a $67.00 per share price\ntarget, as well as strategy and potential responses from Thoma Bravo.\nLater on March 19, 2022, Morgan Stanley received a call from Thoma Bravo verbally conveying that Thoma Bravo would soon submit a revised non-\nbinding letter of intent to acquire SailPoint for $65.25 per share in cash, which Thoma Bravo expressly characterized on the call as its \u201cbest and final\u201d offer\n(the \u201cMarch 19 Verbal Proposal\u201d). The $65.25 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint\u2019s last closing price prior to (i) March 19, 2022 of\napproximately 40%, (ii) March 18, 2022 of approximately 47%, (iii) March 17, 2022 of approximately 49% and (iv) March 2, 2022 of approximately 46%. On\nthe call, Thoma Bravo conveyed to Morgan Stanley that, in light of the significant premium represented by the $65.25 per share offer price, which\nrepresented a premium to the Company\u2019s all-time high trading price, Thoma Bravo was expecting that, if the Company engaged in a pre-signing market\ncheck, that it would be limited in scope.\nPromptly following the receipt of the March 19 Verbal Proposal on March 19, 2022, the Special Committee re-convened by videoconference. Members of\nSailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. The Committee discussed the March 19 Verbal\nProposal. The Committee reaffirmed that it would reject any limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance\nwith the Committee\u2019s sole discretion. The Committee also noted that, having extensively discussed and taken into account various important\nconsiderations pertaining to the involvement of financial sponsors in a market check, including their lack of strategic synergies and reduced ability to\ncompete on price and the risks of leaks due to their potential involvement of co-investors or other equity investors and debt financing sources, the\nCommittee had intended to limit the involvement of financial sponsors in any pre-signing market check exclusively to those sponsors that had recently\nand specifically reached out to SailPoint indicating interest in a potential transaction. The Committee then discussed the timing, scope and sequencing of\nthe Company\u2019s pre-signing market check, with input from Morgan Stanley, reviewing each potential strategic and financial sponsor counterparty and\ndetermining to exclude certain strategic and financial sponsor counterparties from the market check on account of various considerations, including the\nrisk of leaks and competitive sensitivities, as well as each counterparty\u2019s level of execution risk and ability to undertake an all-cash acquisition rather than\nan all-stock or mixed-consideration acquisition. The Committee determined to commence the market check on March 21, 2022 with respect to strategic\ncounterparties, with financial sponsor counterparties to follow later that week on account of the risks previously addressed.\n39\nTable of Contents\nLater on March 19, 2022, following the Special Committee meeting, SailPoint received a revised non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo\nmemorializing the $65.25 Verbal Proposal to acquire SailPoint for $65.25 per share in cash, which was expressly characterized in the letter of intent as\nThoma Bravo\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d offer (such letter, together with the March 19 Verbal Proposal, the \u201cMarch 19 Final Proposal\u201d). The Specified Non-Binding\nTerms remained unchanged in the March 19 Final Proposal. This letter of intent was promptly shared with the Special Committee. Later on March 19, 2022,\nMorgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and (i) conveyed that the Board would meet on March 20, 2022 to discuss the March 19 Final Proposal, (ii)\ndiscussed certain valuation assumptions underlying the March 19 Final Proposal and the letters of intent preceding it and (iii) reiterated the message of\nthe Committee that the Company firmly rejected any limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance with the\nCommittee\u2019s sole discretion.\nOn March 20, 2022, the Board met by videoconference.

Special Committee considered the following positive reasons to support the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the price of $65.25 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to SailPoint\nstockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of SailPoint common stock, including the fact that\n$65.25 per share to be received by SailPoint stockholders in the Merger represents a premium of approximately 32% over the closing price of\nSailPoint common stock as of April 8, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger, a premium of approximately\n48% over the 90-day volume-weighted average price of

in the event SailPoint sought to pursue discussions with all third\nparties who may be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with SailPoint prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential\nnegative effect that such a process might have on SailPoint\u2019s business, especially in light of the go-shop provision Thoma Bravo was\nwilling to provide that would allow for SailPoint

negotiations with Thoma Bravo and its representatives (as described in more detail under the section\nof this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d), $65.25 per share was the highest price that Thoma Bravo was willing to\npay as of the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms

The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below\nmust be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was directed by the Board of Directors\nto rely upon, among other matters, (i) the Projections and (ii) certain estimates of equity research analysts (the \u201cStreet Consensus\u201d). The Projections are\nmore fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Projections.\u201d In accordance with direction from the Board of Directors,\nMorgan Stanley utilized the Street Consensus and the Projections in its financial analyses described below.\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for SailPoint with comparable publicly available\nconsensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, that share similar\nbusiness characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue\ngrowth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the \u201ccomparable\ncompanies\u201d).\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, which, for purposes of this analysis, (1) for\nSailPoint, (a) was provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use, by SailPoint management for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for the\nProjections, and (b) was based on available consensus equity analyst research estimates for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for the Street Consensus\u037e and\n(2) for each of the comparable companies, was based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes. For\npurposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less cash and cash\nequivalents.\n53\nTable of Contents\nFor calendar year 2022, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for the comparable companies was 7.3x to\n13.4x, with a median observed multiple of 10.5x. For calendar year 2023, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate value to estimated\nrevenue for the comparable companies was 6.0x to 10.0x, with a median observed multiple of 8.7x.

Morgan Stanley then applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant revenue metric for SailPoint. For purposes of\nthis analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as of April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of\nthe Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger).\nBased on the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock on a fully diluted basis and latest cash and debt balance as provided by SailPoint\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of SailPoint common stock as follows:\nPublic Trading Multiples\nSelected\nComparable\nCompany AV/\nEstimated Revenue\nMultiple Ranges\nImplied Value\nPer\nShare of\nSailPoint\nCommon\nStock ($)\nCY 2022E AV / Revenue\nStreet Consensus\n8.5x \u2013 11.0x\n44.00 \u2013 55.27\nProjections\n9.0x \u2013 11.5x\n46.99 \u2013 58.47\nCY 2023E AV / Revenue\nStreet Consensus\n7.0x \u2013 9.0x\n43.86 \u2013 54.77\nProjections\n7.5x \u2013 9.5x\n52.20 \u2013 64.61\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to SailPoint. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made\nnumerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,\nmany of which are beyond SailPoint\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on SailPoint\u2019s business and the industry\ngenerally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of SailPoint and the industry, and in\nthe financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using\ncomparable company data.\n54\nTable of Contents\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company\nas a function of such company\u2019s estimated future revenue. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied\npresent value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of the SailPoint common\nstock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Consensus and Projections.\nTo calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2024 revenue estimates under each of the Street\nConsensus and Projections, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a forward\nrange of aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples (based on the range of aggregate value to revenue multiples for the comparable companies) to\nthese revenue estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future-implied fully diluted aggregate value. For each of the Street Consensus and Projections,\nMorgan Stanley applied an aggregate value to estimated revenue multiple of 8.0x to 10.0x to generate an undiscounted, implied future fully diluted equity\nvalue.\nIn each case, Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future fully diluted equity value to April 8, 2022, at a discount rate of 9.8%, which rate\nwas selected by Morgan Stanley based on SailPoint\u2019s estimated cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6%\nmarket risk premium, a risk-free rate of 2.7% based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of April 8, 2022, and a 1.2 predicted beta per Barra.

Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for the\nSailPoint common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value SailPoint as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the\nProjections for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization (burdened by stock based compensation), less taxes and capital expenditures, and adjusted for changes in net working\ncapital. The Projections included extrapolations through calendar year 2036 prepared by Morgan Stanley with the guidance of SailPoint management\n(which extrapolations were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by SailPoint management). The free cash flows and terminal values were\ndiscounted to present values as of April 8, 2022, at a discount rate ranging from 8.6% to 10.5%, which discount rates were selected, upon the application\nof Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of SailPoint\u2019s weighted average cost of capital estimated using the\ncapital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6% market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 2.7% based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of April 8,\n2022, and a 1.2 predicted beta per Barra. To calculate terminal values, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent as part\nof its analyses, with such rates selected upon the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value\nwas then adjusted for net debt and further adjusted to add the net present value of net operating losses.\n55\nTable of Contents\nBased on the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by SailPoint\u2019s management, Morgan Stanley calculated\nthe estimated implied value per share of SailPoint common stock as follows:\nImplied, Discounted\nValue Per\nShare of SailPoint\nCommon\nStock ($)\nProjections\n35.74 \u2013 58.93\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly available\nfinancial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected software transactions. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable\ntransactions based on its professional judgment and experience, including because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably\nbecause they were similar software transactions since 2018. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value of the\ntransaction to the estimated next 12 months\u2019 (referred to as \u201cNTM\u201d) revenue based on publicly available information at the time of announcement or at\nthe unaffected date of each such transaction.\nThe following is a list of the selected software transactions reviewed, together with the applicable multiples:\nSelected Software Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAV/NTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nStrategic Acquirors\nAdaptive Insights Inc. / Workday, Inc.\n11.0x\nAuth0, Inc. / Okta, Inc.\n~39x\nAvast Plc / NortonLifeLock Inc.\n9.6x\nCallidus Software Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n8.3x\nCarbon Black, Inc. / VMware, Inc.\n8.0x\nLivongo Health, Inc. / Teladoc Health, Inc.\n44.9x\nMulesoft, Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n15.7x\nQualtrics International Inc. / SAP America, Inc.\n16.5x\nSendGrid, Inc. / Twilio Inc.\n15.7x\nSlack Technologies, Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n24.9x\nTableau Software Inc. / Salesforce.com, Inc.\n11.0x\nFinancial Sponsor Acquirors\nAnaplan, Inc. / Thoma Bravo, LLC\n13.9x\nApptio Inc. / Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n7.0x\nCambium Learning Group, Inc. / Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C.\n4.2x\nCloudera, Inc. / Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC\u037e Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

In evaluating the precedent transactions,\nMorgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond SailPoint\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on SailPoint\u2019s\nbusiness and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of\nSailPoint and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value\nand fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of\nSailPoint derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the $65.25 per share in cash to be received by holders of\nshares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nanalysis of the consideration for the Merger, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but which\nwere noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.

LLC\u2014Equity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets.\u201d\nIllustrative Precedent Premiums\nMorgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent transaction premiums analysis by reviewing software company transactions larger than $1 billion in\naggregate value since 2014. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the\nimplied premium to the acquired company\u2019s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the last full trading day prior to the\nshare price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news)\u037e and (2) the implied premium to the acquired company\u2019s 52-week high\nclosing share price prior to announcement.\nBased on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley\nselected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to\n57\nTable of Contents\nSailPoint\u2019s closing share price on April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger\nAgreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger) and (2) a\nrepresentative range of premia and applied such range to SailPoint\u2019s 52-week high closing share price:\nPremia\nRepresentative\nRanges\nImplied Value per\nShare of\nSailPoint\nCommon Stock\n($)\nPremia to 1-Day Unaffected Share Price\n15% \u2013 45%\n57.98 \u2013 73.11\nPremia to 52-Week High Share Price\n(20%) \u2013 15%\n50.69 \u2013 72.86\nHistorical Trading Ranges\nMorgan Stanley noted certain trading ranges with respect to the historical share prices of SailPoint common stock. Morgan Stanley reviewed a range of\nprices of the SailPoint common stock for various periods ending on April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to\napprove and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the Merger). Morgan Stanley observed the following:\nTrading Periods\nRange of Trading\nPrices Per Share of\nSailPoint Common\nStock ($)\nLast 30 Days ending on April 8, 2022\n41.16 \u2013 52.46\nLast 90 Days ending on April 8, 2022\n35.71 \u2013 52.46\nLast 365 Days ending on April 8, 2022\n34.98 \u2013 63.36\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for SailPoint common stock prepared and published by equity research analysts\nprior to April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the\nadvisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger). These targets reflected each analyst\u2019s\nestimate of the future public market trading price of SailPoint common stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for the SailPoint common\nstock was $45 to $70 per share as of various dates ranging from November 10, 2021 to April 4, 2022. Morgan Stanley then took the 25th \u2013 75th percentile\nwhich was $60\u2014$63 per share and discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for the SailPoint common stock by one year at a rate of 9.8%,\nwhich was the discount rate selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect SailPoint\u2019s cost of\nequity, estimated using the CAPM method and utilizing a 6% market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 2.7% based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of\nApril 8, 2022, and a 1.2 predicted beta per Barra. This analysis indicated an implied range of fully diluted equity values for SailPoint common stock of\n$54.63 to $57.36 per share.\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for SailPoint\ncommon stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of SailPoint and future financial market\nconditions.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any\n58\nTable of Contents\nparticular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given\nvarious analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than\nother assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan\nStanley\u2019s view of the actual value of SailPoint. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond SailPoint\u2019s control.\nThese include, among other things, the impact of competition on SailPoint\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of\nany adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of SailPoint and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates\ncontained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable\nthan those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the $65.25 per share\nin cash to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nand in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of April 10, 2022 to the Board of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or\nto reflect the prices at which shares of SailPoint common stock might actually trade.\nThe $65.25 per share in cash to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between SailPoint and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors.\nMorgan Stanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to\nSailPoint or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the\nMerger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other\nalternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not,\nconstitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how SailPoint Stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors to\napprove and adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the\nBoard of Directors with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to\nagree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other\nprofessionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nThe Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global\nfinancial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is\nengaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as\nproviding investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a\nprincipal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions,\nfor their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of SailPoint, Parent, Thoma Bravo and their respective\naffiliates, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition,\nMorgan Stanley, its affiliates directors or officers, including individuals working with SailPoint in connection with the Merger, may have committed and\nmay commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Thoma Bravo or its affiliates and their affiliated funds\u2019 respective portfolio\ncompanies (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cThoma Bravo Related Entities\u201d).\n59\nTable of Contents\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided SailPoint financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this section and\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the Merger, and SailPoint has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $62\nmillion for its services, $3 million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, upon the closing of the Merger, Morgan Stanley\nmay receive additional value resulting from adjustments to the Capped Call Transactions between Morgan Stanley and SailPoint entered into in\nconnection with SailPoint\u2019s issuance of convertible notes due in 2024. SailPoint has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including\nfees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, SailPoint has agreed to indemnify\nMorgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan\nStanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement,\nincluding certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nIn the thirty months prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing\nservices for SailPoint and received aggregate fees of approximately $2 to $5 million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services for Thoma Bravo and the Thoma Bravo Related Entities,\nand have received aggregate fees of approximately $10 to $25 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial\nadvisory and financing services to SailPoint, Thoma Bravo, Thoma Bravo Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to\nreceive fees for the rendering of these services.\nCapped Call Transactions",

            "text": "Capped Call Transactions\nOn September 19, 2019, in connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, SailPoint entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the\n\u201cBase Capped Call Transactions\u201d) with each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., RBC Capital Markets, LLC and\nJefferies International Limited or their respective affiliates (the \u201cCapped Call Counterparties\u201d). On September 20, 2019, in connection with the initial\npurchasers\u2019 exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, SailPoint entered into additional capped call transactions with the Capped\nCall Counterparties (the \u201cAdditional Capped Call Transactions\u201d and, together with the Base Capped Call Transactions the \u201cCapped Call Transactions\u201d).\nThe Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of SailPoint common stock that\ninitially underlie the Convertible Notes. The strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is $28.42 per share of SailPoint common stock, and the cap price\nof the Capped Call Transactions is $41.34 per share of SailPoint common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call\nTransactions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to SailPoint Stockholders upon conversion of the\nConvertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that SailPoint could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted\nConvertible Notes upon conversion thereof, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.\nIf the Merger is consummated, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes, which would result in termination of the Capped\nCall Transactions. Under the terms of the documents governing the Capped Call Transactions, each Capped Call Counterparty would be obligated to pay\nSailPoint the \u201cfair value\u201d of the transaction, determined pursuant to the terms of the relevant Capped Call Transaction. Such termination value will be\ndetermined by each Capped Call Counterparty, in its capacity as the calculation agent under its Capped Call Transaction, acting in good faith and in a\ncommercially reasonable manner. The amount of such early termination cash payment would depend on a variety of factors, including the remaining term\nof its Capped Call Transaction as of the date on which the Merger is consummated, the Per Share Merger Consideration, the volatility of SailPoint\ncommon stock prior to the announcement of the Merger, hedge unwind costs and applicable interest rates.\n60Table of Contents\nIn addition, following the announcement of the Merger, the Capped Call Counterparties may adjust the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, regardless\nof whether the Merger is consummated. Each Capped Call Counterparty may determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, in its\ncapacity as calculation agent with respect to its Capped Call Transaction, the economic effect of such an announcement on the value of its Capped Call\nTransaction and may take into account a number of factors, including, the date of the announcement (and the remaining term of its Capped Call\nTransaction at that time), the stock price of SailPoint common stock and changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected dividends of\nSailPoint common stock, in determining whether an adjustment to its Capped Call Transaction is appropriate. Each Capped Call Counterparty may make\nadditional adjustments to its Capped Call Transaction following the announcement of a change to the Merger, including a withdrawal from, or the\nabandonment or discontinuation of, the Merger.\nThe indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of the Capped Call Transactions were included as\nexhibits to SailPoint\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by SailPoint with the SEC on September 25, 2019.

Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although the\nManagement Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by SailPoint\nmanagement with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as\nwell as matters specific to SailPoint\u2019s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond SailPoint\u2019s\ncontrol. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, SailPoint\u2019s performance, industry\nperformance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws,\nregulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in SailPoint\u2019s reports filed with the SEC.\nThere can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the\nManagement Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each\nsuccessive year. In addition, the Management Projections will be affected by SailPoint\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the\napplicable periods. The Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore,\nbe considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections\nshould not be regarded as an indication that SailPoint, Morgan Stanley, their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or\nanyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this information should not be\nrelied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Management\nProjections will be necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by SailPoint or any other person regarding the Management\nProjections or SailPoint\u2019s ultimate performance compared to such information. The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction\nwith the historical financial statements and other information about SailPoint contained in SailPoint\u2019s public filings with the SEC. For more information,\nplease see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties\ninherent in the Management Projections, SailPoint Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.\nThe Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of\nthe SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to the preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The Management\nProjections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company\u2019s management. Grant Thornton LLP has\nnot audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Management Projections and,\naccordingly, Grant Thornton LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Grant Thornton LLP report\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates to the Company\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the\nManagement Projections and should not be read to do so.\nNon-GAAP EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA (SBC burdened) and Unlevered Free Cash Flow contained in the Management Projections summarized above are\n\u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used in the Management Projections were relied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion and by the Board of Directors and the\nSpecial Committee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which\n64\nTable of Contents\nwould otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures\nincluded in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy\nstatement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion or by the\nBoard of Directors or the Special Committee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, SailPoint has not provided a reconciliation of\nthe financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used\nby SailPoint may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe summary of such information above is included solely to give SailPoint Stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Board\nof Directors, the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley, Parent and Merger Sub, and is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any\nSailPoint Stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to their\nshares of SailPoint common stock. In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the\ndate they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, SailPoint does not intend to update\nor otherwise revise the Management Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect\nthe occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.\nInterests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger",

The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in\nevaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and recommending that the Merger Agreement be\nadopted by SailPoint Stockholders.\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following\nassumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe Effective Time is May 16, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this\nsection (the \u201cChange in Control Date\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of SailPoint will have been terminated by SailPoint without \u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive\nofficer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the Severance Pay Plan), in either case, immediately following the\nChange in Control Date\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a \u201ccutback\u201d to avoid the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d\nexcise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nFor purposes of this disclosure, (1) SailPoint\u2019s executive officers are: (i) Mark McClain, Chief Executive Officer\u037e (ii) Colleen Healy, Chief Financial Officer\u037e\n(iii) Matt Mills, President, Worldwide Field Operations\u037e (iv) Chris\n65Table of Contents\nSchmitt, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\u037e and (v) Grady Summers, Executive Vice President, Product and (2) SailPoint\u2019s named\nexecutive officers are: (i) Mark McClain, Chief Executive Officer\u037e (ii) Colleen Healy, Chief Financial Officer\u037e (iii) Cam McMartin, former Interim Chief\nFinancial Officer\u037e (iv) Matt Mills, President, Worldwide Field Operations\u037e (v) Jason Ream, former Chief Financial Officer\u037e (vi) Chris Schmitt, Executive Vice\nPresident, General Counsel and Secretary\u037e and (vii) Grady Summers, Executive Vice President, Product.\nAlthough Jason Ream, SailPoint\u2019s former Chief Financial Officer, is a named executive officer for purposes of this disclosure, Mr. Ream does not hold any\nunvested SailPoint equity awards and does not have any interests in the Merger except insofar as he may hold vested stock options or shares of\nSailPoint common stock.\nAs the amounts provided below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate as of the date referenced,\nthe actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nTreatment and Quantification of Company Equity Awards\nCompany Options\nAt the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per\nShare Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint common\nstock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to applicable withholding taxes.\nAt the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted\ninto the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per\nShare Merger Consideration over (ii) the per-share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint\ncommon stock underlying such Unvested Company Option. Subject to the holder\u2019s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the\nSurviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts will vest and\nbecome payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would\nhave vested pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to\nthe underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company Option\nConsideration.\nCompany RSUs\nAt the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of\nSailPoint common stock underlying such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to applicable withholding taxes.\nAt the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted\ninto the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,\n66\nTable of Contents\nequal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of SailPoint common stock underlying such Unvested Company RSU by (y)\nthe Per Share Merger Consideration.

Based on the assumptions described\nabove under the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger\u2014Certain\nAssumptions,\u201d the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable to SailPoint\u2019s eight (8) non-employee directors in respect of their Vested\nCompany RSUs is $1,470,735, which excludes any grants of Company RSUs that may be made by SailPoint to the non-employee directors following the\ndate of this proxy statement.\nAt the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company Option held by the executive officers will convert into cash awards of\nUnvested Company RSU Consideration and Unvested Company Option Consideration in the manner described above and will generally remain subject\nto the same time-based vesting conditions and other terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each award of\nUnvested Company RSU Consideration and Unvested Company Option Consideration will vest in the event that an executive officer experiences a\ntermination of employment by SailPoint without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive officer for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case, within three (3) months prior to the\nChange in Control Date or within the one (1) year following the Change in Control Date.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger\u2014Golden Parachute\nCompensation\u201d for an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each SailPoint named executive officer (including each SailPoint executive\nofficer) in respect of his or her Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs.\nSeverance Pay Plan\nSailPoint adopted a Severance Pay Plan under which each of the executive officers is eligible to receive certain severance payments benefits upon a\nqualifying termination of employment. The Severance Pay Plan generally provides that if the executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated by SailPoint\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or the executive officer terminates his or her employment with \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case, within three (3) months prior to the Change\nin Control Date or within one (1) year following the Change in Control Date, then the executive officer will be eligible to receive:\n\u2022\na lump-sum cash severance amount equal to 100% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary (or 150% of the annual base salary for the\nChief Executive Officer)\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinuation coverage for the executive officer and his or her spouse and eligible dependents under SailPoint\u2019s group health plans pursuant\nto the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, for twelve (12) months (or eighteen (18) months for the Chief\nExecutive Officer) at active employee rates, unless such coverage is earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Severance Pay\nPlan\u037e and\n67\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of all outstanding equity compensation awards held by the executive officer immediately prior to such termination of\nemployment, with performance-based equity awards vesting at the greater of actual performance as of such termination of employment or\ntarget performance.\nThe provision of payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer\u2019s execution of a release of claims. The Severance Pay\nPlan further provides that if an executive officer receives any amount that is subject to the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax imposed pursuant to Section\n280G and 4999 of the Code, the amount of the payments to be made to the executive officer will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of\nthe excise tax.\nTransaction and Retention Bonus Programs\nUnder the Merger Agreement, SailPoint may establish a transaction program (the \u201cTransaction Bonus Program\u201d) and a retention program (the \u201cRetention\nProgram\u201d) providing for cash bonuses in the aggregate amount not to exceed $5.0 million. Awards under the Transaction Bonus Program shall be\nallocated by SailPoint\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable after, but no later than thirty (30) days following,\nthe Effective Time, subject to the participant\u2019s continued service through the Effective Time. Awards under the Retention Program shall also be allocated\nby SailPoint\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable after, but no later than thirty (30) days following, the date\nthat is six months following the Effective Time, subject to the participant\u2019s continued service through the end of such six(6)-month period. As of the date\nof this proxy statement, none of the executive officers has received an award under the Transaction Bonus Program or the Retention Program.\nCompensation Arrangements with Parent\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of SailPoint\u2019s executive officers has discussed or entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its\naffiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the\nclosing of the Merger, however, some or all of SailPoint\u2019s executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or any of its affiliates\nregarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, SailPoint\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and\ncoverage for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the surviving corporation.\nThis indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement\u2014Indemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on, or otherwise\nrelates to, the Merger that will or may become payable to each named executive officer of SailPoint in connection with the Merger. Although Jason Ream,\nSailPoint\u2019s former Chief Financial Officer, is a named executive officer for purposes of this disclosure, Mr. Ream terminated employment with SailPoint on\nFebruary 28, 2022 and does not hold any unvested SailPoint equity awards and does not have any interests in the Merger except insofar as he may hold\nvested stock options or shares of SailPoint common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Ream has been omitted from the table below.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its\nentirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary\ndoes not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that SailPoint Stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under\nSection 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of SailPoint common stock unless\notherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of SailPoint common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in\nthat holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of SailPoint common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a\nbank, broker, trust or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner\nto perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of SailPoint common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise\nappraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, SailPoint Stockholders who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares\u037e (ii) do not vote in\nfavor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (iv) otherwise\nexactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive\npayment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of SailPoint common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be \u201cfair value,\u201d if any, as determined by the court. However, after\nan appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all SailPoint Stockholders who have asserted\nappraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares\nof SailPoint common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Merger\nConsideration in respect of the shares of SailPoint common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million\n(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for\ngood cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d)\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid.\nHowever, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily\npay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the\ntime of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The\nSurviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days\nprior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was\n73Table of Contents\nsuch on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and\ninclude in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes SailPoint\u2019s notice to SailPoint Stockholders that appraisal rights are available\nin connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any\nSailPoint Stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so, should review Annex C carefully.\nFailure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A\nSailPoint Stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger\nAgreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of SailPoint common stock,\nSailPoint believes that if a SailPoint Stockholder considers exercising such rights, that SailPoint Stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nSailPoint Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of SailPoint common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe SailPoint Stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe SailPoint Stockholder must deliver to SailPoint a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe SailPoint Stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder\nwill lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe SailPoint Stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint common stock held either in a voting trust or by\na nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a\ndetermination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is\nunder no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a SailPoint\nStockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not\nvote his, her or its shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny SailPoint Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to SailPoint, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the\nSpecial Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to SailPoint Stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of\nthe SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s shares, and that SailPoint Stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A\nholder of shares of SailPoint common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made\nand must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless\nrevoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and\nwill nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a SailPoint Stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must ensure that the proxy submitted contains instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting.\nNeither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of\nitself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the\ntaking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of SailPoint Stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\n74\nTable of Contents\nOnly a SailPoint Stockholder of record is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in\nrespect of shares of SailPoint common stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform SailPoint of the\nidentity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares\nare owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf\nof the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint owners, may execute a demand\nfor appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the\ndemand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nSAILPOINT STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO\nWISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO\nDETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF\nTHOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A\nBANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY\nMANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nSailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nAttention: General Counsel\n11120 Four Points Drive, Suite 100\nAustin, Texas 78726\nAny SailPoint Stockholder who has delivered a written demand to SailPoint and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Per Share Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement by delivering to SailPoint a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made\nmore than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will be dismissed as to any SailPoint Stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any SailPoint\nStockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share Merger Consideration within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is\ncommenced and SailPoint, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required,\nor, except with respect to any SailPoint Stockholder who withdraws such SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the\nimmediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a SailPoint\nStockholder, the SailPoint Stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could\nbe less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Merger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of SailPoint common\nstock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant\n75\nTable of Contents\nto Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date\nthereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any SailPoint Stockholder who has\ncomplied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant shares) may\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of\na petition filed by a SailPoint Stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares held by all dissenting\nSailPoint Stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and\nSailPoint Stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nthe shares of SailPoint common stock. Accordingly, any SailPoint Stockholder who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary\naction to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of SailPoint common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.\nThe failure of a holder of SailPoint common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s\nprevious written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of SailPoint common stock who has complied with the requirements\nof Section 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a\nstatement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which SailPoint\nhas received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the\nrequesting SailPoint Stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten\n(10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint common\nstock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request\nfrom the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a SailPoint\nStockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of SailPoint common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation,\nthe Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified\nlist containing the names and addresses of all SailPoint Stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the\nvalue of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and\nplace fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of SailPoint Stockholders shown on the written statement\ndescribed above at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of\ngeneral circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne\nby the Surviving Corporation. After notice to SailPoint Stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a\nhearing on the petition to determine those SailPoint Stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights\nthereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require SailPoint Stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates\n(if any) to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any SailPoint Stockholder fails to\ncomply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that SailPoint Stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all SailPoint Stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.\n76\nTable of Contents\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining SailPoint Stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to\nSailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of\nChancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of SailPoint common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,\ntogether with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the \u201cfair value.\u201d In determining \u201cfair value,\u201d the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge)\nas established from time to time during the period from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid. However, at any time before the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each SailPoint Stockholder entitled to appraisal an\namount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of\nsuch voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining \u201cfair value\u201d in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and\notherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Supreme Court of Delaware stated that, in making this determination of \u201cfair value,\u201d the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light\non future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that \u201cfair value\u201d is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the\nDelaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting SailPoint\nStockholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nSailPoint Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not\nseek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger\nConsideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262. No representation is\nmade as to the outcome of the appraisal of \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and SailPoint Stockholders should recognize\nthat such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither\nSailPoint nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Merger Consideration to any SailPoint Stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each\nof SailPoint and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of SailPoint common stock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a\npetition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to SailPoint Stockholders seeking\nappraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged\n77\nTable of Contents\nupon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a SailPoint Stockholder, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a SailPoint Stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares\nentitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any SailPoint Stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of SailPoint common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively\nloses or withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of SailPoint common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the\nEffective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. A SailPoint Stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the\nholder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership\nthresholds described above has been satisfied as to SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the SailPoint Stockholder delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance\nwith Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no SailPoint Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of SailPoint common\nstock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s\nshares of SailPoint common stock, if any, payable to SailPoint Stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if\nneither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or if the SailPoint\nStockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within sixty\n(60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such SailPoint Stockholder to an\nappraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as\nto any SailPoint Stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just\u037e\nprovided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any SailPoint Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined\nthat proceeding as a named party to withdraw such SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within\nsixty (60) days after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a SailPoint Stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.\nConsequently, any SailPoint Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those\nrights.\nAccounting Treatment",

This discussion is\nlimited to holders who hold their shares of SailPoint common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property\nheld for investment purposes). For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cholder\u201d means either a U.S. Holder (as defined below) or a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined\nbelow) or both, as the context may require.\n78Table of Contents\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their\nparticular facts and circumstances, nor does it address any consequences to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such\nas:\n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\ndealers in securities\u037e\n\u2022\ntraders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreal estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt entities\u037e\n\u2022\nholders who hold their shares of SailPoint common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction or\nconversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\npartnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS corporations,\u201d or any other pass-through\nentities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities)\u037e\n\u2022\npersons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of SailPoint common stock (by vote or value)\u037e and\n\u2022\nholders that received their shares of SailPoint common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as\ncompensation.\nThis discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax consequences other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other non-\nincome tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income tax consequences, or the consequences of the Medicare tax on net\ninvestment income. If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner\nof shares of SailPoint common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the\npartner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of SailPoint common stock and partners therein should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular circumstances.\nNo ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger described herein. This summary is\nnot binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS\nor that they would be sustained by a court if so challenged.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS\nCONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.\n79\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cU.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint common stock\nthat is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons\nas defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a\nUnited States person as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of SailPoint common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash\nreceived and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of SailPoint common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted\ntax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of SailPoint common stock. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss\nand will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the Merger. A reduced\ntax rate on capital gain will generally apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cNon-U.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint\ncommon stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSpecial rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment, such as \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d or\n\u201cpassive foreign investment companies.\u201d Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax\nconsequences that may be relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in\nwhich case such gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to a United States person as defined\nunder the Code, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of\n30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-three (183) days or more in the taxable\nyear of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate\nof 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty).\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger.\nBackup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder that\n80\nTable of Contents\nfurnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a\nsubstitute successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS\nForm W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional\ntax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability\u037e\nprovided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nHOLDERS OF SAILPOINT COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF\nTHE MERGER TO THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER\nTAX LAWS.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nSailPoint and Parent have agreed to take all action necessary to comply with all regulatory notification requirements, and, subject to certain limitations, to\nobtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals\ninclude approval under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws (whether domestic or foreign).\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until SailPoint and Thoma Bravo Fund XV-a, L.P. each files a\nNotification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the\napplicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-\ncalendar-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms. If the FTC or DOJ issues a request for\nadditional information and documents (which we refer to as a \u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must\nobserve a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request.\nSailPoint and Thoma Bravo Fund XV-a, L.P. each filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger with the FTC and\nDOJ on April 29, 2022. The HSR waiting period is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on May 31, 2022.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC,\nthe DOJ or any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin\nthe completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or seeking to require the parties to license or hold separate assets or\nterminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nThe Merger is subject to the expiration of the applicable review periods under, or the receipt of approvals or clearances under, the relevant foreign\ninvestment laws of Australia and the United Kingdom, in each case unless a relevant exemption applies. In addition, relevant regulatory bodies could take\naction under other applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking\n81\nTable of Contents\nto enjoin or otherwise prevent the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to\ntake legal action under regulatory laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on regulatory grounds will\nnot be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.\n82\nTable of Contents",
