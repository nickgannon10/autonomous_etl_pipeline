If you\nattend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $53.00 in\ncash, without interest, subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of Maxar common stock\nthat you own (other than any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you\nhave properly and validly exercised (and do not withdraw) your appraisal rights in accordance with, and\ncomplied with, Section 262 of the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Maxar common stock,\nyou will receive $5,300 in cash in exchange for your shares of Maxar common stock (other than any\nUnconverted Shares), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Unconverted Shares\nmeans (a) certain shares of Maxar common stock held in the treasury of Maxar or owned, directly or\nindirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiaries of Maxar (in each case, other than\nany such shares of Maxar common stock held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf\nof third parties), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) shares of Maxar common\nstock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by\nholders who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have properly\nand validly exercised (and not withdrawn) appraisal rights in accordance with, and who have complied\nwith, Section 262 of the DGCL.

For purposes of clause (x) in the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of\ncommon stock subject to a Maxar PSU will equal (i) for a PSU granted in 2020, 175% of the target number\nof shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU, (ii) for a PSU granted in 2021, 176% of the\ntarget number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU, and (iii) for a PSU granted in\n2022, 184% of the target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such PSU.

Accordingly, a U.S. Holder who exchanges shares of Maxar common\nstock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if\nany, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in the shares of Maxar common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such\nU.S. Holder.\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address\nstate, local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to\nspecial treatment under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to\ndetermine the particular tax consequences to you of the Merger.\nWhat will I receive for my SARs, RSUs, PSUs, or DSUs, as applicable, in the Merger?\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time:\nRSUs, 2023 Employee RSUs, PSUs, DSUs and SARs that are outstanding as of immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive the Cash Amount equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Maxar common\nstock subject to such award and (y) the Merger Consideration (and for SARs, less the exercise price\nper share of Maxar common stock subject to such SAR), less any required tax withholding and\ndeductions.

The affirmative vote of the holders\nof the shares of Maxar common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person, or\nby remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the\nCompensation Proposal is required to approve the Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of the\nholders of the shares of Maxar common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in\nperson, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to\nvote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Maxar stockholder of record to: (a)\nsubmit a signed proxy card\u037e (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the\ninstructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fVoting at the\nSpecial Meeting\u201d)\u037e or (c) attend the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nMerger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nCompensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a\n14 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nquorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how\nto vote your shares (resulting in \u201cbroker non-votes\u201d) will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nCompensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,\nabstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, the\nCompensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark\nthe boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed\nproxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nWhat constitutes a quorum?\nThe holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote present in\nperson, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Special\nMeeting. Because there were 75,549,337 shares of Maxar common stock outstanding and entitled to vote\nas of the Record Date, we will need holders of at least 37,774,669 shares present in person, or by remote\ncommunication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting to achieve a quorum.\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Maxar stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any\nother reason, Maxar stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Maxar common stock.\nInstead, Maxar will remain an independent public company, Maxar common stock will continue to be\nlisted and traded on the NYSE and the TSX and registered under the Exchange Act, and Maxar will\ncontinue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC and applicable Canadian securities regulators.\nUnder specified circumstances, Maxar will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $124.5 million,\nupon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fees.\u201d\nWhy are Maxar stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Maxar to seek an advisory (nonbinding)\nvote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger.\nWhat will happen if Maxar stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote\nwith respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Maxar.\nTherefore, if the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed,\nthe amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Maxar\u2019s named\nexecutive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nWhat do I need to do now?\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy\nstatement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this\nproxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how\nit affects you.

For example, you may own some shares directly as a Maxar stockholder of\nrecord and other shares through a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In\nthese situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of\nthe proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy\ncards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive comes\nwith its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy\ncard in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with\nanother Maxar stockholder?\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery\nrequirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more Maxar stockholders sharing the same\naddress by delivering a single proxy statement to those Maxar stockholders. This process, which is\ncommonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially provides extra convenience for Maxar\nstockholders and cost savings for companies.\nMaxar and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy\nmaterials to multiple Maxar stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary\ninstructions have been received from the affected Maxar stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish\nto participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your\nhousehold is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future\ndeliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage\naccount or Maxar if you are a Maxar stockholder of record by making a request to our Corporate\nSecretary at 1300 West 120th Avenue, Westminster, Colorado 80234 or by calling our proxy solicitor,\nGeorgeson LLC, at (888) 613-9817. In addition, Maxar will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request\nto the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nThe preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special\nMeeting. In addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, Maxar\nwill file the final voting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been\ncertified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n18 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nMaxar has engaged Georgeson LLC, which we refer to as \u201cGeorgeson,\u201d to assist in the solicitation of\nproxies for the Special Meeting. Maxar estimates that it will pay Georgeson a fee of approximately\n$20,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Maxar has agreed to indemnify\nGeorgeson against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies\n(subject to certain exceptions).\nMaxar also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their\nrespective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Maxar\ncommon stock. Maxar directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by\nelectronic means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nWe currently expect to complete the Merger in mid-2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the\nMerger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the\nMerger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control.\nHow can I obtain additional information about Maxar?\nMaxar will provide copies of this proxy statement and any documents incorporated by reference herein\n(not including exhibits to the documents that are incorporated by reference unless such exhibits are\nspecifically incorporated by reference into such documents) without charge to any Maxar stockholder\nwho makes a request to our Corporate Secretary in writing at 1300 West 120th Avenue, Westminster,\nColorado 80234 or by telephone at (303) 684-7660.

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of Maxar\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the\nBoard of Directors and Maxar\u2019s management periodically review, consider and assess Maxar\u2019s operations\nand financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals\nand plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for\nbusiness\n29 TABLE OF CONTENTS\ncombinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, as compared to the benefits and\nrisks of continued operation as a standalone company, and have sometimes included outside financial and\nlegal advisors.\nOn May 16, 2022, a representative of Advent contacted General Howell M. Estes, III, Chairman of the\nBoard of Directors, regarding Advent\u2019s potential interest in Maxar. Later that day, representatives of Advent\nemailed Daniel L. Jablonsky, Maxar\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and indicated that representatives of Advent\nwould be in Colorado later that month and that they would like to meet with Mr. Jablonsky and other\nmembers of Maxar\u2019s management to discuss their view of Maxar\u2019s future business prospects and other\npotential opportunities. Following such communication, Maxar\u2019s then-Chief Strategy Officer (the \u201cCSO\u201d)\nagreed to meet by videoconference with representatives of Advent to discuss such matters.\nOn May 26, 2022, representatives of Advent met with the CSO by videoconference and provided\nbackground information with respect to Advent and defense and aerospace companies in which Advent had\ninvested or that Advent had acquired, including Cobham Limited and Ultra Electronics. Representatives of\nAdvent explained that they believed that Maxar was well positioned for future success and that Advent was\nconfident in Maxar\u2019s future business prospects. The substance of this meeting was relayed by the CSO to\nMr. Jablonsky and other members of Maxar\u2019s management team.\nOn May 27, 2022, representatives of Advent sent an email to Mr. Jablonsky stating that they had\nenjoyed their meeting with Maxar, and that they would like to open up a dialogue between Advent and Maxar\nabout ways in which Advent might be helpful to Maxar in the future. They also requested a follow up\nmeeting with Maxar in which Mr. Jablonsky would participate. In this email, representatives of Advent did\nnot provide a specific agenda or proposal with respect to which they intended to discuss or propose during\nsuch a meeting, and Mr. Jablonsky did not schedule a meeting with Advent following the May 27, 2022 email.\nOn June 15, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the \u201cJune 15 Letter\u201d),\naddressed to Mr. Jablonsky and General Estes. The June 15 Letter contained a nonbinding indication of\ninterest for Advent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock at a value of $48 per\nshare in cash. The June 15 Letter noted, among other things, that Advent\u2019s proposal was subject to the\nsatisfactory completion of confirmatory due diligence (supplementary to Advent\u2019s already-completed\noutside-in diligence) as well as the negotiation and execution of a merger agreement and other related\ndocumentation, and attached as an exhibit a due diligence request list. The June 15 Letter also noted that the\ntransaction would not be subject to a financing condition. Promptly following receipt of the June 15 Letter,\nMr. Jablonsky shared it with the Board of Directors.\nOn June 17, 2022, Mr. Jablonsky emailed representatives of Advent a letter confirming receipt of the\nJune 15 Letter, stating that the June 15 Letter had been shared with the Board of Directors, and that the\nBoard of Directors would review the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter carefully, with the assistance of\nMaxar\u2019s financial and legal advisors. Mr. Jablonsky\u2019s letter stated that he would respond to the proposal in\nthe June 15 Letter after the Board of Directors had the opportunity to review and consider the proposal.\nFollowing receipt of the June 15 Letter, based upon discussions with General Estes and other\nindependent directors, Mr. Jablonsky and Maxar\u2019s management determined that it would be advisable for\nMaxar to retain a financial advisor to aid Maxar\u2019s management and the Board of Directors in evaluating the\nproposal contained in the June 15 Letter. Between June 15, 2022 and July 28, 2022, members of Maxar\u2019s\nmanagement met with several candidates, and determined to explore retaining J.P. Morgan as financial\nadvisor to Maxar in connection with its consideration of the June 15 Letter. J.P. Morgan was selected based\non its qualifications, expertise and reputation in the aerospace and defense sectors, and its knowledge of the\nbusiness and affairs of Maxar.\nOn July 6, 2022, representatives of Advent contacted members of Maxar\u2019s management team to inquire\nabout a response to the June 15 Letter. On July 8, 2022, members of Maxar\u2019s management team reiterated the\nsentiments expressed in Mr. Jablonsky\u2019s June 17, 2022 letter: that Maxar would respond to the June 15 Letter\nonce the Board of Directors had carefully reviewed and considered the proposal contained therein.\nOn July 28, 2022, the Board of Directors held a regularly scheduled, in-person meeting in Westminster,\nColorado, during which members of Maxar\u2019s management, representatives of Maxar\u2019s financial advisor,\n30 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJ.P. Morgan, and representatives of Maxar\u2019s legal counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell\nLipton\u201d) participated. Additionally, representatives of Milbank LLP (\u201cMilbank\u201d), regulatory counsel to\nMaxar, participated in the meeting telephonically. At the meeting, Mr. Jablonsky described Maxar\u2019s contacts\nwith Advent, including the May 26, 2022 meeting and the June 15 Letter and the proposal contained therein.\nA representative of Wachtell Lipton provided an overview of the Board of Directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\nDelaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Maxar. Representatives of J.P.\nMorgan provided an overview of the current market landscape based on publicly available information and\nMaxar\u2019s historical performance based on publicly available information and information provided by Maxar\u2019s\nmanagement. Additionally, representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board of Directors J.P. Morgan\u2019s\npreliminary financial analysis of the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter, based on the July 2022 Base\nCase Forecast. The representatives of J.P. Morgan also discussed various precedent transactions, including\nrecent leveraged buyout transactions by private equity sponsors, the state of the U.S. leveraged financing\nmarket and the difficulties facing that market at that time, and addressed the potential impact such difficulties\ncould have on Advent\u2019s ability to obtain financing in connection with a potential transaction, and other\npublic market considerations. Additionally, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Milbank reviewed the\nlikely regulatory approvals that would be required to consummate a transaction with Advent, as well as the\nfeasibility and likely timing of such approvals.\nFollowing the presentations by Maxar\u2019s advisors, the Board of Directors discussed the June 15 Letter\nand how best to proceed with respect to the proposal contained therein. In particular, the Board of Directors\ndiscussed (i) the possibility that undertaking any potential transaction could result in significant distraction\nand diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar\u2019s strategic priorities,\nincluding the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program, (ii) the state of the U.S. leveraged\nfinancing market and whether the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter was likely to be actionable in light\nof the then-current market conditions, (iii) the likelihood that Advent and its potential financing sources\nwould agree to be required to complete any potential transaction in the event that the WorldView Legion\nprogram was not successful, and the significant negative impact on Maxar and its stockholders that would\nlikely arise from a failed transaction, and (iv) the valuation of Maxar that could be achieved upon the\nsuccessful execution of Maxar\u2019s business plan relative to the consideration proposed in the June 15 Letter,\nincluding risks related to Maxar\u2019s ability to execute successfully on its business plan and the likely impact\nthat certain adverse changes to the business plan would have. In light of these and other considerations\ndiscussed among members of the Board of Directors and Maxar\u2019s management, the Board of Directors\nunanimously determined that further engagement with Advent with respect to Advent\u2019s June 15 Letter was\nnot warranted at the time. The Board of Directors directed members of Maxar\u2019s management to inform Advent\nof the Board of Directors\u2019 decision.\nAdditionally, following the July 28, 2022 meeting, the Board of Directors determined that Maxar should\nretain J.P. Morgan as Maxar\u2019s financial advisor in connection with Maxar\u2019s consideration of Advent\u2019s\nproposal and related matters.\nOn August 1, 2022, Mr. Jablonsky emailed a letter (the \u201cAugust 1 Letter\u201d) to representatives of Advent\nthat responded to the June 15 Letter. The August 1 Letter stated that the Board of Directors had carefully\nreviewed and considered the June 15 Letter, with the assistance of Maxar\u2019s financial and legal advisors, and\nhad unanimously determined that the proposal contained in the June 15 Letter did not provide a basis for\nfurther discussions at that time, and that the Board of Directors believed that it was in the best interest of\nMaxar and its stockholders for the company to remain focused on the execution of its business plan and, in\nparticular, the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program.\nOn August 22, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the \u201cAugust 22 Letter\u201d)\naddressed to Mr. Jablonsky and General Estes. The August 22 Letter contained an updated nonbinding\nproposal for Advent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock at a value of $50 per\nshare in cash. Additionally, the August 22 Letter reiterated Advent\u2019s request for additional confirmatory due\ndiligence information, stating if Advent were allowed access to certain due diligence information, Advent\ncould be in a position to either reaffirm or increase the value of its proposal. Promptly following receipt of\nthe August 22 Letter, Mr. Jablonsky shared it with the Board of Directors. Mr. Jablonsky also confirmed to\nrepresentatives of Advent that he had received the August 22 Letter.\n31 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 29, 2022, representatives of Advent sent an email to Mr. Jablonsky to inquire as to the status\nof Maxar\u2019s response to the August 22 Letter and request an in person meeting in the coming weeks with Mr.\nJablonsky.\nMr. Jablonsky discussed the August 22 Letter and Advent\u2019s August 29, 2022 email with General Estes\nand other members of the Board of Directors, as well as members of Maxar management and representatives\nof J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton. These conversations included discussions of the reasons why the\nBoard of Directors had instructed Mr. Jablonsky to inform Advent following the Board of Directors\u2019 July 28,\n2022 meeting that the June 15 Letter did not warrant further discussion, including, in particular, the\npossibility that undertaking any potential transaction process could result in significant distraction and\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar\u2019s strategic priorities, including\nthe successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program and the likelihood that Advent and its potential\nfinancing sources would agree to complete any potential transaction in the event that the WorldView Legion\nprogram was not successful, and the significant negative impact on Maxar and its stockholders that would\nlikely arise from a failed transaction. During these conversations and others, it was noted that Advent\u2019s new\nproposal did not address whether a proposed transaction and any committed financing in connection\ntherewith would be subject to the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program, and members of\nthe Board of Directors expressed the view that Maxar\u2019s response to the August 22 Letter and Advent\u2019s\nAugust 29, 2022 email did not warrant a different response than the June 15 Letter.\nFollowing these conversations, on September 6, 2022, Mr. Jablonsky emailed a letter (the \u201cSeptember 6\nLetter\u201d) to representatives of Advent, which stated that the Board of Directors had determined that the\nproposal contained in the August 22 Letter did not provide a basis for further discussion. The September 6\nLetter also noted that, consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors continually assesses\nopportunities to enhance Maxar stockholder value, and that following the deployment of the WorldView\nLegion program, engagement with respect to a potential transaction might be fruitful.\nAdditionally, following Mr. Jablonsky\u2019s transmission of the September 6 Letter, members of Maxar\u2019s\nmanagement instructed J.P. Morgan to inform Advent that J.P. Morgan was acting as Maxar\u2019s financial\nadvisor, and to explain to Advent that the September 6 Letter had advised that continued engagement\nfollowing the deployment of Maxar\u2019s WorldView Legion program might be more fruitful because of the\npossibility that undertaking any potential transaction at the current time could result in significant\ndistraction and diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar\u2019s strategic\npriorities, including the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program, and the Board of\nDirectors\u2019 concern that Advent and its potential financing sources would not agree to be required to\ncomplete any potential transaction in the event that the WorldView Legion program was not successful.\nDuring these discussions, representatives of Advent explained to representatives of J.P. Morgan that\nAdvent\u2019s proposal was not conditioned upon the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program.\nActing at the instruction of members of Maxar management, J.P. Morgan asked Advent to provide greater\nclarity in writing regarding its commitment to accept the risk that the WorldView Legion program would not\nbe successful in a potential transaction.\nOn September 12, 2022, during the course of a conversation at an international trade conference, the\nChief Executive Officer of Party A informed Mr. Jablonsky that Party A had long admired Maxar, and that\nParty A might be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Maxar, but would not be prepared to\ndiscuss any such transaction for a period of six to nine months. Mr. Jablonsky informed the Chief Executive\nOfficer of Party A that Party A should contact Mr. Jablonsky if Party A had a proposal or strategic\ntransaction that Party A wished to discuss with Maxar. Mr. Jablonsky promptly informed the Board of\nDirectors of his conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A. Since the September 12, 2022\nconversation, representatives of Party A have not made any such proposal.\nOn September 19, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the \u201cSeptember 19\nLetter\u201d) addressed to Mr. Jablonsky and General Estes. The September 19 Letter stated that its purpose was\nto clarify that Advent\u2019s proposal was not conditioned upon the successful deployment of the WorldView\nLegion program. Mr. Jablonsky promptly shared the September 19 Letter with the Board of Directors\nfollowing its receipt.\n32 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFollowing receipt of the September 19 Letter, Mr. Jablonsky engaged in discussions with General Estes,\nother members of Maxar\u2019s management and representatives of each of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton.\nAmong other things, these discussions focused on (i) the need for greater clarity with respect to the extent\nof Advent\u2019s commitment regarding its proposal not being conditioned on the successful deployment of the\nWorldView Legion satellite program, including how such assurances would be documented in the definitive\ndocumentation for a potential transaction, (ii) the challenging state of the U.S. leveraged financing market,\nand the concern that potential financing sources might not agree to provide a potential purchaser with\ncommitted financing in a transaction where the purchaser had assumed the risk related to the successful\ndeployment of the WorldView Legion satellite program, and (iii) the other matters considered by the Board of\nDirectors at its July 28, 2022 meeting. Following such discussions, members of Maxar\u2019s management\ninstructed J.P. Morgan to communicate to Advent the need for greater specificity with respect to the matters\naddressed in the September 19 Letter, as well as the need for Advent to reaffirm its $50 per share price.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan promptly communicated these messages to Advent.\nOn September 30, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed to Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the \u201cSeptember 30\nLetter\u201d). The September 30 Letter stated that Advent appreciated the feedback it had received from\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan with respect to the September 19 Letter, and sought to clarify the meaning of\nAdvent\u2019s statement that Advent\u2019s proposal was not conditioned upon the successful deployment of the\nWorldView Legion program. Specifically, the September 30 Letter stated that: (i) any transaction agreement\nwould be structured such that Advent would bear 100% of the risk related to any potential failure of the\nWorldView Legion program to perform (launch, deployment, post-launch functionality, etc.), such that the\nfailure of the WorldView Legion program to perform would have no bearing on Advent\u2019s obligation to\nconsummate the proposed transaction, or affect the purchase price, (ii) such transaction agreement would\nexpressly exclude WorldView Legion-related risks impacting the future performance of the WorldView Legion\nprogram from any \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d definition and closing conditions in such agreement, and would\nalso not include bring-down tests linked to WorldView Legion program-related representations and\nwarranties, and (iii) Advent\u2019s potential financing sources had agreed to the framework identified in clauses\n(i) and (ii) of this paragraph. Additionally, the September 30 Letter included the $50 price per share that\nAdvent had included in the August 22 Letter. Mr. Jablonsky promptly shared the September 30 Letter with\nthe Board of Directors following its receipt.\nOn October 12, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, during which members\nof Maxar\u2019s senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of Wachtell Lipton were\npresent. Mr. Jablonsky explained that the purpose of the meeting was for the Board of Directors to discuss\nthe updated proposal from Advent to acquire Maxar for $50 per share in cash contained in the August 22\nLetter, as supplemented by the September 19 Letter and the September 30 Letter. A representative of Wachtell\nLipton discussed legal matters, including the Board of Directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the\ncontext of the consideration of Advent\u2019s proposal. Additionally, members of Maxar\u2019s management and of J.P.\nMorgan reviewed with the Board of Directors the July 2022 Base Case Forecast, as well as the October 2022\nSatellite Loss Case Forecast, which had been prepared by Maxar\u2019s management to analyze the long-term\nfinancial impact of the potential loss or failure of satellites, including satellites that are to be part of the\nWorldView Legion satellite program, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\nCertain Financial Projections.\u201d Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the Board of Directors\ntheir preliminary financial analysis of the proposal contained in the August 22 Letter. The representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan also discussed various precedent transactions, including recent leveraged buyout transactions\nby private equity sponsors, the state of the U.S. leveraged financing market and the difficulties facing that\nmarket at present, including the potential impact such difficulties could have on Advent\u2019s ability to obtain\nfinancing in connection with a potential transaction, and other public market considerations.\nFollowing this discussion, members of the Board of Directors further discussed the proposal and\npotential responses, including in the context of Maxar\u2019s standalone plan, as well as potential short- and\nlong-term execution and strategic risks to Maxar\u2019s long-range financial plan on a standalone basis. In\nparticular, members of the Board of Directors discussed (i) that Advent\u2019s $50 per share proposal represented\napproximately a 96% premium to the closing price of Maxar common stock on August 19, 2022, as well as an\napproximately 173% premium to the closing price of Maxar common stock on September 29, 2022, the day\nprior to the September 30 Letter, (ii) the statements contained in the September 19 Letter and the\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSeptember 30 Letter with respect to Advent\u2019s acceptance of risks related to the WorldView Legion program in\na potential transaction, (iii) the intensive efforts required of Maxar and its management to successfully\nexecute on Maxar\u2019s strategic priorities, including making the WorldView Legion program a success, and the\ndistraction that could result from engaging with Advent or other potential acquirers with respect to a\npotential transaction, along with the fact that there would be no guarantee that Maxar would reach final\nagreement with respect to such a transaction, even one that shifted the risk related to the deployment of the\nWorldView Legion program to the purchaser, and (iv) the challenging state of the U.S. leveraged financing\nmarket, and the Board of Directors\u2019 assessment that it might be challenging for Advent to secure committed\nfinancing for a potential transaction. The Board of Directors also discussed, including with representatives\nof Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan, whether it would be advisable to contact other potential bidders,\nincluding in the context of an auction, before engaging discussions with Advent. As part of such\ndiscussions, the Board of Directors also considered concerns that such a process could result in additional\ndistraction and diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts away from the execution of Maxar\u2019s strategic\npriorities, including the successful deployment of the Worldview Legion program, and that such a process\ncould also result in market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction, which could disrupt Maxar\u2019s\nbusiness relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in Maxar\u2019s stockholder base\nand potential stock price volatility. Additionally, the members of the Board of Directors discussed whether it\nwould be in the best interest of Maxar and its stockholders to permit Advent to perform a limited amount of\nconfirmatory commercial due diligence, in order to evaluate whether Advent\u2019s proposal to acquire Maxar and\nto obtain the committed financing required in connection therewith, was executable, while also minimizing the\ndistraction to members of management as they continued to execute on Maxar\u2019s strategic priorities, including\npreparing for the deployment of the WorldView Legion program. Following discussion of these and other\nconsiderations among members of the Board of Directors, Maxar\u2019s management and Maxar\u2019s financial and\nlegal advisors, the Board of Directors did not reach a conclusion with respect to any further engagement\nwith Advent, but determined to meet again to continue its discussion.\nOn October 16, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, during which members\nof Maxar\u2019s senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of Wachtell Lipton were\npresent. Mr. Jablonsky explained that the purpose of the meeting was for the Board of Directors to continue\nits discussion of Advent\u2019s proposal to acquire Maxar for $50 per share in cash contained in the August 22\nLetter, as supplemented by the September 19 Letter and the September 30 Letter. A representative of Wachtell\nLipton discussed certain legal matters, including the Board of Directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under Delaware law\nin the context of the consideration of Advent\u2019s proposal. Additionally, representatives of J.P. Morgan\ndiscussed in greater detail the state of the U.S. leveraged finance market, including that some transactions\ncontinued to be completed notwithstanding the generally challenging financing environment, noting that\ndirect lenders had played a more prominent role in acquisition financings in recent months, and that Advent\nhad expressed an interest in working with direct lenders in connection with the financing of a proposed\ntransaction with Maxar.\nFollowing this discussion, members of the Board of Directors discussed whether or not the proposal\nfrom Advent was credible, including based on Advent\u2019s prior diligence evaluation that Advent noted in its\nprior letters that it had completed, Advent\u2019s efforts to engage with potential financing sources and its\nwillingness to bear the risk with respect to the WorldView Legion program between the signing and closing\nof any transaction. Members of Maxar\u2019s senior management then discussed with the Board of Directors their\nviews with respect to the possibility of a transaction with Advent, and their opinion on the views of Maxar\u2019s\nstockholders with respect to such a transaction. The Board of Directors discussed a framework for potential\nlimited engagement with Advent with respect to a potential transaction, noting that at any time Maxar would\nhave the opportunity to immediately terminate discussions with Advent should it become clear that Advent\nwould not be able to provide a fully financed transaction with a customary degree of transaction certainty, or\nif the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of Maxar and its stockholders to do so.\nMembers of the Board of Directors discussed this framework and, after considering the factors discussed at\nboth of the October 12, 2022 and October 16, 2022 meetings of the Board of Directors, instructed\nmanagement to proceed with providing a limited amount of business diligence to Advent, with instructions\nto Advent that, prior to the Thanksgiving holiday on November 24, 2022, Advent would be required to\ndeliver a revised proposal to Maxar including, in particular, documentation and other assurance to support\nthe availability of committed financing to Advent for a proposed transaction at a price of at least $50 per\nshare.\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFollowing this determination, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Advent to\nexplain the proposed framework. Additionally, between October 17, 2022 and October 19, 2022, Maxar and\nAdvent negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and\nAdvent\u2019s legal counsel, Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP (\u201cWeil\u201d), participating in such negotiations. On\nOctober 19, 2022, Maxar and Advent entered into the confidentiality agreement, which included a customary\nstandstill provision and a list of permitted financing sources, including BCI. In connection with the entry of\nthe confidentiality agreement, representatives of Advent shared with Maxar and its advisors a due diligence\nrequest list containing items that Advent stated it required in order to submit the proposal contemplated by\nMaxar\u2019s proposed framework.\nOn October 25 and 26, 2022, the Board of Directors held regularly scheduled, in-person meetings in\nWestminster, Colorado. During these meetings, Mr. Jablonsky provided an update of the discussions with\nAdvent, including that Mr. Jablonsky and other members of Maxar\u2019s senior management had scheduled a\nmeeting with representatives of Advent in Colorado for October 28, 2022. Additionally, on October 26, 2022,\nmembers of Maxar\u2019s senior management reviewed with the Board of Directors the October 2022 Base Case\nForecast, which had been prepared by Maxar\u2019s management in the ordinary course to (i) reflect, among other\nupdates, Maxar\u2019s actual financial results for the period since the July 2022 Base Case Forecast had been\nprepared, and (ii) incorporate management\u2019s projected results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027,\nas more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Certain Financial Projections.\u201d\nOn October 27, 2022, Maxar began uploading due diligence materials to a confidential data room hosted\nby Intralinks (the \u201cData Room\u201d). Representatives of Advent received access to the Data Room shortly\nthereafter.\nOn October 28, 2022, members of Maxar\u2019s management met in person with representatives of Advent\nand of certain potential financing sources with whom Maxar had given its prior written consent for Advent to\nshare Maxar\u2019s confidential information in Colorado, including BCI. At this meeting, management of Maxar\nprovided representatives of Advent with additional information regarding Maxar\u2019s business, potential areas\nof value and Maxar\u2019s management\u2019s view of Maxar\u2019s future prospects as a standalone company.\nAdditionally, Maxar\u2019s management and representatives of Advent and of the potential financing sources\nheld multiple business diligence meetings by videoconference during the weeks of November 7, 2022 and\nNovember 14, 2022. Additionally, during this time, Maxar made available additional confidential business\ndiligence information to Advent and its representatives, as well as to the potential financing sources.\nOn November 2, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed Mr. Jablonsky a letter (the \u201cNovember 2\nLetter\u201d) addressed to Mr. Jablonsky stating that they appreciated the opportunity to meet with Mr.\nJablonsky and members of Maxar\u2019s management in Colorado during the management presentation on\nOctober 28, 2022. The November 2 Letter also stated that Advent continued to be very interested in pursuing\nan acquisition of Maxar at $50 per share, and would look to improve on the $50 per share price, as outlined in\nAdvent\u2019s August 22 Letter. Additionally, the November 2 Letter stated that Advent and the potential\nfinancing sources anticipated submitting an updated proposal with draft documentation related to the\ncommitted financing prior to the Thanksgiving holiday as contemplated by the framework proposed by\nMaxar. The November 2 Letter also requested that Maxar consent to provide confidential information to a\nlimited number of additional potential financing sources, including additional direct lenders, in order to\nincrease the certainty of any committed financing, and potentially improve its terms. Mr. Jablonsky promptly\nshared the November 2 Letter with the Board of Directors following its receipt. Additionally, Maxar provided\nits consent for Advent to share confidential information with a limited number of additional potential\nfinancing sources.\nOn November 11, 2022, a representative of a global investment bank placed a telephone call to Mr.\nJablonsky. The representative of the global investment bank informed Mr. Jablonsky that he was calling on\nbehalf of a client that might be interested in a potential strategic transaction with Maxar, and that he was\ncalling to gauge Maxar\u2019s interest in such a transaction. The representative of the global investment bank,\nhowever, declined to identify his client to Mr. Jablonsky. Mr. Jablonsky informed the representative that\nMaxar continually assesses opportunities to enhance Maxar stockholder value, and that if the\nrepresentative\u2019s client had a proposal for Maxar and the Board of Directors to consider, then the\nrepresentative\u2019s client should contact Mr. Jablonsky. Mr. Jablonsky promptly informed the Board of\nDirectors of his conversation with the representative of the global investment bank.\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 22, 2022, Maxar filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the \u201cEchoStar 8-K\u201d) disclosing that\nMaxar had entered into an amendment to its contract (such amendment, the \u201cEchoStar Amendment\u201d and\nsuch contract, the \u201cEchoStar Contract\u201d) with an affiliate of EchoStar Corporation (\u201cEchoStar\u201d) related to the\ndelay of the shipment of the JUPITER 3 satellite, following EchoStar having communicated its intention to\nMaxar to terminate its contract with Maxar as a result of the delay and demand return of all monies paid by\nEchoStar to Maxar. Additionally, the EchoStar 8-K also disclosed the anticipated financial impact of the\namendment on Maxar\u2019s guidance, including that (i) there will be no change to Maxar\u2019s 2022 free cash flow\nguidance, (ii) there will be a $65 million reduction in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2022, (iii) there will be\nan approximately $20 million reduction in free cash flow in 2023 related primarily to the forgone payments\nfrom EchoStar, and (iv) there would be up to an estimated $30 to $40 million reduction in free cash flow in\n2023 attributable to the purchase of goods and/or services pursuant to a certain separate commercial\nagreement entered into between Maxar and EchoStar, as amended. In response to these events, Maxar\u2019s\nmanagement made adjustments to its long-term strategic plan as a result of the EchoStar Amendment, which\nadjustments were incorporated into the November 2022 Base Case Forecast and the November 2022 Satellite\nLoss Case Forecast, in each case as defined and described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\nCertain Financial Projections.\u201d\nOn November 23, 2022, representatives of Advent emailed a letter to Mr. Jablonsky containing a\nproposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Maxar common stock for $50 per share in cash (the\n\u201cNovember 23 Proposal\u201d). Consistent with the framework proposed by Maxar following its Board of\nDirectors\u2019 October 16, 2022 meeting, the November 23 Proposal also (i) stated that Advent had completed its\ncommercial and financial due diligence, (ii) confirmed that Advent and its potential financing sources had\ncompleted its diligence with respect to the WorldView Legion program and reaffirmed their position that the\ntransaction would not be conditioned on the successful deployment of the WorldView Legion program and\n(iii) provided additional detail with respect to the equity and debt financing plan for the proposed\ntransaction. Advent included with the November 23 Proposal drafts of each of the Commitment Letters,\nwhich were subject to the completion of confirmatory due diligence and the negotiation of definitive\ntransaction documentation. The November 23 Proposal also reaffirmed that the successful deployment of the\nWorldView Legion program would not be a condition to the consummation of the financing in connection\nwith the proposed transaction, and stated that Advent was in a position to negotiate definitive\ndocumentation with Maxar and announce a transaction by December 16, 2022. As a next step, the November\n23 Proposal suggested that the parties and their advisors engage immediately, including with respect to\ncustomary confirmatory due diligence to supplement the materials provided to date. Mr. Jablonsky promptly\nshared the November 23 Proposal with the Board of Directors following its receipt.\nOn November 23, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, during which\nmembers of Maxar\u2019s senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of Wachtell\nLipton were present. Mr. Jablonsky explained that the purpose of the meeting was for the Board of Directors\nto discuss the November 23 Proposal, and the Board of Directors\u2019 response to such proposal. Mr. Jablonsky\nsummarized Maxar\u2019s interactions with Advent and its representatives since the October 16, 2022 meeting of\nthe Board of Directors, including the October 28, 2022 management presentation. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan then reviewed current market conditions, Maxar\u2019s historical stock price and financial profile and the\nperspectives of financial analysts that cover Maxar. Additionally, the representatives of J.P. Morgan\nreviewed the financial market\u2019s reaction to the recently announced amendment to the EchoStar Contract, and\nmembers of the Board of Directors and their financial and legal advisors discussed the risks inherent in\nMaxar\u2019s business and the potential for the proposed transaction to \u201cde-risk\u201d for stockholders Maxar\u2019s\nexecution with respect to its WorldView Legion program and the other aspects of its long-term plan. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton then reviewed the terms of the November 23 Proposal,\nincluding the draft debt and equity commitment letters provided with the proposal, which were intended to\naddress the Board of Directors\u2019 questions at prior meetings regarding Advent\u2019s commitment to the proposal\nand its ability to obtain committed financing in a challenging acquisition financing market. Representatives\nof J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton also discussed Advent\u2019s proposed timeline, which included a target\nannouncement date of December 16, 2022. The representatives of J.P. Morgan then presented to the Board of\nDirectors its preliminary financial analyses of the November 23 Proposal, based on the November 2022 Base\nCase Forecast and the November 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast.\n36 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdditionally, members of Maxar\u2019s management and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with\nthe Board of Directors the inclusion of BCI as a minority equity investor as part of the November 23\nProposal, and the fact that Milbank had informed members of Maxar\u2019s management that the proposed\ntransaction outlined in the November 23 Proposal would be subject to CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction.\nFollowing this discussion, members of the Board of Directors, Maxar\u2019s management and representatives\nof J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton discussed the November 23 Proposal, including whether the proposal\nprovided a basis with which to engage with Advent and whether it represented an improvement over\nAdvent\u2019s prior proposals. In particular, members of the Board of Directors discussed (i) Advent\u2019s continued\nwillingness to accept the risk related to the WorldView Legion program, such that Maxar would not be\nsubject to risk of non-consummation of a transaction based on the success of that program, (ii) the fact that\nthe $50 price per share represented a 116% premium to the closing price of Maxar common stock on\nNovember 23, 2022 and (iii) the likely regulatory approvals in connection with a proposed transaction and the\npotential timeline associated in connection therewith.\nMembers of the Board of Directors, Maxar\u2019s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and\nWachtell Lipton discussed the benefits and risks of potential next steps available to Maxar, including (i)\nceasing engagement with Advent and continuing as a standalone company, (ii) engaging with Advent on its\nproposed timeline of a December 16, 2022 announcement, without proactively seeking other potential\nbidders, and requiring as a condition of such engagement with Advent that any definitive agreement with\nAdvent include a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision or other mechanism that would permit Maxar to solicit and entertain\npotentially superior proposals from other bidders while having a binding contract with Advent, or (iii)\nengaging with Advent, either on its proposed timeline or on a longer timeline, while also reaching out to\nother potential bidders before entering into a transaction with Advent. In particular, the Board of Directors,\nMaxar\u2019s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton discussed the risks of\ncontacting other bidders before engaging in continued discussions with Advent, including concerns that\nmarket leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt Maxar\u2019s business relationships and\nrisk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in Maxar\u2019s stockholder base and potential stock price\nvolatility, and the limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire Maxar given its\nsize and the challenging U.S. market for acquisition financing. Members of the Board of Directors also\ndiscussed the fact that, given that the first anticipated launch of the Worldview Legion satellite program was\nplanned for early 2023, announcing a proposed transaction with Advent by December 16, 2022 would \u201cde-\nrisk\u201d the effect of that launch for Maxar stockholders. Additionally, members of the Board of Directors\ndirected J.P. Morgan and Maxar\u2019s management to seek to increase the $50 per share price set forth in the\nNovember 23 Proposal.\nFollowing this discussion, Mr. Jablonsky, the other members of Maxar\u2019s management and the\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting, and the independent members of the Board of Directors met\nin executive session with Wachtell Lipton. General Estes explained that the purpose of the executive session\nwas for the independent members of the Board of Directors to discuss whether to continue engagement with\nAdvent, and if so, under what terms. A representative of Wachtell Lipton then advised the independent\nmembers of the Board of Directors of their fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of their\nconsideration of Advent\u2019s proposal. The independent members of the Board of Directors then discussed the\nNovember 23 Proposal, and the best path available to maximize value for Maxar and its stockholders, during\nwhich the directors discussed each of the factors and considerations previously mentioned, along with the\nimpact of the recent EchoStar settlement described in the EchoStar 8-K, the directors\u2019 high level of\nconfidence in Maxar\u2019s management team, the risks inherent in Maxar\u2019s business and the potential for the\nproposed transaction to \u201cde-risk\u201d for stockholders Maxar\u2019s execution with respect to its WorldView Legion\nprogram and the other aspects of its long-term plan.\nFollowing this discussion, Mr. Jablonsky and members of Maxar\u2019s management rejoined the meeting.\nMembers of the Board of Directors then discussed Maxar\u2019s potential as a standalone company with members\nof management and the risks inherent in Maxar\u2019s business, as well as the valuation of Advent\u2019s November 23\nProposal, and the committed financing that Advent appeared likely to secure if a proposed transaction could\nbe agreed. As a result, the Board of Directors unanimously determined that it was in the best interest of\nMaxar and its stockholders to proceed to negotiate the terms and documentation of an acquisition of Maxar\nby affiliates of Advent, for cash, including to determine if the $50 price per share proposed by Advent\n37 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin the November 23 Proposal could be improved, and seek from Advent assurances of satisfactory\narrangements with respect to both financing and other matters related to transaction certainty, and to inform\nAdvent that any merger agreement must include a \u201cgo-shop\u201d or other similar mechanism to provide a market\ncheck, subject in all cases to final approval by the Board of Directors.\nFollowing the Thanksgiving holiday, on November 25, 2022, after discussions with Mr. Jablonsky and\nmembers of Maxar\u2019s management, representatives of J.P. Morgan met telephonically with representatives of\nAdvent. During this telephone call, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with Advent changes to the\nNovember 23 Proposal that could make it more attractive to Maxar, including: (i) meaningfully improving the\n$50 price per share in the November 23 Proposal\u037e (ii) providing for a robust go-shop period during which\nMaxar and its representatives would be permitted to solicit bids from third parties\u037e (iii) providing a\ntermination fee equal to 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction, payable by Maxar to Advent in the event\nthat Maxar terminated its agreement with Advent to enter into a definitive agreement with a topping bidder,\nprovided that such termination fee would be equal to 1.25% of the equity value of the transaction if Maxar\nterminated its agreement with Advent to enter into an agreement with a bidder during the go-shop period\u037e\nand (iv) providing a high degree of transaction certainty, including with respect to obtaining any required\nregulatory approvals.\nOn November 25, 2022 and November 26, 2022, representatives of Advent and J.P. Morgan engaged in\nmultiple conversations with respect to the items raised by J.P. Morgan on November 25. Representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan kept Mr. Jablonsky updated as to the status of these conversations. On November 26, 2022,\nrepresentatives of Advent met by videoconference with representatives of J.P. Morgan and orally provided\nan updated proposal (the \u201cNovember 26 Proposal\u201d). The November 26 Proposal contained the same terms as\nthe November 23 Proposal, except that (i) the price per share in cash paid to Maxar stockholders would be\n$53, (ii) the merger agreement would provide Maxar with a 60-day go-shop period, and (iii) the merger\nagreement would provide for a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the equity value of the transaction, payable\nby Maxar to Advent in the event that Maxar terminated its agreement with Advent to enter into a definitive\nagreement with a topping bidder, provided that such termination fee would be equal to 1.25% of the equity\nvalue of the transaction if Maxar terminated its agreement with Advent to enter into an agreement with a\nbidder during the 60-day go-shop period. Additionally, Advent stated that the parties were willing to provide\na high degree of transaction certainty, including with respect to obtaining the CFIUS Approval and any other\nrequired regulatory approvals. Advent suggested that representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Milbank and J.P.\nMorgan discuss questions they might have with respect to the CFIUS Approval and other required\nregulatory approvals with representatives of Weil and Covington & Burling LLP (\u201cCovington\u201d), regulatory\ncounsel to Advent. Representatives of J.P. Morgan promptly summarized the terms of the November 26\nProposal to Mr. Jablonsky, members of Maxar\u2019s management and representatives of Wachtell Lipton. Mr.\nJablonsky promptly shared the details of the November 26 Proposal with the Board of Directors following its\nreceipt.\nOn November 27, 2022, representatives of Weil, Covington, Wachtell Lipton and Milbank met by\nvideoconference. During this meeting, representatives of Covington provided an overview of BCI and\ndescribed the regulatory efforts commitments to which Advent was willing to agree in the definitive\ntransaction documentation, which would provide a high degree of transaction certainty, including with\nrespect to obtaining any required regulatory approvals. Following the November 27, 2022 meeting,\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and Milbank described the information provided during the meeting,\nincluding Advent\u2019s proposed regulatory efforts commitments, to Maxar\u2019s management. For more information,\nsee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fRegulatory Approvals and Related\nMatters.\u201d\nConsistent with the views expressed by the Board of Directors at its November 23, 2022 meeting, on\nNovember 28, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed representatives of Advent that Maxar was\nprepared to proceed to negotiate a transaction on the terms of the November 26 Proposal, but that any such\nproposed transaction was subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation and the approval of the\nBoard of Directors.\nIn addition, beginning on November 28, 2022, Maxar made certain additional due diligence materials\navailable to Advent and its representatives in the Data Room. Thereafter, from November 28, 2022 through\nDecember 15, 2022, Advent, with the assistance of its advisors, conducted confirmatory due diligence on\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMaxar, including through the additional materials made available in the Data Room and telephone and\nvideoconference calls with members of Maxar\u2019s management. Also, during that period representatives of\nWachtell Lipton and Milbank participated in telephone and videoconference calls with Advent, BCI and their\nrespective regulatory counsel with respect to regulatory due diligence.\nOn November 29, 2022, the representative of the global investment bank that had contacted Mr.\nJablonsky on November 11, 2022 placed a telephone call to Mr. Jablonsky. During this telephone call, the\nrepresentative identified his client as Party B, and asked that Mr. Jablonsky speak with the Chief Executive\nOfficer of Party B to discuss Party B\u2019s thoughts on a potential strategic transaction. On November 30, 2022,\nMr. Jablonsky and his executive assistant contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Party B to schedule a\ntelephone call, which was scheduled for December 8, 2022. During the December 8, 2022 telephone\nconversation, the Chief Executive Officer of Party B informed Mr. Jablonsky that if Maxar ever determined to\nengage in a strategic transaction, that Party B would potentially be interested in such a transaction. Mr.\nJablonsky informed the Chief Executive Officer of Party B that if Party B wished to make a proposal providing\nfor a strategic transaction with Maxar, then it should do so promptly, in writing. Mr. Jablonsky promptly\ninformed the Board of Directors of his conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of Party B.\nOn November 30, 2022, Weil provided initial drafts to Wachtell Lipton of the proposed merger agreement\nand the other transaction documents. Between November 30, 2022 and December 15, 2022, the parties\u2019\nrespective management teams and legal and financial advisors engaged in extensive negotiations regarding\nthe terms of the proposed merger agreement and other transaction documentation.

Following this discussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview\nof the potential go-shop process if the parties reached a proposed transaction. After this discussion,\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan departed the meeting. Members of the Board of Directors then reviewed\ndisclosures from J.P. Morgan regarding material relationships with Maxar, Advent and certain of their\nrespective affiliates. The Board of Directors reviewed the disclosures and determined that none of the\ndisclosed relationships would impact J.P. Morgan\u2019s ability to act as financial advisor to Maxar in connection\nwith the potential transaction. The Board of Directors reiterated to members of Maxar\u2019s management the\ndirective it had provided at its November 23, 2022 meeting, and instructed Maxar\u2019s management and its\nadvisors to attempt to negotiate a transaction on the terms described in the November 26 Proposal, subject\nto final approval by the Board of Directors.\nOn December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended\nby members of Maxar\u2019s management and representatives of J.P.

Morgan led a discussion of the process that would begin once the 60-day go-shop\nperiod commenced after the announcement of the transaction, including with respect to planned outreach to\npotential bidders, including Party A and Party B. Following this discussion, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral\nopinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, to the Board of Directors on\nDecember 15, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set\nforth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Maxar common stock in the\nproposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, to be advisable, fair to\nand in the best interests of Maxar and its stockholders, and recommend that Maxar stockholders adopt the\nMerger Agreement, the Board of Directors consulted with Maxar\u2019s senior management team, as well as our\nfinancial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors that\nthe Board of Directors viewed as supporting its decision:\nthe current and historical trading prices of shares of Maxar common stock, and the fact that the\nMerger Consideration of $53.00 per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 129% to the\nclosing price of Maxar common stock as of December 15, 2022, the last trading day prior to the public\nannouncement of the Merger Agreement, a premium of approximately 135% to the volume weighted\naverage price of Maxar common stock over the 60 days prior to the announcement of the Merger\nAgreement and a premium of approximately 34% to the highest price of Maxar common stock over the\n52 weeks prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nthe risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including risks related to\nMaxar\u2019s execution with respect to its WorldView Legion program, Maxar\u2019s need to frequently raise or\nexpend capital due to the capital intensive nature of Maxar\u2019s business, and the difficulty and cost of\nobtaining capital, the risks associated with execution of Maxar\u2019s growth into existing and new\nmarkets, and the difficulty of accurately forecasting customer demand in connection therewith, the\nfact that Maxar conducts a significant amount of its business with governmental entities, and such\nbusiness is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts, and Maxar\u2019s reliance on systems and\nsatellites that are subject to the risks of operating in space and in support of government missions\u037e\nthat the Merger Agreement provides that no effect relating to or arising from Maxar\u2019s WorldView\nLegion satellite program can constitute or contribute to a Company Material Adverse Effect, and the\nconsummation of the Merger is not conditioned on the absence of any such effect or the success of\nthe WorldView Legion program\u037e\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with\ncertainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the closing of the Merger, in comparison to the\nrisks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent value from Maxar\u2019s\nstandalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives

WorldView Legion satellite program, Maxar\u2019s business\nrelationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and\npotential stock price

J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the\nconsideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Maxar or as\nto the underlying decision by Maxar to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nopinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a\nrecommendation to any stockholder of Maxar as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the\nproposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn connection with preparing its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\nreviewed a draft dated December 15, 2022 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Maxar and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of\ncertain transactions involving companies J.P.

Morgan believed necessary or\nappropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all\ninformation that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Maxar or\notherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such\ninformation or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with Maxar, J.P. Morgan\ndid not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct\nor was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate\nthe solvency of Maxar, Parent, Preferred Equity Issuer or Merger Sub under any state or federal laws relating\nto bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P.\nMorgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on\nassumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the\nexpected future results of operations and financial condition of Maxar to which such analyses or forecasts\nrelate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they\nwere based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger\n45 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAgreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement, and that the definitive Merger\nAgreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan.

J.P Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the\nassessments made by advisors to Maxar with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all\nmaterial governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the\nMerger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Maxar or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.\nThe projections furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by Maxar\u2019s management. Maxar does not\npublicly disclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s analysis of the proposed Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward\npublic disclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently\nuncertain and may be beyond the control of Maxar\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors\nrelated to general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual\nresults could vary significantly from those set forth in such projections.

This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and\nreaders of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company Projections.\nThe Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were\nbased are subjective in many respects and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions\nattributable to the dynamics of Maxar\u2019s industry and based on actual experience and business\ndevelopments. The Company Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous\nassumptions with respect to Company performance, industry performance, general business, economic,\nregulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject\nto significant economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond Maxar\u2019s control. The Company\nProjections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and\nuncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements,\u201d that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and\nfor actual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, there can be no assurance\nthat the Company Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower\nthan projected, and the Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results\nand should not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such\ninformation by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Company Projections do not\ntake into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared,\nincluding the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the\npreparation of the Company Projections may have changed since the date the Company Projections were\nprepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional\nsignificant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be\nachieved.\nIn addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results\nafter the date the Company Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of\nMaxar, Advent or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any\nobligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Projections or the specific portions presented to\nreflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in\nthe event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error (except, in the case of Maxar, as\nrequired by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the\nCompany Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nFor the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held more than three months\nafter the Company Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting\ninformation, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Company\nProjections set forth below. The Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the\nhistorical financial statements and other information contained in Maxar\u2019s public filings with the SEC. Maxar\nurges all of its stockholders to review its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial\nresults. See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThe Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public\ndisclosure or toward compliance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d),\npublished guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither KPMG LLP\n(\u201cKPMG\u201d), Maxar\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has\nexamined, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to the Company Projections and, accordingly,\n52 \n(1) \n(2) \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nneither KPMG nor any other accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto. The KPMG report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Maxar\u2019s\nhistorical financial information.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAccordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an\nalternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a\nreconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the Company Projections) in connection\nwith a proposed transaction like the Merger when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy\nstatement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures were not\nrelied upon by J.P. Morgan for purposes of its financial analysis and opinion or by the Board of Directors in\nconnection with its consideration of the Merger. Accordingly, Maxar has not provided a reconciliation of the\nnon-GAAP financial measures included in the Company Projections to the relevant GAAP financial\nmeasures.\nThe Company Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Maxar of\nthe Merger and do not attempt to predict or suggest future results following the Merger. The Company\nProjections do not give effect to the Merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the Merger\nAgreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the Merger, the effect on\nMaxar of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger\nAgreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would\nlikely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered,\naccelerated, postponed, or not taken in anticipation of the Merger. Further, the Company Projections do not\ntake into account the effect on Maxar of any possible failure of the Merger to occur.",

For purposes of clause (1) of the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of\ncommon stock subject to a Maxar PSU will equal (i) for a Maxar PSU granted in 2020, 175% of the target\nnumber of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such Maxar PSU, (ii) for a Maxar PSU granted in 2021,\n176% of the target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such Maxar PSU, and (iii) for a\nMaxar PSU granted in 2022, 184% of the target number of shares of Maxar common stock covered by such\nMaxar PSU.\n2023 Employee RSUs\nFor each 2023 Employee RSU, 33% of the number of shares covered by such 2023 Employee RSU that\nare outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the \u201csingle trigger shares\u201d), whether vested or\nunvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1)\nthe number of single trigger shares and (2) the Merger Consideration, with such payment to be made no later\nthan 10 business days following the Effective Time.

We\nestimate that the value of unvested equity awards held by all executive officers, other than the named\nexecutive officers, that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs on March 10, 2023, and all such\nexecutive officers experience qualifying terminations on that date is $12,931,998. We estimate that the\naggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Maxar that would vest\nassuming that the Merger occurs on March 10, 2023 is $2,076,540.\nExecutive Severance Arrangements\nDaniel L. Jablonsky\nMaxar is party to an amended and restated employment agreement with Daniel L. Jablonsky (the\n\u201cJablonsky Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Jablonsky Agreement, if Mr. Jablonsky experiences a qualifying\ntermination during the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months following a change in\ncontrol, he will be entitled to (1) severance equal to 2.99 times the sum of his then-current base salary plus\nhis target annual bonus for the year of termination, generally payable in a lump sum, (2) accelerated vesting\nof Mr. Jablonsky\u2019s outstanding equity awards, with any performance conditions calculated based upon the\nhigher of actual achievement and prorated target achievement, (3) up to 36 months of continued health\ncoverage for Mr. Jablonsky and his dependents under Maxar\u2019s group health plan, or reimbursement for such\ncosts, and (4) \u201cexecutive package\u201d outplacement services. The foregoing payments are conditional on Mr.\nJablonsky\u2019s executing and not revoking a release of claims agreement with Maxar. Mr. Jablonsky is\nprohibited for a period of one year following termination of employment from competing with Maxar and\nsoliciting Maxar\u2019s employees.\nMessrs. Porter, Scott, Frazier and Lee\nEach of Messrs. Porter, Scott, Frazier and Lee is party to a change in control and severance agreement\nwith Maxar. These agreements provide that, in the case of Messrs. Frazier and Lee, in the event of a\nqualifying termination during the period beginning three months before and ending 24 months following a\nchange in control of Maxar, and, in the case of Messrs. Porter and Scott, in the event of a qualifying\ntermination on or during 24 months following a change in control, the executive officer will be entitled to (1)\nseverance equal to two times the sum of the executive\u2019s then-current base salary plus his target annual\nbonus for the year of termination, generally payable in a lump sum, (2) a lump sum payment equal to 24\nmonths of continued COBRA premiums, (3) \u201cexecutive package\u201d outplacement services, and (4) accelerated\nvesting of the executive\u2019s outstanding equity awards\u037e provided, that, Mr. Porter is only eligible for\naccelerated vesting if he experiences a qualifying termination within the first 12 months following a change in\ncontrol. The foregoing payments are conditional on the executive executing and not revoking a release of\nclaims agreement with Maxar. Each of Messrs. Porter, Scott, Frazier and Lee is prohibited for a period of one\nyear following termination of employment from competing with Maxar and soliciting Maxar\u2019s employees.\nFor an estimate of the value of the severance payments described above that would be payable to\nMaxar\u2019s named executive officers upon a qualifying termination on March 10, 2023, see \u201c- Quantification of\nPayments and Benefits to Maxar\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below. We estimate that the aggregate value of\nseverance payments that would be payable to all Maxar executive officers who are not named executive\nofficers, assuming a qualifying termination on March 10, 2023, is $21,702,338.\nRetention Awards\nIn connection with the Merger, Maxar awarded each named executive officer a one-time cash retention\nbonus. Maxar awarded Mr. Jablonsky a retention bonus of $1,500,000, Mr. Frazier a retention bonus of\n57 \n(1) \na) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$700,000, Mr. Lee a retention bonus of $650,000, Mr. Porter a retention bonus of $500,000 and Mr. Scott a\nretention bonus of $300,000. Each retention bonus will vest with respect to one third of the award upon the\nEffective Time and with respect to the remaining two thirds of the award on the one year anniversary of the\nEffective Time, subject to the recipient\u2019s continued employment through the applicable vesting date (or such\nrecipient\u2019s earlier qualifying termination). The estimated aggregate amount of retention bonuses that will be\npayable to all Maxar executive officers who are not named executive officers is $1,390,000.\nIndemnification Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Maxar\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled\nto certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the effective time under\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and\ninsurance coverage is further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fIndemnification and\nInsurance.\u201d\nNew Compensation Arrangements\nAny executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are\nretained to provide services to the Surviving Corporation may enter into new individualized compensation\narrangements and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent,\nany of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation\narrangements between such persons and the Surviving Corporation and/or its affiliates have been\nestablished or discussed.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to Maxar\u2019s Named Executive Officers\nThe table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Maxar\u2019s named executive\nofficers would receive in connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and\neach such named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination on March 10, 2023 (which is the\nassumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure)\u037e (ii) a per share price of\nMaxar ordinary shares of $53\u037e (iii) that each named executive officer\u2019s base salary rate and annual target\nbonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of the date of this proxy statement\u037e and (iv) equity awards\nthat are outstanding as of March 10, 2023. The calculations in the table below do not include any amounts\nthat the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were vested as of the date hereof. In\naddition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may\noccur prior to the Effective Time or any awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of the Merger prior to\nMarch 10, 2023. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual\namounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth\nbelow.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nNamed Executive Officer\nCash ($)\nEquity \nAwards ($)\nBenefits ($)\nTotal ($)\nDaniel L.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under\nthe DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any\nlegal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Maxar stockholders exercise their\nappraisal rights under Section 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder,\u201d\n\u201cholder of shares of Maxar common stock\u201d or \u201cMaxar stockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of\nMaxar common stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Maxar\ncommon stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person\nhaving a beneficial interest in shares of Maxar common stock held of record in the name of another person,\nsuch as a bank, broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or custodian), depository or other nominee,\nmust act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely\nmanner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Maxar common stock through a bank, broker or other\nnominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, Maxar stockholders who: (a) submit a written demand for\nappraisal of their shares\u037e (b) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (c) continuously\nare the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (d) otherwise exactly follow the\nprocedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Maxar common stock, exclusive\nof any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest\nto be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss\nappraisal proceedings as to all Maxar stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless (i) the total\nnumber of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding\nshares of Maxar common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e\n62 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Maxar common stock for\nwhich appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (i) and (ii) which are\nreferred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion,\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound\nquarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any\ntime before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving\nCorporation may voluntarily pay to each Maxar stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant\nto subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only\non an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nshares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time\nof such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation\nto make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, such as\nthe Special Meeting, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its\nstockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which\nappraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section\n262. This proxy statement constitutes Maxar\u2019s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in\nconnection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.\nIn connection with the Merger, any Maxar stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who\nwishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review this discussion and Annex C carefully. Failure\nto strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss\nof appraisal rights under the DGCL. A Maxar stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be\nentitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the\ncomplexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Maxar common stock,\nMaxar believes that if a Maxar stockholder considers exercising such rights, that Maxar stockholder should\nseek the advice of legal counsel.\nMaxar stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Maxar common\nstock must do ALL of the following:\nthe Maxar stockholder must not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e\nthe Maxar stockholder must deliver to Maxar a written demand for appraisal before the vote by the\nMaxar stockholders is taken on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting\u037e\nthe Maxar stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Maxar common stock from the date of\nmaking the demand through the Effective Time (a Maxar stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the\nMaxar stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\nthe Maxar stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Maxar common stock\nheld either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation\nmust file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of\nthe shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation\nto file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement, a Maxar stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its\nshares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny Maxar stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Maxar, before the vote on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will be submitted to Maxar stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such Maxar\nstockholder\u2019s shares, and that Maxar stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of\n63 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Merger Agreement. A Maxar stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on\nthe date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the\nEffective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be\nvoted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the Maxar\nstockholder\u2019s appraisal rights. Therefore, a Maxar stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or\nfailing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written\ndemand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in\naddition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote\nagainst the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A Maxar stockholder\u2019s failure to\nmake the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the\nSpecial Meeting of Maxar stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Maxar common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the\nshares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Maxar common stock\nmust be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Maxar of the identity\nof the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in\nconnection with the Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such\nas by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner,\nand if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common,\nthe demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an\nauthorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of\nrecord\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in\nexecuting the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nMAXAR STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR\nOTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT\nWITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES TO MAKE A DEMAND\nFOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD\nOF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE,\nMUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY\nMANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be in writing and should be mailed or\ndelivered to:\nMaxar Technologies Inc. \nAttention: James C. Lee, Corporate Secretary \n1300 West 120th Avenue \nWestminster, Colorado 80234\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Maxar stockholder who has delivered a written\ndemand to Maxar and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named\nparty may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering to\nMaxar a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand\nmade more than 60 days after the Effective Time shall require written approval of the Surviving Corporation.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any Maxar stockholder\nwithout the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such\nterms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect\nthe right of any Maxar stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such Maxar stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nMerger Consideration within 60 days after the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and\nMaxar, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when\nthat approval is required, or, except with respect to any Maxar stockholder who\n64 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwithdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding\nsentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with\nrespect to a Maxar stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value\ndetermined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the\nMerger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify\neach Maxar stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and\nwho has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective\nand the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any Maxar\nstockholder who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including\nfor this purpose any beneficial owner of shares of Maxar common stock held either in a voting trust or by\nnominee on behalf of such person) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed\nby a Maxar stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held\nby all dissenting Maxar stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation,\nand has no present intention, to file a petition, and Maxar stockholders should not assume that the Surviving\nCorporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of\nMaxar common stock. Accordingly, any Maxar stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised\nshould initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Maxar\ncommon stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a Maxar\nstockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the Maxar\nstockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any Maxar stockholder who has complied with the\nrequirements of Section 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written\nrequest, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares\nof Maxar common stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to\nwhich Maxar has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The\nSurviving Corporation must mail such statement to the requesting Maxar stockholder within 10 days after\nreceipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the\nexpiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares\nof Maxar common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such\nperson\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement\ndescribed in this paragraph. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a\nMaxar stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a Maxar stockholder or a beneficial owner and a copy\nthereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20\ndays after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all Maxar stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition\nbe mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the Maxar stockholders shown on such verified list at the\naddresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing\nin a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another\npublication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of these notices are borne by the\nSurviving Corporation. After notice to Maxar stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of\nChancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those Maxar stockholders who\nhave complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may require Maxar stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to\n65 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsubmit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of\nthe appraisal proceedings and, if any Maxar stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may dismiss that Maxar stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of\nChancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Maxar stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights\nunless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining the Maxar stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership\nthresholds described above has been satisfied as to Maxar stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the\nappraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Maxar common stock, exclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any,\nto be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any\nvoluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 that\nhave the effect of limiting the sum on which interest accrues as described below). In determining fair value,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of\nthe judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and\nthe date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters\njudgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each Maxar stockholder\nentitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment\nonly on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nshares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time\nof such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise\nadmissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all\nrelevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this\ndetermination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects,\nthe nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that\nthrow any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be\n\u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede &\nCo. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that]\ndoes not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of\nvalue arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also\nstated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible\nof proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nMaxar stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as\nso determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the\nconsideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and\nthat an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, and Maxar stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a\ndetermination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Maxar nor Parent\nanticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Maxar stockholder exercising appraisal\nrights, and each of Maxar and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to\nsubsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262,\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Maxar common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for\nappraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as\nto Maxar stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease.\n66 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of\nexperts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a Maxar\nstockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by\na Maxar stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and\nthe fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to be\nappraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any Maxar stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Maxar common stock under\nSection 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the Maxar\nstockholder\u2019s shares of Maxar common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time\ninto the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. A Maxar stockholder will fail to perfect,\nor effectively lose or withdraw, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120\ndays after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met or if the Maxar\nstockholder properly delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no Maxar stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be\nentitled to vote such shares of Maxar common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or\nother distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Maxar\ncommon stock, if any, payable to Maxar stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for\nan appraisal is filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above is met, or if the Maxar\nstockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written\napproval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such Maxar stockholder to an appraisal will cease.\nOnce a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding\nmay not be dismissed as to any Maxar stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may\nbe conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not\naffect the right of any Maxar stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such Maxar stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a\nMaxar stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Maxar stockholder wishing to exercise\nappraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

This discussion is\nlimited to U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Maxar common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to, as amended, as the\n\u201cCode\u201d) (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences with respect to holders other than U.S. Holders. This discussion is based upon the Code,\nTreasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal\nRevenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this\nproxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements\nand conclusions set forth in this discussion.

A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.\nHolder paid for the shares of Maxar common stock. Any gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain\nor loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the\ncompletion of the Merger.

At or prior to the\nEffective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, to be held in trust for\nthe benefit of the holders of the shares of Maxar common stock (other than Unconverted Shares), cash in\nU.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the\nshares of Maxar common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the\nUnconverted Shares) (which we refer to as the \u201cPayment Fund\u201d). The Paying Agent will invest any cash\nincluded in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger\nAgreement. If for any reason (including investment losses) at any time the cash in the Payment Fund is\ninsufficient to make prompt payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent will\npromptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to such deficiency. Any interest\nand other income resulting from such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation, as Parent\ndirects.\nPromptly after the Effective Time (and after receipt by the Paying Agent from Maxar\u2019s transfer agent of\nall information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agent to effect the mailing, provided that Parent\nand the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable best efforts to obtain such information to enable such\nmailing to occur no later than the fifth business day following the Effective Time), Parent or the Surviving\nCorporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of an outstanding certificate (which\nwe refer to as a \u201cCertificate\u201d), if any, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding\nshares of Maxar common stock, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be\neffected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper\ndelivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of\nsuch Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a\nCertificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed\nin accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in\nexchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Maxar common stock formerly represented by\nsuch Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled.\nThe Paying Agent will issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated shares of Maxar common stock\nrepresented by book entry (which we refer to as \u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d) not held, directly or indirectly,\nthrough The Depository Trust Company (which we refer to as \u201cDTC\u201d), if any, the Merger Consideration for\neach such Book-Entry Share, upon receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Paying Agent (or such other\nevidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), and such Book-Entry Shares will\nthen be cancelled.
