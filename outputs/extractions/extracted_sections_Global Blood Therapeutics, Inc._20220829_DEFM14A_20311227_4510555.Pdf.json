In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to\nyou by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the GBT\nstockholder of record.

You may still\nattend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.\nPlease be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the\nInternet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy\ncard, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be\nresponsible.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your\nbank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,\nbroker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically\nover the Internet or by telephone.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is a GBT stockholder\u2019s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such GBT\nstockholder on their behalf. If you are a GBT stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by\ntelephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares\nbeneficially in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other\nnominee.\nQ:\nIf a GBT stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process\nor the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting\non all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement\nProposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d, will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to\nbe considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You\nshould follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without\ninstructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted\nagainst the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nCompensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?\nA:\nYes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this proxy\nstatement. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy by any of the\nfollowing actions:\n\u2022\nYou may vote again over the Internet or by telephone as instructed on your proxy card before the closing\nof the voting facilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022.\n\u2022\nYou may submit another properly signed proxy card with a later date, provided such proxy card is received\nno later than the close of business on September 29, 2022.\n\u2022\nYou may send a signed written notice that you are revoking your proxy to GBT\u2019s Secretary at 181 Oyster\nPoint Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080, provided such written notice is received no later than the\nclose of business on September 29, 2022.\n\u2022\nYou may attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat. Simply attending the virtual Special Meeting will not,\nby itself, revoke your proxy.\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you hold your shares of GBT common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you should contact your bank, broker or other\nnominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the\nSpecial Meeting website.\nIf you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nShareholders may call toll-free: 1 (877) 825-8793\nBanks and Brokers may call collect: 1 (212) 750-5833\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nThis means you own shares of GBT common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than\none account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a GBT stockholder of record and other shares\nthrough a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive\nmultiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions\nfor any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares\nyou own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by\nmail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address\nwith another GBT stockholder?\nA:\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for\nproxy statements with respect to two or more GBT stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single\nproxy statement to those GBT stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding\u201d,\npotentially provides extra convenience for GBT stockholders and cost savings for companies.\nGBT and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to\nmultiple GBT stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected GBT stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding\nand would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of\nthese documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your\nbroker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or GBT if you are a GBT stockholder of record by making a\nrequest to our Secretary at 181 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080 or by calling (650) 741-\n7700. In addition, GBT will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number\nabove, a separate copy of the proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In\naddition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, GBT will file the final voting\nresults of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results)\nwith the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nGBT has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting.\nGBT expects to pay Innisfree M&A Incorporated a fee of $37,500, plus certain costs associated with additional\nservices, as necessary, and Innisfree M&A Incorporated will be reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket fees and\nexpenses. GBT has agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against various liabilities and expenses\nthat relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).\nGBT also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective\nagents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of GBT common stock. GBT\ndirectors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They\nwill not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the Merger as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of\ncompletion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified\nin the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control. For\nmore information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to\nthe Closing of the Merger\u201d.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about GBT?\nA:\nGBT will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022 Annual\nReport to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,\nwithout charge to any GBT stockholder who makes a request in writing or by telephone to GBT\u2019s Investor\nRelations Department at 181 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080 or (650) 741-7700.

If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nEach \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a\nquorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A\n20TABLE OF CONTENTS\nso-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a\nmatter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular\nproposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific\nvoting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. GBT does not expect any broker non-votes at the\nSpecial Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with\ndiscretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered \u201croutine\u201d, whereas each of the proposals to be\npresented at the Special Meeting is considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your\nshares of GBT common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on\nhow to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal.\nStock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons",

            "text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Company\u2019s management and the Board regularly review the Company\u2019s performance and prospects in light of its\nbusiness and developments in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. These reviews have included\nconsideration, from time to time, of potential partnerships, collaborations and other strategic transactions to enhance\nstockholder value, including potential sale transactions. Such reviews have been accompanied by periodic\nconversations between senior executives of the Company and their counterparts at other companies in such\nindustries regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.\nOn May 26, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted Dr. Ted W. Love, the Company\u2019s President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, to schedule time to speak. The representative of Company A and Dr. Love spoke on June 2, 2022\nand proposed a meeting between Dr. Love and representatives of Company A. On June 6, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms.\nJung E. Choi, the Company\u2019s Chief Business and Strategy Officer, met with representatives of Company A. During\nthis meeting, the representatives of Company A provided a letter containing a non-binding proposal to acquire 100%\nof the Company\u2019s equity for $55.00 per share of GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 6\nCompany A Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 111% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common\nstock of $26.11 on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the June 6 Company A Proposal. The offer letter stated\nthat its submission had the support of Company A\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nOn June 7, 2022, management of the Company apprised the Board of the June 6 Company A Proposal and a Board\nmeeting was scheduled for June 8, 2022 to discuss the June 6 Company A Proposal.\nOn June 8, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, a financial\nadvisor to the Company, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (which we refer to as \u201cCravath\u201d) and Goodwin Procter\nLLP (which we refer to as \u201cGoodwin\u201d), outside counsel to the Company, met virtually to discuss, among other topics,\nthe June 6 Company A Proposal. Dr. Love described to the Board his interactions with representatives of Company A\nprior to and following the receipt of the June 6 Company A Proposal. Members of management briefed the Board on\nthe Company\u2019s ongoing assessment of its long-range plans, which would be further discussed at the September 2022\nstrategic retreat, and the Company\u2019s next steps in light of its receipt of the June 6 Company A Proposal.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan provided a market overview and their preliminary view of the June 6 Company A\nProposal, and representatives of Cravath reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties and other\nlegal matters. The Board determined to continue to consider the June 6 Company A Proposal, following a preliminary\nfinancial analysis to be performed prior to the next Board meeting.\nOn June 8, 2022, the Company selected Centerview as an additional financial advisor to the Company (we refer to J.P.\nMorgan and Centerview, collectively, as \u201cthe Company\u2019s financial advisors\u201d).\nOn June 14, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of Cravath and Goodwin, met\nvirtually for a regularly scheduled meeting during which, among other topics, the June 6 Company A Proposal was\ndiscussed. At the meeting, a representative of Cravath reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties\nand other legal matters. The Board and representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors discussed, along with\nmembers of management and representatives of Cravath and Goodwin, among other topics, the June 6 Company A\nProposal and certain strategic considerations in connection with a potential sale transaction, as well as an overview\nof other potential acquirors of the Company. Representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors presented their\npreliminary financial review of the June 6 Company A Proposal based on preliminary financial projections provided\nby management. Following discussion, the Board authorized the Company\u2019s management, with the assistance of its\nfinancial and legal advisors, to inform Company A that the June 6 Company A Proposal was insufficient from a\nfinancial perspective. However, the Board authorized the Company\u2019s management, with the assistance of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors, to provide Company A with limited high-level information, upon execution of the\nconfidentiality agreement, in order to enable Company A to improve its offer price. The Board also authorized the\nCompany\u2019s management, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, to solicit interest from additional\npotential acquirors to gauge their interest in a potential transaction with the Company and, if a potential acquiror of\nthe Company indicated an interest in a potential transaction with the Company, to send such potential acquiror a\ndraft confidentiality agreement and,\n27TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nonce entered into, commence discussions with such potential acquiror. In order to facilitate the Board providing\nguidance to the Company\u2019s management during the negotiations of the potential sale transaction, the Board adopted\nresolutions forming a transaction committee (which we refer to as the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d), consisting of Scott\nMorrison, Mark Perry and Dawn Svoronos. The Board decided that, while the Transaction Committee would be\ncomprised of three members of the Board, all Board members would be invited to, and strongly encouraged to\nparticipate in, any and all meetings of the Transaction Committee. Over the next several weeks, in addition to formal\nBoard meetings, Dr. Love and other members of the Company\u2019s senior management periodically briefed and received\ninput from several Board members as to the discussions with representatives of certain of the potential acquirors.\nOn June 15, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms. Choi met virtually with representatives of Company A. Dr. Love informed the\nrepresentatives of Company A that the Board had determined that the June 6 Company A Proposal was insufficient\nfrom a financial perspective, but that, following the execution by Company A of a confidentiality agreement, Dr. Love\nand a limited number of other senior management of the Company would make themselves available for a\nconversation to help Company A learn about the Company in order to facilitate an increase in Company A\u2019s offer\nprice. The representatives of Company A informed the Company that Company A would send a diligence request list\nthat would help Company A better understand the value of the Company.\nLater on June 15, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors provided a\nconfidentiality agreement to Company A, which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of\nthe Company, Company A, Cravath and Company A\u2019s outside counsel. The confidentiality agreement between the\nCompany and Company A was executed on June 18, 2022.\nOn June 16, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors spoke\ntelephonically with representatives of Pfizer to ask whether they would be interested in exploring a potential\nacquisition of the Company. The following day, representatives of Pfizer contacted representatives of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisors to ask whether they could receive a management presentation. Following this conversation, at the\ndirection of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors provided a confidentiality agreement to\nPfizer, which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of the Company, Pfizer and Cravath.\nThe confidentiality agreement between the Company and Pfizer was executed on June 27, 2022.\nOn June 17, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors spoke\ntelephonically with representatives of Company B to ask whether they would be interested in exploring a potential\nacquisition of the Company. The following day, representatives of Company B contacted representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors to ask whether they could receive a management presentation. Following this\nconversation, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors provided a\nconfidentiality agreement to representatives of Company B, which was negotiated over the next several days among\nrepresentatives of the Company, Company B and Cravath. The confidentiality agreement between the Company and\nCompany B was executed on June 26, 2022. All of the executed confidentiality agreements contained standstill\nprovisions, which automatically terminated upon the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nBetween June 15 and June 17, 2022, management spoke telephonically with one potential acquiror, and\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors, at the direction of the Board, contacted two other potential\nacquirors, in each case that had been reviewed with the Board at the June 14 Board Meeting, all of whom declined to\npursue a potential acquisition of the Company.\nBetween June 24 and June 28, 2022, representatives of Pfizer, Company A and Company B separately met virtually\nwith the Company\u2019s management for a presentation on, among other things, clinical, regulatory and commercial\ninformation in respect of Oxbryta and the Company\u2019s product candidates, GBT601 and inclacumab, as well as an\noverview of the Company\u2019s research programs.\nOn June 28, 2022, Dr. Love met virtually with a representative of Company A to discuss, among other things, the\nmechanisms of action of the Company\u2019s products and product candidates.\nOn June 29, 2022, representatives of Company A called Dr. Love and Ms. Choi to request that Company A be\npermitted to conduct full due diligence, including being granted access to a virtual data room. In connection with\nsuch request, Company A delivered a revised non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nequity of the Company for $60.00 per share of GBT common stock, which offer was subsequently delivered to the\nCompany in writing (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 29 Company A Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 101%\npremium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $29.84 on June 28, 2022, the last trading day prior to\nthe June 29 Company A Proposal.\nOn July 5, 2022, the Transaction Committee, along with other members of the Board and management as well as\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to consider and discuss,\namong other things, the June 29 Company A Proposal and the status of discussions with other potential acquirors.\nDr. Love provided the Transaction Committee with an overview of the discussions with Company A and the outreach\nto other potential acquirors, including Pfizer and Company B, that had occurred since the prior Board meeting on\nJune 14, 2022. Representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors also briefed the Transaction Committee on the\noutreach efforts since the prior Board meeting and indicated that the other potential acquirors had declined to engage\nin further discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company. Representatives of the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors presented certain preliminary financial analyses of the June 29 Company A Proposal. Following discussion,\nthe Transaction Committee determined that the Company would permit Company A to commence further due\ndiligence to enable it to further improve its offer price. The Transaction Committee and other participating Board\nmembers directed the Company\u2019s financial advisors to inform Company A that the June 29 Company A Proposal was\nstill insufficient from a financial perspective, but that the Company would grant Company A full diligence access to\nthe Company\u2019s virtual data room in order to enable Company A to improve its offer price. Additionally, the\nTransaction Committee directed the Company\u2019s financial advisors to continue to seek offers from Pfizer and Company\nB as a condition to such parties conducting further due diligence.\nOn July 6, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms. Choi met virtually with representatives of Company A. Dr. Love informed the\nrepresentatives of Company A that the June 29 Company A Proposal was insufficient from a financial perspective,\nbut that the Company would allow Company A to conduct further due diligence, with the expectation that Company\nA would increase its offer price following its due diligence review. The next day, Company A was granted access to a\nvirtual data room established by the Company.\nOn July 6, 2022, representatives of Pfizer spoke telephonically with representatives of the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors to share a preliminary list of high-priority diligence questions in order to further assess Pfizer\u2019s potential\ninterest in an acquisition of the Company. The next day, Dr. Love met virtually with several representatives of Pfizer to\ndiscuss, among other things, certain of such diligence questions.\nOn July 11, 2022, representatives of Pfizer provided a letter to Dr. Love containing a non-binding proposal to acquire\n100% of the Company\u2019s equity for $53.00 per share of GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 11\nPfizer Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 52% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of\n$34.85 on July 8, 2022, the last trading day prior to the July 11 Pfizer Proposal. The offer letter stated that Pfizer\u2019s\nexecutive leadership strongly supported the proposal and proposed three weeks of due diligence to be conducted\nconcurrently with negotiation of a definitive merger agreement. The same day, the Company\u2019s management provided\nthe Board with a copy of the offer letter from Pfizer, and Pfizer was granted access to the virtual data room in order to\nenable Pfizer to improve its offer price.\nOn July 12, 2022, representatives of Company B provided a letter to representatives of the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors containing a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the Company\u2019s equity for $50.50 per share of GBT\ncommon stock in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 12 Company B Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 50%\npremium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.71 on July 11, 2022, the last trading day prior to\nthe July 12 Company B Proposal. The offer letter proposed six to eight weeks of due diligence upon access to the\nCompany\u2019s management and the virtual data room, but, unlike Pfizer and Company A, did not indicate engagement by\nCompany B of financial or legal advisors.\nOn July 13, 2022, after consultation with management of the Company, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors informed representatives of Company B that the July 12 Company B Proposal was insufficient both from a\nfinancial perspective and regarding the time to completion of diligence and that Company B would need to submit a\nrevised offer with improved terms in order for the Company to grant Company B access to the virtual data room.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDuring the following weeks, Pfizer and Company A conducted their respective due diligence investigations of the\nCompany. Representatives of the Company continued to meet virtually with representatives of Pfizer and Company A\nto discuss certain diligence items.\nOn July 18, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Company A\u2019s outside\ncounsel and to representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Pfizer\u2019s legal counsel (which we refer to as\n\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d). The initial draft included, among other things, a proposed termination fee, which would be\npayable by the Company upon the occurrence of certain events, including the Company\u2019s termination of the merger\nagreement to accept a superior proposal (which we refer to as a \u201ccompany termination fee\u201d), of 1.50% of transaction\nequity value.\nOn July 20, 2022, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors spoke telephonically with representatives of\nPfizer to discuss, among other things, Pfizer\u2019s desire to execute a definitive agreement by early August and the status\nof Pfizer\u2019s due diligence process. During the conversation, the representative of Pfizer informed representatives of\nthe Company\u2019s financial advisors that Pfizer would send a revised offer in the coming days.\nOn July 22, 2022, representatives of Company B provided a letter to representatives of the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors containing a revised non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the Company\u2019s equity for $58.00 per share of\nGBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 22 Company B Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a\n67% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $34.82 on July 21, 2022, the last trading day\nprior to the July 22 Company B Proposal. The revised offer letter proposed three weeks of due diligence upon access\nto the Company\u2019s management and the virtual data room, and, consistent with its prior offer letter, did not indicate\nengagement by Company B of financial or legal advisors.\nOver the next two days, Company B was granted access to the virtual data room in order to enable Company B to\nimprove its offer price and representatives of Cravath sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Company B.\nThe terms of such draft merger agreement were identical to the terms of the draft merger agreements previously sent\nto representatives of Company A\u2019s outside counsel and to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. During the following\nweeks, Company B conducted its due diligence investigation of the Company, although no external advisors were\ninvolved in any of the interactions. Representatives of the Company continued to meet virtually with representatives\nof Company B to discuss certain diligence items, however, its level of engagement was not comparable to that of\nPfizer or Company A.\nOn July 26, 2022, representatives of Pfizer provided a letter to Dr. Love containing a revised non-binding proposal to\nacquire 100% of the Company\u2019s equity for $60.00 in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 26 Pfizer Proposal\u201d), which\nproposal represented a 79% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.52 on July 25, 2022,\nthe last trading day prior to the July 26 Pfizer Proposal. The revised letter provided that Pfizer\u2019s due diligence review\nwas substantially complete, and noted that Pfizer was prepared to move expeditiously to sign a definitive merger\nagreement and announce the transaction within a week.\nShortly after the submission of the letter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Cravath. The draft included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 4.00% of\ntransaction equity value.\nOn July 27, 2022, the Transaction Committee, along with each other member of the Board, members of management\nand representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to discuss, among other\ntopics, the progress of the proposed transaction to date, including the revised offer and revised draft merger\nagreement from Pfizer and the status of the bids from Company A and Company B. Management of the Company and\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors reviewed with the Transaction Committee the Company\u2019s\ninteractions with Pfizer, Company A and Company B since the prior Transaction Committee meeting on July 5, 2022.\nThe Transaction Committee then discussed with the Company\u2019s management and representatives of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisors and Cravath the potential for the Company to obtain increased offers from each of the potential\nacquirors, relative timelines and relative certainty of execution and closing with each of the potential acquirors, taking\ninto account each potential acquiror\u2019s progress in the diligence and negotiation processes to date and timeline to\nexecution of a definitive agreement as well as regulatory considerations.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on July 27, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors informed\nrepresentatives of Company A\u2019s financial advisor that the Company was engaged in discussions with other potential\nacquirors.\nOn July 28, 2022, representatives of Company A\u2019s outside counsel sent a revised draft merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Cravath.

The offer letter stated that Company A had completed due diligence and secured all\napprovals (including approval from its board of directors) necessary to execute the merger agreement. The offer letter\nindicated that the August 5 Company A Proposal was not subject to any financing requirements and that Company A\nwas prepared to execute a definitive merger agreement on or before August 7, 2022. The offer letter requested that, if\nthe Company elected to move forward with the August 5 Company A Proposal, the Company enter into a customary\nexclusivity agreement providing for exclusive negotiations until 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on August 8, 2022.

Representatives of Company A subsequently indicated to Dr. Love that Company A would be\nwilling to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of the Company for $65.00 per share of GBT common stock in cash\n(which we refer to as the \u201cRevised August 5 Company A Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 92% premium to\nthe closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.93 on August 3, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior\nto public market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company. Following that subsequent discussion,\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors contacted representatives of Pfizer to inform them that the\nCompany had received a competing proposal from another party that was not that far apart in terms of value, and that\nPfizer should also consider improving the terms of its draft merger agreement.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt noon, Pacific Time, on August 5, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to discuss, among other topics, the August 5\nPfizer Proposal and the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal.

Representatives of Cravath compared the terms of the draft merger agreements submitted by Pfizer and\nCompany A, including the closing conditions and certain regulatory matters. The Board and representatives of\nCravath discussed the August 5 Pfizer Proposal and the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal, including that the\nAugust 5 Pfizer Proposal included a higher price per share of GBT common stock than the Revised August 5\nCompany A Proposal, while the merger agreement submitted by Company A was generally more favorable to the\nCompany than the merger agreement submitted by Pfizer with respect to regulatory matters and the closing\nconditions. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed with the Board certain employee retention, compensation and\nbenefits-related matters in the draft merger agreements submitted by Pfizer and Company A, including that the\nRevised August 5 Company A Proposal contemplated that all Company PSUs would be cashed out at the maximum\nlevel, while the August 5 Pfizer Proposal contemplated that Company PSUs based on patient share and total\nstockholder return would be cashed out at the greater of target and actual performance (as of the closing of the\nproposed transaction) and Company PSUs based on the price of GBT common stock would be canceled upon\nconsummation of the proposed transaction. Further, the Board was advised that Company B had not engaged in any\ninteractions with the Company\u2019s management or advisors regarding price or contract terms since the last update to\nthe Board. Following such discussion, the Board directed the Company\u2019s management, with the assistance of its\nfinancial and legal advisors, to seek a revised offer from each of Pfizer and Company A.\nAfter the noon Board meeting, Dr. Love contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to seek an increase in\nCompany A\u2019s offer price. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A indicated that the $65.00 price per share of GBT\ncommon stock contained in the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal was likely the highest price that Company A\nwas willing to pay to acquire the Company. In addition, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors separately contacted representatives of Pfizer and Company A to discuss each of their\nproposals. During these discussions, representatives of Company A indicated to representatives of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisors that they were uncertain of their ability to increase their offer above the $65.00 price per share of\nGBT common stock contained in the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal.

Representatives\nof Company A confirmed that the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal represented Company A\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d\noffer.

Subsequent to this conversation, representatives of\nPfizer indicated to representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors that, provided the Company was willing to\nsign a definitive merger agreement substantially on the terms Pfizer had last presented, Pfizer would increase its offer\nto $68.50 per share of GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cRevised August 5 Pfizer Proposal\u201d),\nwhich represented a 102% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.93 on August 3, 2022,\nthe last trading day that closed prior to public market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company.\nAdditionally, representatives of Pfizer indicated that Pfizer was prepared to execute the definitive merger agreement\nby August 6, 2022.\nFollowing those discussions, the Board meeting was reconvened.

The Board considered the\ncurrent and historical market prices of GBT common stock, including the market performance of GBT\ncommon stock relative to those of other participants in the Company\u2019s industry and general market indices,\nand the fact that the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock represented a:\n\u2022\n102% premium to the unaffected trading price at which GBT common stock closed on August 3, 2022,\nthe last trading day that closed prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the\nCompany\u037e\n\u2022\n110% premium to the volume weighted average price for GBT common stock over the 30-trading day\nperiod ended August 3, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior to published market speculation\nregarding a potential sale of the Company\u037e and\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\n70% premium to the highest closing price in the 52-week period ended August 3, 2022, the last trading\nday that closed prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is\nall cash, which will provide GBT stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of\nGBT common stock, enables GBT stockholders to realize value that has been created by GBT and does not\nexpose them to any future risks related to the business or macroeconomic conditions (including the\nCOVID-19 pandemic), as compared to GBT remaining independent (especially when viewed against the\npotential risks and uncertainties inherent in GBT\u2019s business, including risks related to obtaining marketing\napprovals for products and the timing of regulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing,\nlabeling, pricing and market acceptance of product candidates).\n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition. The Board considered the fact that Pfizer and Merger Sub would have sufficient\ncash resources to pay the amounts required to be paid under the Merger Agreement and that the Merger is\nnot subject to a financing condition.\n\u2022\nSale Process. The Board considered the fact that it had engaged in extensive discussions regarding\nstrategic options and potential acquirors with the Company\u2019s management and representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors. In particular, the process conducted by the Board, with the assistance of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors, involved contacting, or responding to, six potential acquirors, entering into\nnon-disclosure agreements with and providing management presentations and granting due diligence\naccess to three potential acquirors, receiving non-binding offers from three potential acquirors and\nreceiving two final proposals, one of which was from Pfizer. The Board also considered the fact that the\nmedia coverage regarding GBT\u2019s discussions with potentially interested parties did not result in any\noutreach or proposals from any new potential acquirors. For a detailed discussion of the sale process,\nplease see above under the heading entitled \u201c-Background of the Merger\u201d.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s Operating and Financial Condition and Prospects. The Board considered the\nCompany\u2019s operating and financial performance and its prospects, including certain prospective forecasts\nfor the Company prepared by the Company\u2019s senior management, which reflect an application of various\nassumptions of senior management. The Board considered the inherent uncertainty of achieving senior\nmanagement\u2019s prospective forecasts, as set forth under the heading entitled \u201c-Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d, and that as a result the Company\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ\nmaterially from senior management\u2019s forecasts.\n\u2022\nBest Strategic Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. After a thorough review of strategic\nalternatives and discussions with management and the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors, the Board\ndetermined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the\npotential value that might result from other strategic options available, including, but not limited to,\nremaining a standalone public company. The Board also carefully evaluated, with the assistance of legal\nand financial advisors and members of management, the risks and potential benefits associated with other\nstrategic or financial alternatives and the potential for shareholder value creation associated with those\nalternatives. As part of these evaluations, the Board considered:\n\u2022\nan assessment of the Company\u2019s business, assets (including commercial-stage and pipeline assets),\nprospects, competitive position, regulatory landscape, historical and projected financial performance,\nshort- and long-term capital needs and the nature of the industries in which the Company competes\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with the Company\u2019s business and remaining a standalone public company,\nincluding (i) the results of the Company\u2019s commercialization of Oxbryta, (ii) obtaining marketing\napprovals for Oxbryta in additional indications or in additional jurisdictions and (iii) the timing of\nregulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing, labeling, pricing and market acceptance of\nthe Company\u2019s product candidates.\n\u2022\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s and Centerview\u2019s Respective Fairness Opinions and Related Financial Analyses. The\nBoard considered (i) the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Board on August 7, 2022, which was\nsubsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndate and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in connection with its opinion, the\nMerger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to GBT stockholders (other\nthan as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders and (ii) the oral opinion of Centerview rendered to the Board on August 7, 2022,\nwhich was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such\ndate and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its\nopinion, the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to GBT\nstockholders (other than Excluded Shares (as defined in such opinion)) pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion\nand Centerview\u2019s opinion, please see below in \u201c-Opinion of J.P. Morgan\u201d and \u201c-Opinion of Centerview\u201d.\nThe written opinions delivered by J.P. Morgan and Centerview are attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B and Annex C, respectively.\n\u2022\nNegotiation Process. The Board considered its belief that, after extensive negotiations, the Company\nobtained the highest price that Pfizer is willing to pay for the Company, as evidenced by the Company\u2019s\nability to increase the Merger Consideration relative to Pfizer\u2019s initial offer of $53.00 per share of GBT\ncommon stock. The Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger were the result of robust arm\u2019s-\nlength negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge of and at the direction of the Board,\nwith the assistance of experienced financial and legal advisors and in the context of a competitive process.\nFor a detailed discussion of the negotiation process, please see above under the heading entitled \u201c-\nBackground of the Merger\u201d.\n\u2022\nTiming of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Merger\nand concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The\nBoard also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the\nperiod during which GBT\u2019s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related\ndisruption.\n\u2022\nProduct Development, Commercialization and Regulatory Risks. The Board considered the risks\ninherent in the research, development, regulatory review and potential future commercialization of the\nCompany\u2019s product candidates, and the risks related to market acceptance of such product candidates, if\napproved, and other factors potentially impacting the revenues and profitability of biotechnology and\npharmaceutical products generally. The Board also considered the uncertainty associated with market\ndemand, pricing, governmental reimbursement and other factors beyond the control of the Company with\nrespect to Oxbryta and the Company\u2019s product candidates in the Company\u2019s pipeline.\n\u2022\nBusiness Reputation of Pfizer. The Board considered the business reputation and capabilities of Pfizer and\nits management and the substantial financial resources of Pfizer, which the Board believed supported the\nconclusion that a transaction with Pfizer could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner.\nThe Board also considered Pfizer\u2019s expertise in rare hematology and Pfizer\u2019s logistical and financial abilities\nto build on the parties\u2019 shared commitment to and engagement with the SCD community.\n\u2022\nExisting Resources. The Board considered the fact that the Company may require additional capital in\norder to complete the remaining clinical development for its product candidates and to potentially\ncommercialize these product candidates, as well as fund its other ongoing operations. The Board also took\ninto consideration that, while the Company may seek additional funding through future debt and equity\nfinancing or additional collaborations or strategic partnerships, any such fundraising could be dilutive to\nthe Company\u2019s existing stockholders, might be available only on unfavorable terms or might not be\navailable at all.\n\u2022\nNo Vote of Pfizer Stockholders. The Board considered the fact that the Merger is not subject to the\nconditionality and execution risk of any required approval by Pfizer\u2019s stockholders.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger\nAgreement, including:\n\u2022\nthat the Company may, subject to certain conditions, furnish, pursuant to entry into an acceptable\nconfidentiality agreement, confidential information with respect to the Company to third parties\nmaking an unsolicited proposal and participate in discussions or negotiations with such third parties\nregarding unsolicited proposals that are made prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board to change its recommendation that the Company\u2019s stockholders\napprove the adoption of the Merger Agreement prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger\nin specified circumstances relating to a Superior Company Proposal or Intervening Event, subject to\nPfizer\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment of the termination fee of $217\nmillion\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Company\nProposal, subject to certain conditions (including payment of the termination fee of $217 million and\ncertain rights of Pfizer to match the Superior Company Proposal)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, after discussion with GBT\u2019s advisors, that the $217 million Company Termination\nFee, which constitutes approximately 3.75% of GBT\u2019s equity value in the Merger, would not preclude a\nSuperior Company Proposal from being made\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Reverse Termination Fee of $326 million that may be owed by Pfizer to the Company in connection\nwith the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified antitrust related circumstances.\nFor a detailed discussion of the Merger Agreement, please see below under the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u201d.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Company\nstockholders who comply with all of the required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL\nin connection with the Merger, including the fact that such stockholders will have the right to demand\nappraisal and payment of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nFor a detailed discussion of appraisal rights, please see below under the section entitled \u201c-Appraisal\nRights\u201d.\n\u2022\nSpecific Performance. GBT\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek\nspecific performance of Pfizer\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent\nother breaches of the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nOpportunity for GBT Stockholders to Vote. The Board considered the fact that the Merger would be\nsubject to the approval of GBT stockholders, and GBT stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger\nand vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related\nto the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the following material factors:\n\u2022\nNo Participation in GBT\u2019s Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that if the Merger is\nconsummated, stockholders of the Company will receive the Merger Consideration in cash and will no\nlonger have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company or the\ncombined company or benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of GBT common stock,\nincluding any value that could be achieved if the Company engages in future strategic or other\ntransactions and/or is successful in commercializing any of its product candidates.\n\u2022\nClosing Conditions. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to\nthe parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is\nadopted by GBT stockholders.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nDisruption of the Company\u2019s Business. The Board considered the effect of a public announcement of the\nMerger on the Company\u2019s operations, stock price and employees and its ability to attract and retain\nmanagement, sales and other personnel while the Merger is pending and the potential adverse effects on\nthe financial and other results of the Company as a result of that disruption.\n\u2022\nNon-Solicitation Covenant. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the\nCompany\u2019s solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties and requires the Company to provide\nPfizer with an opportunity to propose adjustments to the Merger Agreement prior to the Company being\nable to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Company Proposal, although the Board\nbelieves this would not preclude another potential acquiror from submitting a proposal to acquire the\nCompany.\n\u2022\nCompany Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that the Company must pay Pfizer the Company\nTermination Fee of $217 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances,\nincluding to accept a Superior Company Proposal, and that the amount of the Company Termination Fee is\ncomparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, is reasonable, would not likely deter\ncompeting bids and would not likely be required to be paid unless the Company entered into a more\nfavorable transaction. The Board also recognized that the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to\nthese fees were insisted upon by Pfizer as a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nInterim Operating Covenants. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on\nthe conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, requiring the Company\nto conduct its and its subsidiaries\u2019 business in the ordinary course of business, which may delay or\nprevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the\nMerger (as more fully described under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business\nPending the Merger\u201d).\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the\nMerger might not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:\n\u2022\nGBT\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort\nand will have experienced significant distraction from their work during the pendency of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nGBT will have incurred significant transaction costs\u037e\n\u2022\nGBT\u2019s continuing business relationships with personnel, third-party payors, customers, suppliers and\nother business parties may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe trading price of shares of GBT common stock could be materially and adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perceptions of GBT\u2019s prospects could be adversely affected\u037e and\n\u2022\nGBT could lose management or other personnel of GBT during the pendency of the Merger.\n\u2022\nRegulatory Matters. The Board considered the regulatory approvals that would be required to\nconsummate the Merger and the prospects for receiving such approvals. The Board considered the fact\nthat (i) the parties would be required to use their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy the closing\nconditions relating to certain regulatory matters, including the expiration or termination of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, as well as the receipt of certain non-U.S. antitrust approvals, and (ii) Pfizer\nwould not be required to agree to, among other things, (A) sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold\nseparate any assets or businesses of the Company, Pfizer or any of their respective subsidiaries or (B)\naccept any operational restrictions on with respect to any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,\noperations or businesses of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. For a detailed discussion of regulatory\nmatters, please see below under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Efforts to\nConsummate the Merger\u201d.\n\u2022\nPotential Future Share Price. The possibility that, although the Merger provides the Company\u2019s\nstockholders the opportunity to realize a premium to the price at which GBT common stock traded prior to\nthe public announcement of the Merger, the price of GBT common stock might have increased in the future\nto a price greater than the Merger Consideration.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nTiming Risks. The Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including\nthat completion of the Merger depends on factors outside of GBT\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s control (including the\napproval of the Merger by GBT stockholders and certain governmental authorities), and the risk that the\npendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the execution of the\nMerger Agreement could divert GBT management\u2019s attention and have an adverse impact on GBT,\nincluding its client and other business relationships.\n\u2022\nLitigation Risk. The Board considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger\nAgreement and the consummation of the Merger.\n\u2022\nTax Treatment. The Board considered that the receipt of the Merger Consideration payable in the Merger\nwill generally be taxable to stockholders of the Company for United States federal income tax purposes. The\nBoard believed that this was mitigated by the fact that the entire consideration payable in the Merger\nwould be cash, providing adequate cash for the payment of any taxes due.\n\u2022\nOther Risks. The Board considered various other risks associated with the Merger and the business of the\nCompany, as more fully described below in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d.\nThe Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were\noutweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.\nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Board also considered that some of GBT\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of GBT stockholders\ngenerally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them at the time it approved the Merger Agreement\nand made its recommendation to GBT stockholders. For more information, please see the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Interests of GBT\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d. The foregoing discussion of\nthe information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material\npositive and negative factors considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in\nconnection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did\nnot, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and\nrecommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board\ndid not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular\naspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its unanimous\nrecommendation on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation\nof the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and\nshould be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nOpinion of J.P.

        "Opinion of J.P. Morgan": {
            "text": "Opinion of J.P. Morgan\nPursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as one of its financial advisors in connection\nwith the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Board on August 7, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such\ndate and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P.\nMorgan has confirmed its August 7, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Board, dated August 7,\n2022, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated August 7, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. GBT stockholders are urged to read\nthe opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in\nconnection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger\nConsideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other\n40TABLE OF CONTENTS\nclass of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the\nCompany to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a fairness\ncommittee of J.P. Morgan. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nGBT stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the GBT common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management\nof the Company relating to its business, which are referred to in this summary of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion as\nthe \u201cManagement Forecasts\u201d, and are described further in the section of this proxy statement below\nentitled \u201c-Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition\nand future prospects and operations of the Company and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or\nappropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness (and\ndid not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification). J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was\nnot provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nthe Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying\non financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they\nwere reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by\nmanagement as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such\nanalyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on\nwhich they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the\nrepresentations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related\nagreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,\nregulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues.\nJ.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for\nthe consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated\nbenefits of the Merger.\nThe Management Projections were prepared by the Company\u2019s management. The Company does not publicly\ndisclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nanalysis of the proposed Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndisclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and\nmay be beyond the control of the Company\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general\neconomic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary\nsignificantly from those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other\nforward-looking statements, please refer to the section of this proxy statement below entitled \u201c-Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed\nno opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company or the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P.\nMorgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or\nemployees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the Merger Consideration in\nthe proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that\nof the Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the\nBoard in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board\nor management with respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on August 7, 2022 and contained in the presentation delivered to\nthe Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The summary below does not purport to be\na complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial\nanalyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to\nmore fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text\nof each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the\nCompany with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged\nto be analogous to the Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:\nSelected Companies\nApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nCrispr Therapeutics AG\nIntellia Therapeutics, Inc.\nAmicus Therapeutics, Inc.\nINSMED Inc.\nBiocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\nEditas Medicine, Inc.\nReata Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nMedian FV/2026E Revenue Multiple = 3.5x\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations\nand business that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, J.P. Morgan considered to be similar to those of the\nCompany. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfrom those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe selected companies differently than they would affect the Company.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated the multiple of the firm value (\u201cFV\u201d) for the Company and\nthe selected companies (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable net debt or net cash) to the analyst\nconsensus estimates for calendar year 2026 revenues for the applicable company (the \u201cFV/2026E Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2026E Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of\n1.1x to 5.2x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the calendar year\n2026 provided in the Management Forecasts. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the\nGBT common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $21.25 to $88.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to\nthe implied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.\nSelected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions with\nrespect to businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be similar to the Company\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based\non J.P. Morgan\u2019s experience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates. The following\ntransactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:\nAnnouncement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nJanuary 19, 2022\nZogenix, Inc.\nUCB S.A.\nSeptember 8. 2021\nKadmon Holdings, Inc.\nSanofi\nFebruary 1, 2021\nViela Bio, Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nAugust 31, 2020\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc.\nNestl\u00e9 S.A.\nMay 5, 2020\nPortola Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSeptember 30, 2019\nDova Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nSwedish Orphan Biovitrum AB\nSeptember 12, 2016\nRaptor Pharmaceutical Corp.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nJuly 21, 2016\nRelypsa Inc.\nGalenica Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nMarch 30, 2015\nHyperion Therapeutics Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nMedian FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple = 3.5x\nNone of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the selected transactions\nwere chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered\nsimilar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company\u2019s estimated forward revenue for the fourth\nyear following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the \u201cFV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple reference range for the\nCompany of 2.6x to 5.4x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the\ntwelve-month period ending September 30, 2026, $1.2 billion, which amount was provided by the management of the\nCompany. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT common stock (rounded to\nthe nearest $0.25) of approximately $44.25 to $83.75, which J.P. Morgan compared to the implied per share equity value\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of\ndetermining the fully diluted equity value per share for the GBT common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered\nfree cash flows that the Company is expected to generate from October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2042, including\nthe impact of certain net operating losses based upon the Management Forecasts. J.P. Morgan also calculated a\nrange of terminal values of the Company at the end of this period by applying perpetual growth rates ranging from\n(50.0%) to (30.0%) for Oxbryta, GBT601 and inclacumab, 5.0% for research assets and 2.0%\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfor corporate overhead and other unallocated expenses based on guidance provided by the Company\u2019s management,\nto estimates of the unlevered free cash flow of the Company during calendar year 2042 as set forth in the\nManagement Forecasts. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to\npresent values as of September 30, 2022 using a range of discount rates from 10.5% to 13.5%, which were chosen by\nJ.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the\nunlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by adding net cash as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, $351 million, which estimate was provided by the management of the Company. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values for the Company, which J.P. Morgan divided by the number of outstanding\nshares of GBT common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis and adjusted for the Company\u2019s assumed future\nequity raise of $200 million in gross proceeds in 2023, to derive a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT\ncommon stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $52.25 and $65.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to the\nimplied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.\nCertain Other Information. J.P. Morgan also reviewed the Company\u2019s 52 week historical trading and analyst price\ntargets, in each case as of August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of GBT\ncommon stock was perceived by J.P. Morgan to be affected by a potential transaction) which ranged from $22.30 to\n$40.26 and $31.00 to $102.00, respectively. J.P. Morgan noted that historical stock trading and analyst price targets\nanalyses are not valuation methodologies but were presented merely for informational purposes.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the\nforegoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of\nthe processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the\nCompany. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses\nor factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or\nnegative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected\ntransactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are\npublicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their\nparticipants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger.\nThe analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to\nthe Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company with respect to the\nMerger and deliver an opinion to the Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such\nexperience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company\nand the industries in which it operates.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger (including the delivery of its opinion), the\nCompany will pay J.P. Morgan an aggregate fee of, approximately, $53,200,000, of which $2,000,000 became payable\nupon public announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement with respect to a Merger and the remainder of\nwhich is payable upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P.\nMorgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,\nand will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the two\nyears preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material\nfinancial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company. During the\ntwo years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or\ninvestment banking relationships with Parent, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary\ncompensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on\nParent\u2019s credit facility in November 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on Parent\u2019s offering of debt securities in August\n2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit\nfacilities of Parent, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. During the two-year\nperiod preceding delivery of its opinion on August 7, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Parent\nwere approximately $14 million. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of\nthe outstanding common stock of each of the Company and Parent. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P.\nMorgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or Parent for their own accounts or for the accounts of\ncustomers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial\ninstruments.\nOpinion of Centerview",

In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available\nfinancial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for the Company and compared that data with similar\ndata for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview\ndeemed relevant. Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the\nfinancial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview deemed relevant, and\nconducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as Centerview\ndeemed appropriate.\nCenterview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness\nof the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by\nCenterview for purposes of its opinion and, with the Company\u2019s consent, Centerview relied upon such information as\nbeing complete and accurate.

The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of, Centerview,\nnor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nfinancial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than\nother assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized\nbelow should not be taken to be Centerview\u2019s view of the actual value of the Company. Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the\nfinancial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not\nconstitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the\ntables below without considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses\nor factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors, could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview\u2019s financial analyses and its opinion. In\nperforming its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general\nbusiness and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company or any\nother parties to the Transaction. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in\nthese analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the Company\ndo not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the Company\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmay actually be sold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial\nanalyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative\ninformation, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 5,\n2022 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Transaction) and is not necessarily indicative of\ncurrent market conditions.\nSelected Public Company Analysis.\nCenterview reviewed certain financial information of the Company and compared it to corresponding financial\ninformation of certain publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies that Centerview selected based on its experience\nand professional judgment (which companies are referred to as the \u201cselected companies\u201d in this summary of\nCenterview\u2019s opinion). Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, the\ncompanies listed below were chosen by Centerview because, among other reasons, they are publicly traded\nbiopharmaceutical companies with certain business, operational and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of\nCenterview\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company.\nHowever, because each of the selected companies has business, operational and/or financial characteristics that\ndiffer significantly from those of the Company, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did\nnot, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also\nmade qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the\nbusiness, operational and/or financial characteristics of the Company and the selected companies that could affect\nthe public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative\nanalysis.\nUsing publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of August 5, 2022,\nCenterview calculated, for each selected company, such company\u2019s enterprise value (calculated as the equity value\n(determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, warrants,\nrestricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities) plus the book value of debt less cash\nand cash equivalents as a multiple of Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated revenue for calendar year\n2026 (\u201cEV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiple\u201d).\nThe selected companies are summarized below:\nSelected Company\nAmicus Therapeutics, Inc.\nApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nBioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nInsmed Incorporated\nMedian EV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiple = 3.6x\nBased on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and\nexperience, Centerview selected a reference range of EV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiples of 2.00x to 4.25x to apply\nto the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2026 net revenue as set forth in the Management Forecasts\nand to Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated net revenue for the Company for calendar year 2026. In\nselecting these ranges of EV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiples, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its\nexperience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, operational and/or financial\ncharacteristics of the Company and the selected companies that could affect their public trading values in order to\nprovide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Applying this range of EV/2026E\nRevenue Trading Multiples to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2026 net revenue as set forth in\nthe Management Forecasts of $1.293 billion under the Management Forecasts, and to Wall Street research analyst\nconsensus estimated net revenue for the Company for calendar year 2026 of $912 million, and adding to such\namounts the Company\u2019s estimated net cash as of September 30, 2022 provided by the Company management as set\nforth in the Internal Data, and dividing the results of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted\noutstanding shares of GBT common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account\noutstanding in-the-money options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and shares issuable upon\nconversion of the Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 1:\nAdoption of the Merger Agreement-Capped Call Transactions\u201d), if\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\napplicable), based on information provided by the Company management as of August 4, 2022 as set forth in the\nInternal Data. For the purposes of Centerview\u2019s analysis, net cash and fully diluted outstanding shares of GBT\ncommon stock varied depending on whether the Convertible Notes were deemed to be in-the-money (at implied\nequity values per share above $31.75) or out-of-the-money (at implied equity values per share at or below $31.75).\nThis analysis resulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of GBT common stock of approximately\n$35.85 to $71.65 and $25.45 to $52.90, respectively, rounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared these\nranges to the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share to be paid to the holders of shares of GBT common stock\n(other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nSelected Precedent Transaction Analysis.\nCenterview reviewed and analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions involving\nbiopharmaceutical companies (which transactions are referred to as the \u201cselected transactions\u201d in this summary of\nCenterview\u2019s opinion) that Centerview, based on its experience and professional judgment, deemed relevant to\nconsider in relation to the Company and the Transaction. Although none of the selected transactions is directly\ncomparable to the Transaction, these transactions were selected, among other reasons, because they have certain\nbusiness, operational and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of Centerview\u2019s analysis, may be considered\nsimilar to the Transaction. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent\ntransactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operational and/or financial\nconditions and prospects of the Company and the companies included in the selected precedent transactions\nanalysis. This analysis involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments concerning differences in\nbusiness, operational and/or financial characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading,\nacquisition or other values of the target companies in the selected transactions and the Company.\nUsing publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of the time of the\nannouncement of the selected transactions, Centerview calculated, for each selected transaction, the transaction\nvalue (calculated as the offer value (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding\nin-the-money options, warrants, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities), plus\nthe book value of debt and certain liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and excluding any contingent\nconsideration) implied for each target company based on the consideration payable in the applicable selected\ntransaction) as a multiple of the target company\u2019s Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated four-year forward\nnet revenue at the time of the transaction announcement (\u201cFour-Year Forward Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nThe selected transactions considered in this analysis are summarized below:\nDate Announced\nTarget\nAcquiror\nAugust 4, 2022\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\nAmgen Inc.\nJanuary 19, 2022\nZogenix, Inc.\nUCB S.A.\nSeptember 8, 2021\nKadmon Holdings, Inc.\nSanofi\nFebruary 1, 2021\nViela Bio, Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nAugust 31, 2020\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc.\nNestle Health Science US Holdings, Inc.\nMay 5, 2020\nPortola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSeptember 30, 2019\nDova Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSwedish Orphan Biovitrum AB\nSeptember 12, 2016\nRaptor Pharmaceutical Corp.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nJuly 21, 2016\nRelypsa, Inc.\nGalenica AG\nMarch 30, 2015\nHyperion Therapeutics, Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nMedian Transaction Value/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple = 3.6x\nBased on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its experience and professional\njudgment, related to, among other things, differences in the business, operational and/or financial conditions and\nprospects of the Company and the companies included in the selected precedent transactions analysis, Centerview\nselected a reference range of Four-Year Forward Revenue Multiples of 3.00x to 4.50x derived from the selected\nprecedent transactions. Centerview applied this reference range of Four-Year Forward Revenue Multiples to Wall\nStreet research analyst consensus estimated four-year forward net revenue of $874 million, and added to it the\nCompany\u2019s estimated net cash as of September 30, 2022, adjusted for an estimated $77 million in change of control\npayments and prepayment penalties under the Company\u2019s outstanding\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nterm loan payable in connection with the Transaction, provided by the Company management as set forth in the\nInternal Data, and divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the Company\u2019s fully diluted outstanding shares\nof GBT common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-\nmoney options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and shares issuable upon conversion of the\nConvertible Notes, including additional shares of GBT common stock issued as a result of the make-whole with\nrespect to the Convertible Notes, if applicable) based on information provided by the Company management as of\nAugust 4, 2022 as set forth in the Internal Data. For the purposes of Centerview\u2019s analysis, net cash and fully diluted\nshares varied depending on whether the Convertible Notes were deemed to be in-the-money (at implied equity values\nper share above $31.75) or out-of-the-money (at implied equity values per share at or below $31.75). This analysis\nresulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of GBT common stock of approximately $34.55 to $50.35,\nrounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared this range to the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share\nto be paid to the holders of shares of GBT common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis.\nCenterview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on the Internal Data. A discounted\ncash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or set of assets by\ncalculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of estimated future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to\nthe current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts\nby a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of\ncapital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.\nIn performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of equity values for shares of GBT common stock by (a)\ndiscounting to present value as of September 30, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.5% (reflecting\nCenterview\u2019s analysis of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital) and using a mid-year convention: (i) the\nforecasted risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of the Company over the period beginning on October 1,\n2022 and ending on December 31, 2042, utilized by Centerview based on the Management Forecasts, (ii) an implied\nterminal value of the Company, calculated by Centerview by assuming that unlevered free cash flows would decline\nin perpetuity after December 31, 2042 (with the exception of cash flows associated with research assets and corporate\noverhead and other unallocated expenses), based on guidance provided by the Company management, and (iii) tax\nsavings from usage of the Company\u2019s federal net operating losses of $1.081 billion as of September 30, 2022 and the\nCompany\u2019s future losses and (b) adding to the foregoing results the Company\u2019s estimated net cash as of September\n30, 2022, $351 million (adjusted for the conversion of the Convertible Notes, if applicable), which amount was\nprovided by the Company management as set forth in the Internal Data, and an assumed equity raise of $200 million\nin 2023 as set forth in the Internal Data. Centerview divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the Company\u2019s\nfully diluted outstanding shares of GBT common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into\naccount outstanding in-the-money options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and shares issuable upon\nconversion of the Convertible Notes, if applicable), based on information provided by the Company management as\nof August 4, 2022 as set forth in the Internal Data. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share\nof GBT common stock of $56.35 to $65.25, rounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared this range to the\nMerger Consideration of $68.50 per share to be paid to the holders of shares of GBT common stock (other than\nExcluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nOther Factors\nCenterview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other\nthings, the following:\n\u2022\nHistorical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of shares of\nGBT common stock during the 52-week period ended August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date\non which the trading price of GBT common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential\ntransaction), which reflected low and high stock closing prices for the Company during such period of\n$22.30 to $40.26 per share of GBT common stock, and the closing trading price of shares of GBT common\nstock on August 5, 2022 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Transaction) of $63.84\nper share of GBT common stock.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nAnalyst Price Targets Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for shares of GBT common stock\nin publicly available Wall Street research analyst reports as of August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to\nthe date on which the trading price of GBT common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a\npotential transaction) which indicated low and high stock price targets for the Company ranging from\n$31.00 to $102.00, and a median of $65.00, per share of GBT common stock.\n\u2022\nPrecedent Premiums Paid Analysis. Centerview performed an analysis of premiums paid in the selected\ntransactions involving publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies, as set forth above in \u201cSelected\nPrecedent Transaction Analysis\u201d. The premiums in this analysis were calculated by comparing the per\nshare acquisition price in each transaction to the closing price of the target company\u2019s common stock for\nthe date one day prior to the date on which the trading price of the target\u2019s common stock was perceived\nby Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction. Based on the analysis above and other\nconsiderations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment, Centerview applied a range of\n50% to 100% to the Company\u2019s closing stock price on August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date\non which the trading price of GBT common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential\ntransaction) of $33.93, which resulted in an implied price range of approximately $50.90 to $67.85 per share\nof GBT common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most\nappropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular\ncircumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its\nopinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it\nconsidered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional\njudgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.\nCenterview\u2019s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in\nits evaluation of the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative\nof the views of the Board or management of the Company with respect to the Merger Consideration or as to whether\nthe Board would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the\nTransaction was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was approved\nby the Board. Centerview provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Centerview did not, however\nrecommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific amount of\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transaction.\nCenterview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment\nbanking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion,\nexcept for Centerview\u2019s current engagement, Centerview has not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other\nservices to the Company, and Centerview has not received any compensation from the Company during such period.\nIn the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview was engaged to provide financial advisory\nservices unrelated to the Merger to Parent, including in connection with Parent\u2019s acquisition of Arena\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2022 and certain other strategic matters. Centerview received between $20 million and $30\nmillion in aggregate compensation from Parent for work performed during such period. Centerview may provide\nfinancial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company or Parent or their respective affiliates in the\nfuture, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 directors,\nofficers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview\u2019s affiliates or related\ninvestment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial\ninterests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other\nsecurities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the\nCompany, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.\nThe Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on Centerview\u2019s\nknowledge of the biopharmaceutical industry. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm\nthat has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Transaction.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn connection with Centerview\u2019s services as a financial advisor to the Board, the Company has agreed to pay\nCenterview an aggregate fee of approximately $42 million, $2 million of which was payable upon the rendering of\nCenterview\u2019s opinion and $40 million of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. In\naddition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview\u2019s expenses arising, and to indemnify\nCenterview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview\u2019s engagement.\nCapped Call Transactions",

On December 15,\n2021, in connection with the initial purchasers\u2019 exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, GBT\nentered into additional capped call transactions with each of the Capped Call Counterparties (which we refer to as the\n\u201cAdditional Capped Call Transactions\u201d and, together with the Base Capped Call Transactions, the \u201cCapped Call\nTransactions\u201d).\nThe Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares\nof GBT common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is\n$31.7475 per share of GBT common stock, and the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is $49.80 per share of\nGBT common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The\nCapped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to GBT common stock upon conversion\nof the Convertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that GBT could be required to make in excess of\nthe principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject\nto a cap based on the cap price.\nIf the Merger is consummated, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes, and the\nconsummation of the Merger is expected to result in the full termination of the Capped Call Transactions. The value\nreceived by the Company in connection with the termination or unwinding of the Capped Call Transactions would be\ndetermined by the Capped Call Counterparties based on the fair value of the Capped Call Transactions, which is\ncontingent on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, volatility, spot price and liquidity of GBT common\nstock.\nIn addition, following the announcement of the Merger, the Capped Call Counterparties may adjust the terms of the\napplicable Capped Call Transactions on more than one occasion to reflect the economic effect of such\nannouncement, including if such economic effect is material, and regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\nEach Capped Call Counterparty shall, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, in its capacity as\ncalculation agent with respect to its Capped Call Transaction, determine whether such announcement has had a\nmaterial economic effect on such Capped Call Transaction and may take into account a number of factors, including\nthe date of the announcement (and the remaining term of its Capped Call Transaction at that time), the stock price of\nGBT common stock and changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected dividends of GBT common stock,\nin determining whether an adjustment to the cap price of its Capped Call Transaction is appropriate. Each Capped Call\nCounterparty may make additional adjustments to the cap price of its Capped Call Transaction following the\nannouncement of a change to the Merger, including a withdrawal from, or the abandonment or discontinuation of, the\nMerger.\nThe indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of the Capped\nCall Transactions were included as exhibits, in each case, to GBT\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by GBT with the\nSEC on December 17, 2021.

In June 2022, in connection with the evaluation of a proposed transaction, at the\n52TABLE OF CONTENTS\ndirection of the Board, senior management of the Company with the assistance of the Company\u2019s financial advisors\nprepared certain preliminary non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through\n2042. In July and August 2022, in the context of evaluating the proposals from Pfizer and other potential acquirors,\nGBT senior management with the assistance of the Company\u2019s financial advisors updated such preliminary non-\npublic, unaudited prospective financial information to take into account certain downward adjustments relating to,\namong other things, developments and business momentum, trends and forecasts, including developments relating\nto coverage, reimbursement and payor rules and policies applicable to, and pricing of, Oxbryta (which we refer to as\nthe \u201cManagement Forecasts\u201d).\nGBT is including a summary of the Management Forecasts to provide GBT stockholders with access to information\nthat was made available to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Consideration.\nThe Management Forecasts were not provided to Pfizer or any of the other potential acquirors.\nThe Board reviewed the Management Forecasts and, following discussions with GBT management, the Board\nauthorized GBT\u2019s financial advisors to use the Management Forecasts, or a subset thereof, for purposes of their\nrespective financial analyses and fairness opinions summarized in the sections of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\nOpinion of J.P.

The Management Forecasts were also provided to and\nused by J.P. Morgan and Centerview, GBT\u2019s financial advisors, for the purpose of performing financial analyses in\nconnection with the strategic review process and for the purpose of evaluating the fairness of the Merger\nConsideration from a financial point of view.\nThe summary of the Management Forecasts is included in this proxy statement solely to give GBT stockholders\naccess to certain financial forecasts that were made available to the Board, J.P. Morgan and Centerview and is not\nbeing included in this proxy statement to influence a GBT stockholder\u2019s decision whether to vote for the Merger\nAgreement Proposal or for any other purpose.\nThe Management Forecasts were generated solely for internal use and not developed with a view toward public\ndisclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the SEC\nregarding forward-looking statements or GAAP, but, in the view of GBT management, were reasonably prepared in\ngood faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented\nas of the time of preparation. No independent registered public accounting firm provided any assistance in preparing\nthe Management Forecasts. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled\nor otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the Management Forecasts or expressed any opinion or given\nany other form of assurance with respect thereto, and they assume no responsibility for the information contained in\nthe Management Forecasts. The KPMG LLP report included in GBT\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021 relates solely to the historical financial information of GBT and to an assessment of GBT\u2019s\ninternal controls over financial reporting. Such reports do not extend to the Management Forecasts and should not\nbe read to do so.\nThe inclusion of the Management Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that GBT, Pfizer, their affiliates\nor financial advisors or any of their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information considered,\nor now considers, the Management Forecasts to be necessarily predictive of future results. There can be no\nassurance that the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than\nestimated, whether or not the Merger is completed. None of GBT, Parent or their respective affiliates, officers,\ndirectors, advisors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the\nManagement Forecasts, and, except as required by applicable law, none of GBT, Parent or their respective affiliates\nundertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Management Forecasts to reflect\ncircumstances existing after the date the Management Forecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future\nevents even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Management Forecasts are shown to be\ninappropriate. None of GBT or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes\nany representation to any GBT stockholder or other person regarding the information included in the Management\nForecasts or GBT\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Management Forecasts or that\nforecasted results will be achieved. GBT has made no representation to Parent, in the Merger Agreement or\notherwise, concerning the Management Forecasts. The Management Forecasts are forward-looking statements. The\nassumptions and estimates underlying the Management Forecasts, all of which are difficult to predict and many of\nwhich are beyond the control of GBT, may not be realized. Neither GBT nor any of its affiliates assumes any\nresponsibility to holders of shares of GBT common stock for the accuracy of this information. In particular, the\nManagement Forecasts, while presented with numerical specificity necessarily, were based on numerous variables\nand assumptions that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,\ncompetitive and regulatory risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontained in the Management Forecasts. Because the Management Forecasts cover multiple years, by their nature,\nthey become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each\ncircumstance that will have an effect on the commercial value of Oxbryta and the Company\u2019s product candidates. As\na result, there can be no assurance that the Management Forecasts accurately reflect future trends or accurately\nestimate the future market for Oxbryta and the Company\u2019s product candidates. There can be no assurance of the\napproval, or timing of such approval, of any of the Company\u2019s clinical-stage product candidates, and it is possible\nthat other therapeutic scenarios will be preferable. Important factors that may affect actual results and results in the\nManagement Forecasts not being achieved include, but are not limited to: risks and uncertainties relating to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including the extent and duration of the impact on the Company\u2019s business, the results of\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Company\u2019s commercialization of Oxbryta, obtaining marketing approvals for Oxbryta in additional indications or\nin additional jurisdictions, the potential safety, efficacy or other therapeutic benefits of Oxbryta and the Company\u2019s\nproduct candidates, maintaining the scope and extent of GBT\u2019s intellectual property and regulatory protections, the\ntiming of regulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing, labeling, market uptake of the Company\u2019s\nproduct candidates, the effects of healthcare reform, the effect of regulatory actions, availability of third-party\nreimbursement, impact of competitive products and pricing, the effect of regulatory actions, the effect of global\neconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the cost and effect of changes in tax and other\nlegislation and other risk factors described in GBT\u2019s SEC filings, including GBT\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on\nForm 8-K, and described under the section below entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements\u201d. The Management Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to\nchange.\nModeling and forecasting the future commercialization of products and clinical, pre-clinical and research stage\nproduct candidates is a highly speculative endeavor. In addition to the various limitations, risks and uncertainties\ndescribed above, we also cannot assure you that the Company will obtain and maintain any of the regulatory\napprovals necessary for the commercialization of Oxbryta or its product candidates, or that the Company\u2019s\ncompetitors will not commercialize products that are safer, more effective or more successfully marketed and sold than\nOxbryta or any products that the Company may commercialize in the future. Some or all of the estimates and\nassumptions underlying the Management Forecasts may have changed since the date the Management Forecasts\nwere prepared. The information set forth in the Management Forecasts is not fact and should not be relied upon as\nbeing necessarily indicative of future results. The Management Forecasts were developed on a standalone basis\nwithout giving effect to the Merger, and therefore the Management Forecasts do not give effect to the Merger or any\nchanges to GBT\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including\ncost synergies realized as a result of the Merger, or to any costs incurred in connection with the Merger. Furthermore,\nthe Management Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be completed and\nshould not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Management Forecasts contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that GBT management believes are helpful\nin understanding GBT\u2019s past financial performance and future results. GBT management regularly uses a variety of\nfinancial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial\nperformance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\ncomparable GAAP measures. While GBT believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful\ninformation to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze GBT\u2019s financial and business trends on\na period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These\nnon-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of GBT\u2019s\ncompetitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of GBT\u2019s competitors due to potential\ndifferences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-\nGAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a\nboard of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business combination such as the Merger if\nthe disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures were not relied upon by the Board or GBT\u2019s financial advisors in connection with their respective\nevaluations of the Merger. Accordingly, GBT has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures\nincluded in the Management Forecasts to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nThe Management Forecasts summarized in this section were prepared prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement\nand have not been updated to reflect any changes after the date they were prepared. THE COMPANY DOES NOT\nINTEND, AND UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION, TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE PROJECTIONS\nTO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING SINCE THEIR PREPARATION OR TO REFLECT THE\nOCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS\nUNDERLYING THE PROJECTIONS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE. In light of the foregoing factors and the\nuncertainties inherent in the Management Forecasts, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place\nundue reliance on the Management Forecasts.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInterests of GBT\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",

The amounts reflected in the table below exclude any grants that may be made following August 15, 2022 and\nany Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in accordance\nwith their terms prior to December 31, 2022 (the assumed date of the completion of the Merger solely for purposes of\nthis transaction-related compensation disclosure). Company Options are valued based on the difference between the\nper share exercise price of such Company Option and the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share. As a result, any\nCompany Option included in the table below that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Merger\nConsideration does not have any value for purposes of the table below. Company RSUs and Company PSUs (other\nthan Stock Price PSUs) are valued based on the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share. Stock Price PSUs will be\nforfeited upon the consummation of the Merger and, therefore, are excluded from the amounts listed in the below\ntable. Payments in respect of all Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by the Company\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers that were outstanding on the date of the Merger Agreement are \u201csingle-trigger\u201d in\nthat they will be paid upon the consummation of the Merger.\nName\nOptions\nRSUs\nPSUs1\nTotal ($)\n#\n($)\n#\n($)\n#\n($)\n#\n($)\nExecutive Officers\nTed Love\n215,189\n5,773,239\n149,105\n10,213,684\n109,316\n7,488,112\n473,610\n23,475,035\nJeffrey Farrow\n59,582\n1,504,350\n41,458\n2,839,890\n26,502\n1,815,387\n127,542\n6,159,627\nJung Choi\n59,582\n1,504,350\n41,458\n2,839,890\n26,502\n1,815,387\n127,542\n6,159,627\nDavid Johnson\n59,582\n1,504,350\n43,351\n2,969,526\n26,502\n1,815,387\n129,435\n6,289,263\nKim Smith-Whitley\n45,448\n1,593,012\n30,577\n2,094,525\n26,502\n1,815,387\n102,527\n5,502,924\nNazila Habibizad\n40,817\n1,282,211\n29,795\n2,040,923\n26,502\n1,815,387\n97,114\n5,138,521\nTricia Suvari\n59,582\n1,504,350\n41,458\n2,839,890\n26,502\n1,815,387\n127,542\n6,159,627\nCarrie Krehlik\n57,360\n2,216,508\n39,640\n2,715,340\n26,502\n1,815,387\n123,502\n6,747,235\nDirectors\nDawn Svoronos\n2,800\n129,360\n3,600\n246,600\n-\n-\n6,400\n375,960\nMark Perry\n2,800\n129,360\n3,600\n246,600\n-\n-\n6,400\n375,960\nGlenn Pierce\n2,800\n129,360\n3,600\n246,600\n-\n-\n6,400\n375,960\nAlexis Thompson\n7,935\n263,972\n8,400\n575,400\n-\n-\n16,335\n839,372\nDeval Patrick\n2,800\n129,360\n3,600\n246,600\n-\n-\n6,400\n375,960\nPhilip Pizzo\n2,800\n129,360\n3,600\n246,600\n-\n-\n6,400\n375,960\nWendy Yarno\n2,800\n129,360\n3,600\n246,600\n-\n-\n6,400\n375,960\nScott Morrison\n2,800\n129,360\n3,600\n246,600\n-\n-\n6,400\n375,960\nWillie Brown (director\nemeritus)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUnder the Merger Agreement, upon the Effective Time, Company PSUs (other than Stock Price PSUs) will be canceled and\nconverted into the right to receive cash (assuming all applicable performance measures are satisfied at the greater of (x) the\ntarget level of performance and (y) the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time)). The number of\nCompany PSUs shown assumes that Company PSUs subject to total shareholder return performance metrics have been earned at\nthe maximum level and Company PSUs subject to patient share performance metrics have been earned at the target level. Such\nassumptions were made based on the Company\u2019s latest performance estimates for the applicable performance measures, as of\nAugust 15, 2022.\nSeverance Entitlements\nEach of the executive officers participates in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Severance and Change in\nControl Policy, which we refer to as the \u201cSeverance Plan\u201d. The Severance Plan provides for severance payments and\nother benefits in the event of a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d, which means a termination of employment by the Company\nwithout cause or by the executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as described below) on or within the 12-month period\nfollowing a change in control of GBT. The Merger will constitute a change in control of GBT for purposes of the\nSeverance Plan. For purposes of the Severance Plan, \u201cgood reason\u201d generally means (a) a material diminution in the\nexecutive\u2019s job responsibilities (provided that a change in the executive\u2019s\n57\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\njob title or reporting relationship will not be deemed a material diminution in the executive\u2019s job responsibilities)\u037e (b) a\nmaterial diminution in the executive\u2019s then-current base salary\u037e or (c) the Company requiring the executive to be\nbased at an office location which is at least 25 miles from the executive\u2019s then-current office location.\nIn the event of a qualifying termination, each executive officer would be entitled to receive: (a) a lump-sum cash\npayment equal to the product of (1) the executive\u2019s applicable multiple (which is 1.5 in the case of Dr. Love and 1.0 in\nthe case of all other executive officers) and (2) the sum of (x) the executive\u2019s annual base salary and (y) the\nexecutive\u2019s target annual cash bonus\u037e (b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the portion of the year in which the Effective\nTime occurs (with the proration based on the executive\u2019s date of termination)\u037e (c) subsidized health and welfare\nbenefits premiums for 12 months (or 18 months, in the case of Dr. Love)\u037e and (d) outplacement services. Receipt of\nthe above-described payments and benefits is conditioned upon the applicable executive officer executing a release\nof claims in favor of the Company. The estimated aggregate value of the severance payments and benefits that the\nCompany\u2019s executive officers would receive in the event of a qualifying termination on or following the completion of\nthe Merger is $7,016,851. The foregoing estimate is based on compensation and benefit levels in effect as of August\n15, 2022. The executive officers\u2019 outstanding unvested equity awards would be treated as described above in the\nsection entitled \u201cInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity and\nEquity-Based Awards\u201d.\nThe Severance Plan provides that in the event that any payment or benefit (regardless of whether payable under the\nSeverance Plan or otherwise and including the acceleration of equity awards) payable to an executive officer in\nconnection with his or her separation from the Company would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of\nSection 280G of the Code, then such payment or benefit is only reduced below the limit under Section 280G of the\nCode if the executive officer would end up in a better financial position than receiving the full amount and paying the\n20% excise tax. The Severance Plan does not provide for a gross-up in the event the executive officer is subject to the\n\u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.\nContinuing Employee Benefits\nThe Merger Agreement provides that for a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time, Pfizer will,\nand will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who was an employee of the Company or any of\nits subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, which we refer to as a \u201ccontinuing employee\u201d, subject to such\nindividual\u2019s continued employment, with (a) a base salary or base wage and target cash incentive opportunities that\nare, in each case, no less favorable than such continuing employee\u2019s base salary or base wage and target cash\nincentive opportunities as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) long-term incentive opportunities that\nare no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Pfizer, (c) severance benefits that are no\nless favorable than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (d) other\nemployee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such continuing employee\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time.\nParent has agreed to, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) recognize a continuing employee\u2019s service with the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries prior to the completion of the Merger for all purposes, including determining such\ncontinuing employee\u2019s eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, under benefit plans in which continuing\nemployees will participate after the completion of the Merger (subject to certain exceptions), (ii) cause all preexisting\ncondition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods applicable to continuing\nemployees under the Company\u2019s or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s welfare plans to be waived, to the extent such\nlimitations were waived or satisfied prior to the Effective Time and (iii) provide continuing employees with credit\nunder any such welfare plan for any co-payments or deductibles incurred prior to the Effective Time.\nWith respect to annual bonuses payable under the Company\u2019s annual bonus plan with respect to fiscal year 2022, if\nClosing occurs prior to the payment of such bonuses, Pfizer has agreed to pay such bonuses in accordance with the\nterms of the annual bonus plan and fund the payment pool at no less than the level at which such pool would have\nbeen funded assuming achievement of the target level of performance.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Board and executive officers of the Company will be\nentitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninsurance policies following the Merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the Merger Agreement\nrelating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Indemnification and Insurance\u201d.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company\u2019s named\nexecutive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger and\nthat will or may become payable to the named executive officer either immediately at the Effective Time (i.e., on a\n\u201csingle-trigger\u201d basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment on or following the completion of the\nMerger (i.e., on a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d basis). The holders of shares of GBT common stock are being asked to approve,\non a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation for these named executive officers. Because the vote to\napprove such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company, the Board or Pfizer.\nAccordingly, if the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of shares of GBT common\nstock and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to\napprove such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes\nto the tables below and above under \u201c-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The\nestimated values are based on (a) an assumption that the Merger is completed on December 31, 2022, (b) a per share\nMerger Consideration of $68.50, (c) the named executive officers\u2019 salary and total eligible bonus levels as in effect as\nof the date of this proxy statement, (d) the number of unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company\nPSUs held by the named executive officers as of August 15, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such\namounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and excluding any additional grants that may occur following such\ndate and any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in\naccordance with their terms prior to December 31, 2022, and (e) an assumption that each named executive officer\u2019s\nemployment is terminated by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or by the named executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d\n(each, as defined in the Severance Plan) immediately following the completion of the Merger. In addition, the amounts\nindicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including\nassumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur\nbefore the completion of the Merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive\nofficer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nThe amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a Section\n280G best-net cutback\u037e therefore, actual payments to the named executive officers may be less than the amounts\nindicated below.\nPotential Payments to Named Executive Officers\nName\nCash \nSeverance\n($)(1)\nEquity \n($)(2)\nBenefits\n($)(3)\nTotal ($)\nTed Love\n2,427,750\n23,475,035\n63,000\n25,965,785\nJeffrey Farrow\n988,000\n6,159,627\n45,000\n7,192,627\nJung Choi\n958,000\n6,159,627\n15,000\n7,132,627\nDavid Johnson\n988,000\n6,291,318\n45,000\n7,324,318\nKim Smith-Whitley\n1,020,000\n5,504,979\n45,000\n6,569,979\n(1)\nThe estimated amounts shown in this column represent (a) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the executive\u2019s\napplicable multiple (which is 1.5 in the case of Dr. Love and 1.0 in the case of all other named executive officers) and (2) the\nsum of (x) the named executive officer\u2019s annual base salary and (y) the named executive officer\u2019s target annual cash bonus and\n(b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2022. The value of the\npro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2022, for Drs. Love and Smith-\nWhitley, Messrs. Farrow and Johnson and Ms. Choi is $522,900, $255,000, $247,000, $247,000 and $239,500, respectively.\nThese payments are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d, as they will only be payable in the event of a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d on or following the\nEffective Time.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(2)\nThe estimated amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate intrinsic value of the named executive officers\u2019 outstanding\nunvested Company Options (the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration of $68.50 over the applicable exercise\nprice) and the aggregate value of outstanding unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs (other than Stock Price PSUs, which\nwill be forfeited).

Love and Smith-Whitley and Messrs. Farrow and Johnson, the estimated amounts shown in this column\nrepresent the value of cash payments for a period of 12 months (or 18 months in the case of Dr. Love) following a qualifying\ntermination equal to the cost of continued health and dental coverage under COBRA and outplacement benefits. Since Ms. Choi\ndoes not participate in the Company\u2019s health insurance plan, she will not receive continued health and dental coverage under\nCOBRA and, therefore, the estimated amounts shown in this column only reflect the value of her outplacement benefits. The\nestimated value of outplacement benefits for each named executive officer is $15,000. These are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d benefits in that\nthey will be paid to the named executive officer only if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of\nemployment under the Severance Plan on or following the Effective Time.\nNew Management Arrangements\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, there are no employment, equity or other agreements, arrangements or\nunderstandings between any of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers, on the one hand, and Pfizer or the\nSurviving Corporation, on the other hand, and the Merger is not conditioned upon any of the Company\u2019s directors or\nexecutive officers entering into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding.\nFinancing of the Merger",

A person who loses his, her or\nits appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nA holder of record of shares of GBT common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares\nthrough the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise\nwithdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not\nthereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a\nperson who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the\ndemand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement\nthat such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at\nwhich such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery\nList (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of GBT common stock\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the\nDelaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nSection 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\nstockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to\nvote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to\na publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost.

In such case, the demand must set forth the\nnumber of shares of GBT common stock covered by such demand. Where the number of shares of GBT common\nstock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of GBT common stock outstanding in\nthe name of such record owner.\nWithin ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give written notice that the Merger has\nbecome effective to each of (a) each GBT stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who\ndid not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and (b) any beneficial owner who has\ndemanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who\nhas not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and\naccept the Merger Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person\u2019s shares of GBT common stock\nby delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such\nattempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval\nof the Surviving Corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the person within sixty (60) days after the\neffective date, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court will be dismissed as to any person without the approval\nof the Delaware Court, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just. If the\nSurviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is\nrequired, or if the Delaware Court does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the person will be\nentitled to receive only the fair value of such person\u2019s shares of GBT common stock determined by the Delaware\nCourt in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Merger\nConsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation and any\nperson who has properly and timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in\nthe case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe shares of GBT common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the\npart of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise\nappraisal rights should assume that the Company and the Surviving Corporation will not file such a petition or initiate\nany negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of GBT common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to\nhave their shares of GBT common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their\nappraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty\n(120) days after the Effective Time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and\nany person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the\nMerger Agreement.\nIn addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied\nwith the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving\nCorporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of GBT common stock not consented in writing\nor otherwise voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the\nSurviving Corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within\nten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days\nafter the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the Surviving\nCorporation. The Surviving Corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the\noffice of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of GBT common stock and with whom the\nSurviving Corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (which we refer to as the\n\u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and\nplace fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the Surviving Corporation and to all such\nperson set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will\ndetermine which persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided\nthereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of GBT\ncommon stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of GBT common\nstock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any\nperson fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the\nDelaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\npersons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List and may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the\nDelaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of GBT common stock taking into account all relevant factors,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its\ndiscretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound\nquarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time\nand the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving\nCorporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after\nsuch payment only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the\nshares of GBT common stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid\nby the Surviving Corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhen the fair value of the shares of GBT common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of\nsuch value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of\nthe appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an appraisal\ncould result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover,\nthe Surviving Corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any person exercising\nappraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the relevant shares of GBT common stock is less than the Merger Consideration.\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an\nappraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be\nascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.\nSection 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such\nexclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only\nto the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware\nSupreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual\ncircumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness\nfees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a\nperson whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in\nconnection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of GBT\ncommon stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and\naward pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware\nCourt are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any\npurpose any shares of GBT common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to GBT stockholders of record at a date\nprior to the Effective Time.\nAt any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any\nperson without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the\nDelaware Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court\nmade under Section 262(j) of the DGCL\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nperson\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the\nEffective Time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one hundred twenty (120) days after\nthe Effective Time, or if the persons\u2019 otherwise fail to perfect, successfully withdraw or lose such persons\u2019 right to\nappraisal, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled\nonly to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the\nother hand, Section 262 will govern.",

This discussion is\nlimited to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of GBT common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d)\n(generally, property held for investment).

This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations\nother than those pertaining to the income tax (such as the federal estate or gift tax, any alternative minimum tax, or the\napplication of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code) or any state, local or non-\nU.S. income or non-income tax considerations.

Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of GBT\ncommon stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY\nPARTICULAR GBT STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE GBT STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX\nCIRCUMSTANCES.

In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.\nHolder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received\npursuant to the Merger and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of GBT common stock surrendered\npursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of GBT common stock will generally equal the\namount that such U.S. Holder paid for such shares. A U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of GBT\ncommon stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss, and any such capital gain or loss generally will\nbe long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time\nof the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are generally\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a\nU.S. Holder acquired different blocks of GBT common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder\nmust determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of GBT common stock\nthat it holds.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nIn general, subject to the discussion below regarding potential backup withholding, the receipt of cash by a non-U.S.\nHolder in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with a trade or business\nconducted by the non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty,\nis attributable to the non-U.S. Holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear of the Merger and certain other conditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nshares of GBT common stock constitute a United States real property interest by reason of GBT\u2019s status as\na \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code\n(which we refer to as a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date\nof the Effective Time or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held the applicable shares of GBT common\nstock (which we refer to as the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d).\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis\nin substantially the same manner as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty\nprovides otherwise), and if the non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be\nsubject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable\nincome tax treaty) on its \u201ceffectively connected earnings and profits\u201d for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain\nitems.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a\nrate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain recognized, which\ngenerally may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same taxable year (if\nany), provided the non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, GBT believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC during the\nfive-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time. Even if GBT is or was a USRPHC during the Relevant\nPeriod, gain arising from a non-U.S. Holder\u2019s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant\nto the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the GBT common stock is \u201cregularly traded\u201d, as defined\nin applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. Holder owned, actually\nand constructively, 5% or less of the GBT common stock throughout the Relevant Period.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders and non-\nU.S. Holders in connection with the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder\npursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed\nand executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that\nsuch U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise\ncomplies with the backup withholding rules.\nA non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 24%)\nunless the non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS\nForm W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such non-U.S. Holder\u2019s status\nas a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder\nor a non-U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s or non-U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder or non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX\nCONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY\nSTATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF\nTHEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S.\nFEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME, ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS\nAND OF CHANGES IN THOSE TAX LAWS.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",

The approvals required under the Merger Agreement include expiry\nor termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, as well as the receipt of certain non-U.S. antitrust approvals.\n68TABLE OF CONTENTS\nWe currently expect to complete the Merger as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. However, we cannot predict the\nexact timing of completion of the Merger because we cannot guarantee when all required antitrust and other required\nregulatory approvals will be obtained, or if they will be obtained at all.\nU.S. Regulatory Clearances\nUnder the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger has expired or\nbeen terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day\nwaiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade\nCommission (which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer\nto as the \u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a\n\u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day\nwaiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request,\nunless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. GBT made\nthe filing required under the HSR Act on August 26, 2022, and we currently expect Parent to make the filing required\nunder the HSR Act by August 29, 2022, in which case the initial 30-day waiting period will be scheduled to expire at\n11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 28, 2022, unless otherwise extended.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary\nor desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of\nsubstantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take\nsuch action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could\ninclude seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.\nPrivate parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be\ncertain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Clearances\nThe Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approval (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed\nbetween the parties) in Germany (pursuant to the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen\nWettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen)). The parties made the required filings with the German Federal Cartel Office\n(Bundeskartellamt) on August 26, 2022. If, prior to the Effective Time, a merger control inquiry is initiated by a\ngovernmental entity in certain specified jurisdictions, the Merger will also be subject to (a) regulatory approval in\nsuch jurisdiction or (b) confirmation that the inquiry has ended (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between\nthe parties). In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory\nlaws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or\nrequiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. We\ncannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal.\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT",

This compensation is\nsummarized in the section entitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests of GBT\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger\u201d. The Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer\nMerger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, GBT is asking you to\napprove the following resolution:\nRESOLVED, that the stockholders of GBT approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will\nor may become payable to GBT\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as\ndisclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement-Interests of GBT\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement\nProposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve the\nCompensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not\nbe binding on GBT. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the\ncompensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the\nvote on this Compensation Proposal.\nApproval, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the\noutstanding shares of GBT common stock properly cast for the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting,\nprovided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special\nMeeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the\noutcome of the Compensation Proposal and (c) broker \u201cnon-votes\u201d (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the\nCompensation Proposal. shares of GBT common stock of GBT common stock represented by properly executed,\ntimely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a GBT\nstockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of GBT\ncommon stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a\nquorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal.\n92TABLE OF CONTENTS\nPROPOSAL 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL",

Pursuant to the\nAgreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2022 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), among the Company, the Acquiror\nand its subsidiary, Ribeye Acquisition Corp. (\u201cAcquisition Sub\u201d), the Company will merge with and into Acquisition\nSub and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common\nStock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, the\nAcquiror, Acquisition Sub or any other subsidiary of the Acquiror and other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in the\nAgreement), will be converted into the right to receive $68.50 per share in cash (the \u201cConsideration\u201d).\nIn connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement\u037e (ii) reviewed certain publicly available\nbusiness and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates\u037e (iii) compared\nthe proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions\ninvolving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies\u037e (iv) compared the financial\nand operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies\nwe deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and certain\npublicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts\nprepared by or at the direction of the management of the Company relating to its business\u037e and (vi) performed such\nother financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the\npurposes of this opinion.\nIn addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or\nappropriate to our inquiry.\nIn giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We\nhave not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our\nengagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\nhave we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived\ntherefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and\nfinancial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement. We have\nalso assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and\nthe related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal,\nregulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such\nissues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals\nnecessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or\non the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOur opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion\nand that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock\nin the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection\nwith the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company\nor as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion\nwith respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the\nTransaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company\nCommon Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee\nfrom the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed\nTransaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of\nour engagement. Please be advised that during the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our\naffiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking\nrelationships with the Company. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had\ncommercial or investment banking relationships with the Acquiror, for which we and such affiliates have received\ncustomary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint\nbookrunner on the Acquiror\u2019s credit facility in November 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on the Acquiror\u2019s offering\nof debt securities in August 2021. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under\noutstanding credit facilities of the Acquiror, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.\nIn addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each\nof the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade\nthe debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the\nCompany or the Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time\nhold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.\nOn the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid\nto the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders.\nThe issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P.

Parent shall take all steps necessary to provide or cause to be provided to the Paying Agent, on or prior to\nthe Closing Date, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to\nreceive cash pursuant to Section 1.07(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d).\nA-2TABLE OF CONTENTS\n(b)\u2003Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than\nthree business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent\nto mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time\nrepresented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) which were converted into the\nright to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify\nthat delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the\nCertificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are customary\nand reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the\nCertificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for\ncancelation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may\nreasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in\nexchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented\nby such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.07, and the Certificate so surrendered shall\nforthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered\nin the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name\nthe Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in\nproper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other Taxes\nrequired by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have\nestablished to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.\nNone of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for any such\ntransfer or other Taxes.

No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash\npayable upon surrender of any Certificate.\n(c)\u2003Treatment of Book-Entry Shares. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no\nevent later than three business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause\nthe Paying Agent to mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each holder, as of the Effective Time of the Merger,\nof Book-Entry Shares in an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration,\nwithout interest, to which such holder is entitled hereunder.

If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the\noutstanding shares of Company Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for\nCompany Common Stock) shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by\nreason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of\nCompany Common Stock or other similar transaction, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such\nperiod, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable by Parent or the Surviving Corporation\npursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization, stock\nsplit or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, stock dividend or other similar transaction. Nothing in\nthis Section 1.08(d) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or\nrestricted by any other provision of this Agreement.\n(e)\u2003No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance\nwith the terms of this Article I as a result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be\ndeemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.\nAfter the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the\nA-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the\nSurviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in\nthis Article I.\n(f)\u2003Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned\nthereon) that remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered to\nParent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger\nConsideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for\npayment of its claim for such Merger Consideration.\n(g)\u2003No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent\nshall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official\npursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been\nsurrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise\nescheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of\nsuch Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such date, become the\nproperty of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled\nthereto.\n(h)\u2003Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as\ndirected by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be\npaid to Parent. In no event, however, shall such investment or any such payment of interest or income delay the\nreceipt by former holders of Company Common Stock of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such\nholders\u2019 rights hereunder. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the\nExchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent\nto promptly pay the Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall, or\nshall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to\nensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such\npayments.\n(i)\u2003Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit\nof that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the\nposting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity\nagainst any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in\nexchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest.\n(j)\u2003Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving\nCorporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled\nto deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may\nbe required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), or under any other federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so\ndeducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes under\nthis Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.\nARTICLE II\n\u2003\nRepresentations and Warranties of the Company\nExcept as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with, or\nfurnished by the Company to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and publicly available on the\nSEC\u2019s Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System at least one business day prior to the date of this\nAgreement (the \u201cFiled Company SEC Documents\u201d) (excluding any disclosures contained in any part of any Filed\nCompany SEC Document entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d,\ndisclosures of risks set forth in any \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d disclaimer, or any other precautionary or other\nforward-looking statements\u037e it being understood that specific historical factual information contained within such\nheadings, disclosures or statements shall not be excluded) or as set forth in the\nA-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nletter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the \u201cCompany Disclosure Letter\u201d), from the Company to Parent and\nMerger Sub (which shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered\nsections contained in this Article II, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify or apply to other\nsections and subsections in this Article II to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure\nalso qualifies or applies to such other sections and subsections), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and\nMerger Sub as follows:\nSECTION 2.01.
