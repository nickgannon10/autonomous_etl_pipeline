You\nshould read the entire merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on Activision Blizzard\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the applicable\nprovisions of the DGCL, on the closing date and at the effective time, Sub will merge with and into Activision\nBlizzard, with Activision Blizzard continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of\nMicrosoft. Activision Blizzard expects to delist its common stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable\nafter the effective time and deregister its common stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable\nafter such delisting. Thereafter, Activision Blizzard will no longer be a publicly traded company. If the merger\nis completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation, and instead will\nonly be entitled to receive the merger consideration, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConversion of Shares\u202f-\u202fCommon Stock\u201d beginning on page 75.\nThe effective time will occur upon the filing and acceptance of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of\nState of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sub may agree in\nwriting and specify in the certificate of merger).\nEffect on Activision Blizzard if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not completed\nfor any other reason, Activision Blizzard stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock. Instead, Activision Blizzard will remain an independent public company,\nActivision Blizzard common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the\nExchange Act and Activision Blizzard will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nFurthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger\nnot to be consummated, it is likely that the price of Activision Blizzard common stock will decline\nsignificantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Activision Blizzard common stock\nwould return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. If the merger is not\nconsummated, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s business operations, assets and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are\ndeemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the merger agreement is not\nadopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, there\ncan be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Activision Blizzard or its stockholders will be\noffered or that Activision Blizzard\u2019s business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely\nimpacted.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Activision Blizzard will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee\nof $2,270,100,000 upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 92.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Microsoft will be required to pay Activision Blizzard a reverse\ntermination fee of an amount ranging from $2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 upon the termination of the\nmerger agreement, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fReverse\nTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 93.\n31 \n",

For a description of\nthe interests of our directors and executive officers in the merger, see \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision\nBlizzard in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 59. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and\ntook these interests into account when approving the merger agreement and determining that the terms of\nthe merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best\ninterests of Activision Blizzard and its stockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\nconsidered is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\ncollectively reached the conclusion to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, in light of the various factors described above\nand other factors that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors believed were appropriate. In view of the\ncomplexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors did not find it useful to, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or\nspecific weights or values to any of the factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake\nto make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular\nfactor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different\nweights to different factors. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature\nand should be read in light of the factors set forth in \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page\n24.\nFinancial Forecasts\nActivision Blizzard does not, as a matter of course, normally publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal\nprojections as to its future performance, revenue, earnings or other results given, among other reasons, the\nuncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates, including the\ndifficulty of predicting general economic and market conditions, other than, from time to time, estimated\nranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current year and certain future\nyears in its regular earnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with the\nproposed merger, Activision Blizzard\u2019s management provided certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors for purposes of considering and evaluating the\nmerger and the merger agreement and to Activision Blizzard\u2019s financial advisor, Allen & Company. Certain of\nsuch prospective financial information also was shared with Microsoft and its financial advisor in\nconnection with Microsoft\u2019s due diligence review and discussions regarding the merger. Set forth below is a\nsummary of the material unaudited prospective financial information provided by the management of\nActivision Blizzard in connection with the merger. We refer in this proxy statement to such unaudited\nprospective financial information, collectively, as the \u201cprospective financial information.\u201d\nThe prospective financial information was not prepared with a view to public disclosure and is included in\nthis proxy statement only because such information was made available as described above. The prospective\nfinancial information was not prepared with a view to compliance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples as applied in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC\nregarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial\ninformation. The prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is\nthe responsibility of, Activision Blizzard\u2019s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited,\nreviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying\nprospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an\nopinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report\nincorporated by reference in this document relates to Activision Blizzard\u2019s previously issued financial\nstatements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.\nAlthough a summary of the prospective financial information is presented with numerical specificity, the\nprospective financial information reflects numerous forecasts, variables, assumptions and estimates as to\n48 \n",

This compensation will be\nprovided in the form of a cash payment (less applicable taxes) or a new equity award, as reasonably\ndetermined by Microsoft.\nInterests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that you vote to\napprove the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our non-employee directors\nand executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your\ninterests as a stockholder. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and considered these\ninterests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing\nthe negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in\nrecommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Activision Blizzard.\nAccelerated Vesting of Equity Compensation Upon Certain Terminations\nNone of the Activision Blizzard outstanding equity awards provide for \u201csingle trigger\u201d vesting immediately\nat the effective time (i.e., as a result of the merger without a termination of employment). However, under the\nterms of the merger agreement, outstanding RSUs held by non-employee directors at the time of the closing\nof the merger will vest in full and the holder will receive the consideration described above under the section\nentitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u202f\u202f-\u202f\u202fThe Merger\u202f-\u202f Treatment of Equity\nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 57.\nMicrosoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may approve, and the Compensation Committee of the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors (which we refer to as the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) has approved,\nthat options, RSUs and PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement and certain awards\ngranted after the date of the merger agreement that will be outstanding as of closing, as further detailed\nbelow, that are converted at the effective time of the merger to Microsoft unvested options and unvested\nRSUs pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement (such conversion is described above under \u201cTreatment\nof Equity Compensation\u201d), will vest in full on a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d basis (i.e., upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment after a specified period following the effective time of the merger), as follows:\nAny such award that was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement, including to our\nexecutive officers, and certain awards granted after the date of the merger agreement that will be\noutstanding as of closing, will vest in full if, during the 18-month period immediately following the\neffective time, the employee\u2019s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their\nrespective subsidiaries without \u201ccause\u201d or by the employee for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (where \u201ccause\u201d is\ndefined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and \u201cgood reason\u201d is defined\n59 \n",

The Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the following resolution:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the stockholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,\nthe compensation that will or may become payable to Activision Blizzard\u2019s named executive officers that is\nbased on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the\nsection entitled \u2018Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Non-\nEmployee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger\u202f-\u202fGolden Parachute\nCompensation\u2019 in Activision Blizzard\u2019s proxy statement for the special meeting.\u201d\nStockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and, as an\nadvisory vote, the result will not be binding on Activision Blizzard, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\nor Microsoft. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their\nterms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the\nmerger is consummated, our named executive officers will be entitled to receive the compensation that is\nbased on or otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those\npayments.\nVote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation\nApproval of the merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nvoting power of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person\nor by proxy, provided a quorum is present.\nIf you are present at the special meeting in person or by proxy and abstain from voting or otherwise do not\nvote, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger-related compensation proposal. If you are\nnot present at the special meeting in person or by proxy, your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\nwill not be counted as voting power present for purposes of voting on the merger-related compensation\nproposal, and therefore will have no effect on the merger-related compensation proposal. Broker non-votes\nwill have the same effect as not being present at the special meeting, and therefore will have no effect on the\nmerger-related compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).\nThe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger-related\ncompensation proposal.\n95 \n",

The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors authorized and\ndirected management to contact three other strategic parties to assess their interest in a potential\nacquisition of Activision Blizzard that were viewed, with input from Activision Blizzard\u2019s senior\nmanagement and legal and financial advisors, as the most likely potential counterparties that could\ntransact at a level that could potentially deliver greater value to Activision Blizzard stockholders than\nthe Microsoft transaction and that could potentially obtain required regulatory approval and that\nnone of the parties contacted by Activision Blizzard\u2019s management determined to proceed with\nsubstantive discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nOpinion of Activision Blizzard\u2019s Financial Advisor. The opinion, dated January 17, 2022, of Allen &\nCompany to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview and as of such date, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Microsoft, Sub and their respective affiliates)\npursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to the various\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the\nreview undertaken as set forth in such opinion and is more fully described below in the section\nentitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fThe Merger\u202f-\u202fOpinion of Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 52.\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that the\nprovisions of the merger agreement, including the respective representations, warranties and\ncovenants and termination rights of the parties and termination fees payable by Activision Blizzard,\nare reasonable and customary. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also believed that the terms\nof the merger agreement include the most favorable terms reasonably attainable from Microsoft.\nConditions to the Consummation of the Merger\u037e Likelihood of Closing. The fact that the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors considered the reasonable likelihood of the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement in light of the conditions in the merger agreement\nto the obligations of Microsoft, including the exceptions to the events that would constitute a\nmaterial adverse effect on Activision Blizzard for purposes of the merger agreement, as well as\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s ability to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger\nagreement, including to cause the merger to be consummated if all of the conditions to Microsoft\u2019s\nobligations to effect the merger closing have been satisfied or waived.\nRegulatory Approvals. The fact that the merger agreement requires that Microsoft use its reasonable\nbest efforts to take certain actions necessary to obtain regulatory clearance and satisfy the regulatory\nconditions, including the fact that Microsoft agreed to accept potential remedies in order to obtain\nregulatory approval, including Microsoft\u2019s commitment to divest or take other actions with respect to\nbusinesses or assets of Activision Blizzard, unless such additional remedies would reasonably be\nexpected to result in a material adverse impact on Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries, taken as a\nwhole, have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by Microsoft or\nhave more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft, and that, if the\nmerger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain antitrust\napprovals, Microsoft will be required to pay a reverse termination fee of $2,000,000,000 if the notice\nregarding the termination of the merger agreement is delivered during the first 12 months post-\nsigning, $2,500,000,000 if the notice regarding the termination of the merger agreement is delivered\nduring months 13 to 15 post-signing, or $3,000,000,000 if the notice regarding the termination of the\nmerger agreement is delivered after month 15 post-signing.

The prospective financial information is subjective in many respects and, thus, subject to\ninterpretation. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the prospective financial\ninformation not to be achieved include general economic, regulatory, market, financial, competitive, seasonal,\ncyclical and other conditions, trends and developments, industry performance, accuracy of certain\naccounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, the ability to\nattract and retain highly skilled employees, the ability to execute day-to-day operations and other strategic\ninitiatives and other factors described or referenced under the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements\u201d beginning on page 24. Because the prospective financial information covers multiple years,\nsuch information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. In addition, the\nprospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the\ndate that it was prepared and does not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nthe prospective financial information will or would be realized, and actual results may be materially better or\nworse than those contained in the prospective financial information.\nNone of Activision Blizzard or its directors, officers, affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any\nrepresentation to readers of this proxy statement, and has not made any such representation to Microsoft,\nconcerning the ultimate performance of Activision Blizzard or the combined company compared to the\nprospective financial information.

Financial measures\nprovided to a board of directors or a financial advisor are excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures,\nwhich would otherwise require, among other information, a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure\nto a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors or Allen & Company in connection with the merger. Accordingly, a\nreconciliation of the financial measures included in the financial projections is not provided.\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, ACTIVISION\nBLIZZARD DOES NOT INTEND, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY, TO UPDATE OR\nOTHERWISE REVISE THE PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES\nEXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN\nIN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT\nREALIZED AND EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE PROSPECTIVE\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE INAPPROPRIATE.\nLong-Range Plan\nAs part of Activision Blizzard\u2019s ordinary course annual financial planning process, and not in contemplation\nof the merger, the Long-Range Plan for Activision Blizzard\u2019s fiscal years 2021 through 2024 was presented by\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s management to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on October 28, 2021.
