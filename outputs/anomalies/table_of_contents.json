To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APTS2022SM. At the virtual special meeting, holders of our common stock, $0.01\npar value per share, which we refer to as \u201ccommon stock,\u201d as of the record date, which was the close of\n2\nbusiness on April 11, 2022, will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger in accordance\nwith the terms of the merger agreement, which proposal we refer to as the \u201cmerger proposal,\u201d (2) a proposal to approve,\non a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers, which proposal we refer to as the \u201cadvisory compensation\nproposal,\u201d and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting\nadditional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the virtual special meeting to approve the merger proposal, which\nproposal we refer to as the \u201cadjournment proposal.\u201d If the merger is approved by our stockholders and completed as\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\nmerger effective time will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the\nvirtual special meeting.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on April 11, 2022, are\nentitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of\nthe virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual\nspecial meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, our\noutstanding voting securities consisted of 64,341,143 shares of common stock. All holders of record of our preferred\nstock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, but may not vote at, the virtual special\nmeeting.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be\ncast at the virtual special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual\nattendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the virtual special\nmeeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as\nshares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the mergers requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our\ncommon stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual\nspecial meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on. Because the\nrequired vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather\nthan on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special\nmeeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will\nhave the same effect as voting against the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the approval of the adjournment proposal each requires the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to\ncompletion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your\nshares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will\nnot have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will\nhave no effect on the outcome of these proposals.\nThe vote of the holders of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as\n\u201cSeries A preferred stock,\u201d our Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as\n\u201cSeries A1 preferred stock,\u201d our Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as\n\u201cSeries M preferred stock,\u201d and our Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to\nas \u201cSeries M1 preferred stock,\u201d is not required to approve any of the proposals at the virtual special meeting and is not\nbeing solicited. We use the term \u201cpreferred stock\u201d in this proxy statement to refer to the Series A preferred stock, Series\nA1 preferred stock, Series M preferred stock and Series M1 preferred stock, collectively.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately\n1,341,751 shares of our common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 2.09% of the total combined voting\npower of our common stock at the virtual special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that\nthey intend to vote the shares that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation\nproposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.\n3\nProxies\u037e Revocation\nAny of our common stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of\ncommon stock by returning the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through\nthe Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast.

We use the term \u201cSurviving Partnership\u201d in this proxy statement to refer to the Partnership following the\npartnership merger effective time.

At the merger effective time, each earned PSU will be cancelled in\nexchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment\nwithholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned PSU.

To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APTS2022SM. At the virtual special meeting, holders of our common stock, $0.01\npar value per share, which we refer to as \u201ccommon stock,\u201d as of the record date, which was the close of\n2\nbusiness on April 11, 2022, will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the merger in accordance\nwith the terms of the merger agreement, which proposal we refer to as the \u201cmerger proposal,\u201d (2) a proposal to approve,\non a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers, which proposal we refer to as the \u201cadvisory compensation\nproposal,\u201d and (3) a proposal to approve any adjournment of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting\nadditional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the virtual special meeting to approve the merger proposal, which\nproposal we refer to as the \u201cadjournment proposal.\u201d If the merger is approved by our stockholders and completed as\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\nmerger effective time will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the\nvirtual special meeting.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on April 11, 2022, are\nentitled to receive notice of and attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of\nthe virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual\nspecial meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, our\noutstanding voting securities consisted of 64,341,143 shares of common stock. All holders of record of our preferred\nstock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, but may not vote at, the virtual special\nmeeting.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be\ncast at the virtual special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual\nattendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the virtual special\nmeeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as\nshares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the mergers requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our\ncommon stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual\nspecial meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on. Because the\nrequired vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather\nthan on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special\nmeeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will\nhave the same effect as voting against the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the approval of the adjournment proposal each requires the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to\ncompletion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your\nshares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will\nnot have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will\nhave no effect on the outcome of these proposals.\nThe vote of the holders of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as\n\u201cSeries A preferred stock,\u201d our Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as\n\u201cSeries A1 preferred stock,\u201d our Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as\n\u201cSeries M preferred stock,\u201d and our Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to\nas \u201cSeries M1 preferred stock,\u201d is not required to approve any of the proposals at the virtual special meeting and is not\nbeing solicited. We use the term \u201cpreferred stock\u201d in this proxy statement to refer to the Series A preferred stock, Series\nA1 preferred stock, Series M preferred stock and Series M1 preferred stock, collectively.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately\n1,341,751 shares of our common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 2.09% of the total combined voting\npower of our common stock at the virtual special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that\nthey intend to vote the shares that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation\nproposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.\n3\nProxies\u037e Revocation\nAny of our common stockholders of record entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its shares of\ncommon stock by returning the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through\nthe Internet, or by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast.

Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone will not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized\nproxy.\nIf you own common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may revoke or change previously granted voting instructions by\nfollowing the instructions provided by the broker, bank or other nominee that is the registered owner of the shares or\nby attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.\nThe Mergers (page 31)\nPursuant to the merger agreement, on the closing date, Merger Sub II will merge with and into the Partnership and the\nseparate existence of Merger Sub II will cease, and the Partnership will be the surviving partnership in the partnership\nmerger. We use the term \u201cSurviving Partnership\u201d in this proxy statement to refer to the Partnership following the\npartnership merger effective time. The Surviving Partnership will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company\nfollowing the partnership merger effective time.\nThe partnership merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the partnership\nmerger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on such other date and time as may be agreed between\nthe parties to the merger agreement and specified in the partnership certificate of merger.

We use the term \u201cSurviving Company\u201d in this proxy statement to refer to Merger Sub I following the effective\ntime of the merger. The Surviving Company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and the Surviving Partnership\nwill be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Surviving Company following the merger effective time.\nOur merger with Merger Sub I will become effective upon the later of the acceptance for record of the articles of merger\nwith respect to the merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, the filing of the\ncertificate of merger with respect to the merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on such other date\nand time (not to exceed 30 days from the date the articles of merger with respect to the merger are accepted for record\nby the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland) as may be agreed between the parties to the\nmerger agreement and specified in the articles of merger and the company certificate of merger.

LLC\nAt the February 16, 2022 meeting of the board of directors, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) rendered to\nthe board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the\neffect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and\nassumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to\nthe holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was\nfair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 16, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection\nwith Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy\nstatement by reference in its entirety. The summary of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion contained in this proxy statement is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 advisory\nservices and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors in connection with its\nconsideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the opinion does not constitute a\nrecommendation as to how any holder of shares of common stock should vote with respect to the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter.\nPursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay Goldman\nSachs a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of the\nmerger agreement, to be approximately $36 million, $1 million of which was payable upon announcement of the merger\nagreement, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement.\nTreatment of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants, Time-Vested Restricted Stock, Performance\nStock Units and Restricted Stock Units (page 68)\nCommon Stock\nThe merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of common stock, or fraction thereof,\nissued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of common stock held by\nthe Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries\n(collectively, \u201cexcluded common stock\u201d)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to $25.00 per share, without interest (such per share amount, the \u201ccommon stock consideration\u201d)\nand less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded common stock will be automatically retired and will cease to exist\nwith no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the merger.\nIf we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid\nor reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger\nagreement, the common stock consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such\ndividend on the common stock.\nPreferred Stock\nThe merger agreement provides that, at the merger effective time, each share of preferred stock, or fraction thereof,\nissued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time (other than shares of preferred stock held by\nthe Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the Parent Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries\n(collectively, \u201cexcluded preferred stock\u201d)) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to $1,000.00 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the closing\ndate, with respect thereto, without interest (such per share amount, the \u201cpreferred stock\n5\nconsideration\u201d) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded preferred stock will be automatically retired and will\ncease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with, or as a consequence of, the\nmerger.\nCompany Warrants\nPrior to the merger effective time, we will amend the agreements (which we refer to as the \u201cwarrant agreements\u201d)\ngoverning the outstanding warrants to purchase common stock (which we refer to as \u201ccompany warrants\u201d) effective as\nof the merger effective time, such that each holder of a company warrant that is thereafter exercisable, but not exercised\nas of the merger effective time, shall be entitled, upon exercise, to receive in respect of each share of common stock\nunderlying such company warrant only an amount of cash equal to the difference between the common stock\nconsideration and the exercise price (as set forth in the applicable warrant agreement) for each such share (such per\nshare amount, the \u201ccompany warrant amount\u201d). Prior to the merger effective time, we will notify the warrant agent in\naccordance with the warrant agreements (as amended) with respect to the outstanding company warrants that, as of the\nmerger effective time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective\ntime (other than excluded common stock) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the common stock\nconsideration, and that the terms of the company warrants will be adjusted so that the holder of any company warrant\nexercised after such date shall be entitled to receive in cash the company warrant amount only with respect to each\nshare of common stock underlying such company warrant immediately prior to the merger effective time.\nTime-Vested Restricted Stock\nThe merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding share of unvested\ntime-vested restricted common stock (which we refer to as a \u201ctime-vested restricted stock\u201d) granted pursuant to the\nCompany\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan or the Company\u2019s 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (which we refer to collectively as the\n\u201clong-term incentive plans\u201d) will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights thereon\nwill lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all\npurposes under the merger agreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any\napplicable withholding taxes.\nPerformance Stock Units\nThe merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding award of\nunvested performance-based restricted stock unit (which we refer to as a \u201cperformance stock unit\u201d) granted pursuant to\nthe long-term incentive plans, which remains subject to vesting based all or in part on future achievement of\nperformance goals, will become earned and vested with respect to that number of shares of common stock subject to\nsuch performance stock unit in accordance with the terms of such performance stock unit (but without applying any\npro-ration for the number of days of employment during the shortened performance period ending on the closing date)\nbased on the achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth in the award agreement governing such\nperformance stock unit (as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors) as measured from the\nbeginning of the applicable performance period through the closing date (or the latest practicable date prior thereto that\nperformance can be assessed) (each such earned performance stock unit, and each other outstanding performance\nstock unit for which the applicable performance period completed prior to the closing date but which remains subject to\nservice vesting conditions, an \u201cearned PSU\u201d). At the merger effective time, each earned PSU will be cancelled in\nexchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment\nwithholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned PSU. Additionally, in no event later than\nfive business days after the merger effective time or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse\ntax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, we will pay to each holder of earned PSUs an amount equal to all\naccrued and unpaid cash dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes. Each performance stock unit that\ndoes not become an earned PSU will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe merger agreement provides that (1) each restricted stock unit that vests upon the satisfaction of service conditions\nand becomes earned based on our market capitalization increases relevant to target market thresholds (which we refer to\nas a \u201cmarket cap restricted stock unit\u201d) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time and\nthat is a vested market cap restricted stock unit that becomes an \u201cEarned RSU\u201d (as defined in the award agreement\ngoverning such market cap restricted stock unit) prior to the merger effective time (which we refer to as an \u201cearned\nRSU\u201d), and (2) each restricted stock unit subject to a service-based vesting requirement granted under the long-term\nincentive plans (which we refer to as a \u201ctime-vested RSU\u201d and, together with the time-vested restricted stock, the\nperformance stock units and market cap restricted stock units, the \u201ccompensatory awards\u201d) (whether vested or\nunvested) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the merger effective time, will be cancelled in exchange for\nthe right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding\ntaxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned RSU or time-\n6\nvested RSU (as applicable). Any issued and outstanding market cap restricted stock unit that is not an earned RSU as\nof immediately prior to the merger effective time will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger\neffective time.\nTreatment of Interests in the Partnership (page 69)\nClass A Partnership Units\nThe merger agreement provides that, at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A unit of the Partnership, or\nfraction thereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than\nClass A partnership units held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, Merger\nSub II or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cexcluded Class A partnership units\u201d)) will be\nautomatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the common stock\nconsideration, without interest (such per unit amount, the \u201cpartnership unit consideration\u201d) and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes. Class A partnership units, general partnership interests in the Partnership, and Series A redeemable\npreferred units of the Partnership, Series A1 redeemable preferred units of the Partnership, Series M redeemable\npreferred units of the Partnership and Series M1 redeemable preferred units of the Partnership (which we refer to\ncollectively as \u201cpreferred partnership units\u201d), in each case, held by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany will be unaffected by the partnership merger and will remain outstanding as partnership units of the Surviving\nPartnership held by the Company or the relevant wholly owned subsidiary. Class A partnership units and preferred\npartnership units held by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries will be\nautomatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection with,\nor as a consequence of, the partnership merger.\nAs discussed above, if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under\nthe Code, or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted\nunder the merger agreement, the partnership unit consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share\namount of such dividend on the common stock.\nClass B Partnership Units\nThe merger agreement provides that each vested Class B Unit of the Partnership, which we refer to as the \u201cClass B\npartnership units,\u201d or fraction thereof, that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the partnership merger\neffective time that becomes an \u201cEarned Class B Unit\u201d (pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement) and\nwhich has a \u201cCapital Account\u201d (as defined in the partnership agreement (as defined below)) equal to the \u201cAverage\nCapital Account Balance\u201d (as defined in the partnership agreement) (taking into account any allocations that would be\ndeemed to occur pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement) will automatically be converted into a Class A\npartnership unit at the partnership merger effective time. Pursuant to the award agreements, all of the Class B\npartnership units became Earned Class B Units and converted into Class A partnership units on March 31, 2022, and as\nsuch, the provisions in the merger agreement applicable to the conversion of unvested Class B partnership units no\nlonger apply.\nThis proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the partnership merger, and does\nnot constitute an offer to exchange the Class A partnership units.\nTreatment of Interests in Operations (page 70)\nThe merger agreement provides that, at the operations merger effective time, each preferred share of Operations (which\nwe refer to as \u201coperations preferred shares\u201d) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the operations merger\neffective time (other than operations preferred shares held by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or by the\nParent Parties or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cexcluded operations preferred shares\u201d and, together with\nexcluded common stock, excluded preferred stock and excluded Class A partnership units, the \u201cexcluded securities\u201d))\nwill be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $1,100.00 per share,\nplus any accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the closing date, with respect thereto (such per share\namount, the \u201coperations preferred share consideration\u201d and, together with the common stock consideration, the\npreferred stock consideration and the partnership unit consideration, the \u201cmerger consideration\u201d), less any applicable\nwithholding taxes. Each common share of Operations held by any person and each excluded operations preferred share\nwill be automatically retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being paid with respect thereto in connection\nwith, or as a consequence of, the operations merger.\nThis proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the operations merger.\n7\nFinancing (page 54)\nIn connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $3.5 billion to be paid to\nthe holders of common stock (assuming the cash exercise of all outstanding company warrants), preferred stock, time-\nvested restricted stock, earned PSUs, earned RSUs, time-vested RSUs, Class A partnership units and operations\npreferred shares (in each case other than excluded securities). Parent has informed us that in connection with the\nclosing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any,\nto be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding.\nAs of April 11, 2022 we had no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and as of March 31, 2022 we had\napproximately $2.4 billion in mortgage loans outstanding.\nParent has informed us that it currently intends to pursue obtaining debt financing to be provided in connection with\nthe mergers. In addition, it is expected that BREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the\n\u201cSponsor\u201d), which is the operating partnership of BREIT, and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the\npurpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt\nfinancing.\nParent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the\ndebt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt,\nfunding working capital requirements, and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent\nhas informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt financing would be\nsecured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us,\ncertain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their\ninterests in the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being\ncompleted and other customary conditions for similar financings.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of the\nmergers. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their\ncommercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in\nconnection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries, or our or our subsidiaries\u2019 real\nproperty. For more information, see the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Financing Cooperation\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers.\u201d\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (page 54)\nOur directors and executive officers have certain interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those\nof our stockholders generally. See \u201cThe Mergers-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d for\ninformation about interests that our directors and executive officers have in the mergers that are different than yours.\nRestriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals (page 80)\nThe \u201cGo-Shop\u201d Period: Solicitation of Competing Proposals\nUntil 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 18, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201cno-shop period start date\u201d), we and\nour subsidiaries and representatives had the right to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry (as defined\nbelow in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals\u201d) that\nconstitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a competing proposal (as defined below in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Stockholders\u2019 Meeting\u201d), including by providing non-public information regarding the\nCompany to any person pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, subject to certain other requirements, and\nengage in any discussions or negotiations with any persons and their respective representatives with respect to a\ncompeting proposal or potential competing proposal or interest or potential interest with respect thereto, or otherwise\ncooperate with, assist or participate in, or facilitate any inquiries. Within one business day after the no-shop period\nstart date, we were required to notify Parent of the identity of each person from whom we received a competing\nproposal during such period, including any excluded parties (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals\u201d), and provide Parent with a copy of such competing\nproposal and any other written terms or proposals.\nThe \u201cNo-Shop\u201d Period: No Solicitation of Competing Proposals\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the no-shop period start date, other than as permitted with\nrespect to excluded parties (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of\nCompeting Proposals\u201d), we and our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on our ability to solicit any competing\nproposal or inquiry, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or\nencourage, provide any non-public information or take any other action for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating,\nany competing proposal or inquiry, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or\n8\nnegotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging\nor facilitating, any competing proposal or inquiry, or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement (as defined below in\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals\u201d), or resolve, propose\nor agree to do any of the foregoing. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we may participate or engage in\ndiscussions or negotiations with, and furnish information (including non-public information) to, any person that has\nmade, renewed or delivered to us a bona fide written competing proposal after the date of the merger agreement and\nprior to obtaining the stockholder approval (that did not result from a breach

Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation\u201d), if our board of directors\ndetermines in good faith (after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing\nproposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as\ndefined below in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals\u201d).\nUnder certain circumstances and after following certain procedures and adhering to certain restrictions, we are\npermitted to

providing for the\nimplementation of a superior proposal (provided that such termination will not be effective until we have paid the\ncompany termination payment (as described below in the section

The Stein Lawsuit asserts, on\nbehalf of an individual plaintiff, (1) a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and its implementing\nregulations, alleging that purported omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading\u037e and (2) a \u201ccontrol\nperson\u201d claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violation. The Stein Lawsuit\nalleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including line items used to calculate non-\nGAAP financial metrics, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, levered free cash flow\ninformation, and input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Stein\nLawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a)\nof the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from\nproceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated,\nand an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe Wang Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors. Like the Stein Lawsuit, the\nWang Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section\n20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the\nsame allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as the Stein Lawsuit.\nThe Anderson Lawsuit, like the Stein Lawsuit and Wang Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the\nCompany\u2019s directors. The Anderson Lawsuit also asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all\ndefendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The\nAnderson Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain\nfinancial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to\nGAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis, the Company\u2019s nondisclosure agreements\nwith potential counterparties, and details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company\u2019s\nofficers and directors. The Anderson Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, a\ndeclaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, rescission of the merger and an\naward of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe Hopkins Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit alleges that the\nproxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to\ncalculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and\nassumptions used in Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis, the Company\u2019s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties,\ninformation relating to the Company\u2019s engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., and details regarding any\ndiscussions about the future employment of the Company\u2019s officers and directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit also alleges\nthat the Company\u2019s officers stand to benefit from the merger and that the price of the merger is unfair. Relying on those\nallegations, the Hopkins Lawsuit asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors and a claim for\ndeclaratory and equitable relief against all defendants.\nThe Ferguson Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit, like the Stein,\nWang, and Anderson Lawsuits, asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a\nclaim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors.

In addition, because the merger proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the\nholders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting,\nyour failure to authorize your proxy or voting instructions or to vote at the virtual special meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe approval of the merger proposal.\nQ: How does the common stock consideration compare to the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock?\nA: The merger consideration of $25.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 39% over the unaffected closing price of our common stock\non February 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to the publishing of a media article reporting that the Company was exploring strategic options\nincluding a full or partial sale after receiving\n17\ninbound interest, and a premium of approximately 60% over the 90-day volume weighted average share price ended February 9, 2022.\nQ: How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?\nA: Our board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal, and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadjournment proposal.\nQ: Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the advisory compensation proposal?\nA: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the \u201cSEC,\u201d has adopted rules that require companies to seek a nonbinding,\nadvisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise\nrelates to corporate transactions such as the merger.\nQ: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?\nA: The vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Approval\nof this proposal is not a condition to completion of the mergers. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or\nour board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nAccordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the mergers are completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive\nthe compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.\nQ: Do any of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have any interest in the mergers that is different than mine?\nA: Our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those interests of our\nstockholders generally. See \u201cThe Mergers\u202f-\u202fInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d for information about interests that\nour directors and executive officers have in the mergers that are different than yours.\nQ: What do I need to do now?\nA: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the annexes attached to this proxy statement,\nplease vote your shares or authorize a proxy to vote your shares in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. Holders of our common\nstock will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned as of the record date.\nQ: How do I cast my vote?\nA: If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your\nshares at the virtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the\naccompanying pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope, or, if you prefer, by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or Internet\nproxy authorization. If the telephone or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less costly.\nRegistered stockholders can transmit their voting instructions by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 or on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com.\nTelephone and Internet voting are available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day immediately prior to the virtual special meeting.\nHave your proxy card with you if you are going to authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. To authorize your proxy by mail,\nplease complete sign, date and mail your proxy card in the envelope provided.\nQ: How do I cast my vote if my common stock is held of record in \u201cstreet name\u201d?\nA: If you own common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance\nwith the instructions on the voting instruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, since brokers, banks and other\nnominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement. If you have not\nreceived such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee\nwho can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at\nthe virtual special meeting.\n18\nQ: What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?\nA: With respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold\nyour shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. With respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting,\nfail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to\nyour broker, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals.\nQ: How will proxy holders vote my common stock?\nA: If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but no\ndirection is otherwise made, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadjournment proposal. Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual\nspecial meeting.\nQ: What happens if I sell my common stock before the virtual special meeting?\nA: If you held shares of common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain your right to vote at\nthe virtual special meeting, but not the right to receive the common stock consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration\nwhen the merger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares you previously owned.\nQ: Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?\nA: Yes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it is\nexercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at\nthe virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you\nhave instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for changing your vote do not apply and instead you\nmust follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote or you may attend and vote at the virtual special\nmeeting.\nQ: Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?\nA: Yes. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock and preferred stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as a\ndistribution in complete liquidation of the Company and will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S.\nholder of shares of common stock or preferred stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to\nthe difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received with respect to such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock or preferred stock in the\nmerger, and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of the merger will\ndepend on various factors, including whether the receipt of such payments is treated as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain\nfrom the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the provisions of FIRPTA. See \u201cThe Mergers - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences -\nConsequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\u201d and \u201c-Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Shares of\nPreferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to non-U.S. holders. You should consult\nyour tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application\nand effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see \u201cThe Mergers - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences.\u201d\nQ: What rights do I have if I oppose the merger?\nA: If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are not, however, entitled to\nexercise any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares in\nconnection with the merger. Because shares of our common stock were listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled\nto vote at the virtual special meeting, pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law, our common stockholders who object to the merger do\nnot have any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. For more information, see\n\u201cNo Dissenters\u2019 Rights of Appraisal.\u201d\n19\nQ: Where can I find the voting results of the virtual special meeting?\nA: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the virtual special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will\nbe filed with the SEC following the virtual special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC\u2019s website at\nwww.sec.gov when filed.\nQ: Can I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?\nA: If you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card, or authorize your\nproxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.\nQ: Have any stockholders already agreed to approve the merger?\nA: No. To our knowledge, none of our common stockholders have entered into any agreement to vote any of their shares of common stock either in\nfavor or against any proposal at the virtual special meeting.\nQ: Where can I find more information about the Company?\nA: We file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.pacapts.com. The\ninformation found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or\nany other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents from us. For more information, see\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA: We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the virtual special meeting. Our board of directors is soliciting your proxy on our behalf. In\naddition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our directors, officers and\nother employees. We have engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc., which we refer to as \u201cMacKenzie Partners,\u201d to assist in the solicitation of proxies for\na fee of $50,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their names,\nor in the names of their nominees, that are beneficially owned by others to send or cause to be sent proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from,\nsuch beneficial owners and will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.\nQ: Who can help answer my other questions?\nA: If after reading this proxy statement you have more questions about the virtual special meeting or the mergers, you should contact us at:\nPreferred Apartment Communities, Inc.\n3284 Northside Parkway NW\nSuite 150\nAtlanta, Georgia 30327\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\n(770) 818-4100\nYou may also contact MacKenzie Partners, our proxy solicitor, as follows:\nMacKenzie Partners, Inc. \nEmail: proxy@mackenziepartners.com\nToll-Free: (800) 322-2885\nIf your broker holds your shares, you should also contact your broker for additional information.\n20\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis proxy statement and the documents that we incorporate by reference herein contain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (which we refer to as the\n\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act).

Because\nthe required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number\nof votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct\nyour broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal.\n28"

            "page_content": "THE SPECIAL MEETING\nDate, Time and Purpose of the Special Meeting\nThis proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors to be exercised\nat a virtual special meeting to be held on June 7, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APTS2022SM. The virtual special meeting will be held in a virtual-only meeting format. You will be required\nto enter a control number, included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive, which will allow you to\nparticipate in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of the record date.\nThe purpose of the virtual special meeting is for you to consider and vote on the following matters:\n1. To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. with and into Pike Merger Sub I LLC\npursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 16, 2022, as it may be amended from time to time, by and among\nPike Parent LLC, Pike Merger Sub I LLC, Pike Merger Sub II LLC, Pike Merger Sub III LLC, Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., Preferred\nApartment Communities Operating Partnership, L.P., and PAC Operations, LLC\u037e\n2. To consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our\nnamed executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers\u037e and\n3. To consider and vote on a proposal to approve any adjournment of the virtual special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if\nthere are not sufficient votes at the virtual special meeting to approve the merger proposal.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of virtual special meeting may be brought before the virtual special meeting. The\naffirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the\nvirtual special meeting is required to approve the merger proposal and for the mergers to occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as\nAnnex A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on April 11, 2022, are entitled to receive notice of\nand attend and vote at the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock\nis entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the\nrecord date. On the record date, our outstanding voting securities consisted of 64,341,143 shares of common stock. All holders of record of our\npreferred stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, but may not vote at, the virtual special meeting.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the virtual\nspecial meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the virtual special meeting. Virtual attendance at the virtual special meeting constitutes\npresence in person for quorum purposes at the virtual special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the virtual special meeting.\nAbstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the mergers requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-\nthirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one\nvote on each matter presented at the virtual special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. Because\nthe required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number\nof votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct\nyour broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal.\n28\nIn addition, the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of\nthe votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the mergers. For the purpose of each of these\nproposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will\nhave no effect on the outcome of these proposals.\nAccordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must either return the enclosed proxy card, authorize your\nproxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet or vote at the virtual special meeting. The vote of the holders of our preferred\nstock is not required to approve any of the proposals at the virtual special meeting and is not being solicited.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 1,341,751 shares of our\ncommon stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 2.09% of the total combined voting power of our common stock at the virtual special\nmeeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the shares of our common stock that they own in favor of\nthe merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to\ndo so.\nVotes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the virtual\nspecial meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock represented at the virtual special meeting,\nvirtually or by proxy.\nHow to Authorize a Proxy\nHolders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following methods:\n\u2022mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail\u037e\n\u2022authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions included with your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast.\nRegardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares as described above as\npromptly as possible.\nUnder NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the virtual special\nmeeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the broker, bank or other\nnominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a\nparticular proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own common stock through a\nbroker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on the voting\ninstruction card that your broker, bank or other nominee provides to you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting\nauthority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to\nhow to vote your shares following the directions contained in such voting instruction card. If you have not received such voting instructions or\nrequire further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to\nvote your shares. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also vote at the virtual special meeting. Because the\nmerger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all of the votes entitled to\nbe cast on the matter at the virtual special meeting, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. Because the approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment\nproposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal, and because your bank, broker or other nominee does\nnot have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will\nhave no effect on approval of either proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nProxies and Revocation\nIf you authorize a proxy, your shares will be voted at the virtual special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If no instructions are indicated when\nyou authorize your proxy, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of directors\nrecommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\n29"

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub II will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership\ncontinuing as the Surviving Partnership. Immediately following the partnership merger effective time, Operations will merge with and into Merger\nSub III, with Merger Sub III continuing as the Surviving Operations Entity. Immediately following the operations merger effective time, we will\nmerge with and into Merger Sub I, with Merger Sub I continuing as the Surviving Company.\nThis proxy statement does not constitute any solicitation of consents in respect of the partnership merger or the operations merger, and does not\nconstitute an offer to exchange any Class A partnership units.\nBackground of the Mergers\nOur board of directors regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans and reviews possible ways of increasing long-term\nstockholder value. As part of these evaluations, our board of directors periodically assesses the Company\u2019s competitive position and actively\nmonitors industry trends, our short- and long-term operating performance, our stock price performance, and potential strategic and financial\ninitiatives. As part of these reviews, our board of directors has noted our need to frequently raise capital due to the capital-intensive nature of our\nbusiness, the cost of obtaining such capital, the substantial amount of our outstanding preferred stock and debt, and challenges in acquiring\nmultifamily properties on an accretive basis in light of low capitalization rates and prices for multifamily residential real estate being at or near\nhistoric highs. Based on these evaluations, since 2020 we embarked on a strategy to simplify our business model, lower our capital requirements,\nreduce leverage, and focus on market segments with higher growth opportunities, which resulted in the internalization of our management, the sale\nof both our student housing asset class (completed in November 2020) and the significant majority of our office asset class (completed in July-\nNovember 2021) and focus on high-quality Sunbelt multifamily assets. The closing price of our common stock on September 24, 2020, the date we\nannounced the sale of our student housing asset class, was $5.40 per share of common stock. The divestitures of our student housing and the\noffice property assets in particular provided the Company with capital to use towards asset acquisitions and real estate loan investments in support\nof suburban multifamily communities in the Sunbelt region, and the redemption of approximately $660 million of our preferred stock.\nFrom time to time, representatives of the Company, including Joel Murphy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have met with executives of\nother companies in the real estate industry, including Blackstone, to discuss industry developments and possible opportunities for transactions.\nOn November 5, 2021, Jacob Werner, Co-Head of Americas Acquisitions for Blackstone Real Estate, contacted Mr. Murphy indicating that Mr.\nWerner was going to be in Atlanta the following week and inquired as to whether Mr. Murphy had some time to catch-up. Mr. Murphy had planned\nto be in New York at the end of that week and suggested they meet at such time. On November 11, Messrs. Murphy and Werner had breakfast\nduring which Mr. Werner stated that Blackstone was impressed with the Company and its Sunbelt platform and that Blackstone would like to\nexplore a potential acquisition of the Company. He indicated that, based on its review of publicly available information, Blackstone believed it could\nacquire the Company at a significant premium to the Company\u2019s current stock price. No specific terms of a potential transaction were discussed.\nFollowing the breakfast, Mr. Murphy telephoned Mr. McLure, our lead independent director, and the Company\u2019s outside counsel, Vinson & Elkins\nLLP (\u201cV&E\u201d), to inform them of this conversation. On November 10, 2021, the closing price of our common stock was $13.87 per share.\nOn November 22, 2021, Mr. Werner contacted Mr. Murphy and requested a time to follow up on their prior conversation. Mr. Murphy suggested\nwaiting until after Thanksgiving. Mr. Murphy informed Mr. McLure and V&E of this outreach and, with the approval of Mr. McLure, called Goldman\nSachs for advice. Mr. Murphy contacted Goldman Sachs based on its knowledge of and experience with the Company in light of having regularly\nadvised us on a range of matters, including the sale of our office assets during 2021 and capital markets generally.\nOn December 6, 2021, Mr. Werner asked Mr. Murphy whether he would be available to meet in Atlanta the next day.

Mr. Murphy apprised Mr.\nMcLure and representatives of V&E and Goldman Sachs of this request, and Mr. McLure authorized Mr. Murphy to meet with Mr. Werner.\n31\nOn December 7, 2021, Messrs. Murphy and Werner met over breakfast in Atlanta during which time Mr. Werner reiterated Blackstone\u2019s interest in\nexploring a potential acquisition of the Company. He indicated that Blackstone had devoted a substantial amount of time to analyzing the Company,\nthat Blackstone had sufficient equity capital to complete a transaction and that Blackstone anticipated being able to pay $4 to $5 per share in cash\nabove the Company\u2019s then market price per share, but did not reference any other terms. He requested that the Company enter into a confidentiality\nagreement and provide non-public information in order for Blackstone to learn more about the Company so that it could provide a more specific\nproposal. Mr. Murphy noted that he was very confident in the Company\u2019s standalone plan and the progress the Company had made over the last\ntwo years. Following this meeting, Mr. Murphy updated Mr. McLure and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and King & Spalding LLP\n(\u201cK&S\u201d), outside counsel for the Company. Mr. Murphy asked Goldman Sachs to prepare preliminary financial analyses to assist our board of\ndirectors in deciding whether to pursue a potential transaction with Blackstone. On December 6, 2021, the closing price of the our common stock\nwas $13.56 per share.\nOn December 10, 2021, during a previously scheduled board of directors meeting, which was attended by John Isakson, our Chief Financial Officer,\nand a representative of V&E, Mr. Murphy summarized his discussions with Mr. Werner. The directors and Mr. Isakson discussed Blackstone\u2019s\ndesire to enter into a confidentiality agreement in order to review non-public information, as well as process and timing considerations if we were to\nengage in discussions with Blackstone, including the benefits and risks of reaching out to other potential acquirers. Following this discussion, the\ndirectors unanimously agreed that the best course of action would be to seek Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial advice regarding a potential sale of the\nCompany, as well as its views as to the best process to explore a sale, and other potential strategic alternatives for the Company.\nOn December 15, 2021, as directed by our board of directors, Mr. Murphy contacted Mr. Werner to inform him that the Company was considering\nBlackstone\u2019s interest in a transaction and would respond once our board of directors had decided how it would like to proceed, which would not be\nuntil after the first of the year.\nOn December 20, 2021, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E\nand K&S in attendance. A representative of V&E reviewed the directors\u2019 duties under Maryland law in connection with a potential acquisition of\nthe Company and provided an overview of a typical process for a public company merger transaction. The directors engaged in a discussion with\nGoldman Sachs regarding, among other things, Blackstone\u2019s historical capital raising activities and available capital, Blackstone\u2019s interest in\nmultifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region as evidenced by Blackstone\u2019s agreement to acquire Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.\n(\u201cBluerock\u201d) announced earlier that day, the price Blackstone agreed to pay in the Bluerock transaction and the impact of such transaction on the\nprice of our common stock, the potential treatment of our preferred stock in a transaction with Blackstone and whether the amount of preferred\nstock outstanding and leverage could impact the price per common share at which Blackstone might be willing to acquire the Company. After\ndiscussion, our board of directors requested that Goldman Sachs prepare a preliminary financial analysis of the Company and continue to analyze\nBlackstone\u2019s potential interest in a transaction and other strategic alternatives for discussion at the next board of directors meeting.\nFollowing the board of directors meeting on December 20, 2021, the Company received a notice (the \u201cnomination notice\u201d) from Arkhouse Securities\nLLC and its affiliates Arkhouse Securities II and Arkhouse Partners LLC (collectively, \u201cArkhouse\u201d) setting forth Arkhouse\u2019s desire to replace five\nof the eight directors on the Company\u2019s board of directors with five of its own named nominees and effectively obtain control of the Company\nthrough its nominees. Our board of directors was made aware of the nominations. Arkhouse\u2019s outside counsel stated in the correspondence\naccompanying the nomination notice that Arkhouse intended to engage privately and constructively with the Company regarding its thoughts on\nopportunities to enhance value for our stockholders, but did not provide any detail on these opportunities. V&E initiated several phone calls and\ncorrespondence with Arkhouse\u2019s outside counsel in December 2021 and January 2022 to determine the reason Arkhouse believed it needed to make\nnominations related to the Company\u2019s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders (the \u201cAnnual Meeting\u201d) and to schedule an initial meeting between the\nCompany and Arkhouse. Given the deadline of December 22, 2021 for nominating directors for the Annual Meeting as set out in the Company\u2019s\nproxy statement for its 2021 annual meeting, outside counsel for Arkhouse confirmed to V&E that Arkhouse had made nominations to retain\noptionality if it later believed it would be necessary to contest the election of five directors at the Annual Meeting. Arkhouse\u2019s outside counsel did\nnot express any underlying grievance or criticisms Arkhouse may have had that played any role in it submitting nominations.\n32\nOn December 31, 2021, after the close of trading on the NYSE, Reuters published an article reporting that Arkhouse was seeking to take control of\nthe Company and had nominated five individuals to serve as directors (the \u201cReuters Article\u201d). On December 31, 2021, the closing price of our\ncommon stock was $18.06 per share.\nOn January 5, 2022, Mr. Werner contacted a representative of Goldman Sachs to reiterate Blackstone\u2019s interest in exploring a transaction with the\nCompany, but did not provide any specific terms.\nOn January 21, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and\nK&S in attendance. Mr. Murphy summarized the work that our management team and Goldman Sachs had performed regarding various strategic\nalternatives for the Company. A representative of V&E reviewed the directors\u2019 duties under Maryland law in connection with a potential acquisition\nof the Company. Our management then reviewed and discussed with our board of directors a preliminary draft of our five-year projections for 2022\nthrough 2026 and the assumptions used to prepare such projections. Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with our board of directors their\npreliminary financial analysis of the Company as well as other strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including remaining a\nstandalone independent public company or selling certain or all of our grocery-anchored retail assets. A discussion ensued among the directors,\nmanagement, our outside counsel and financial advisor regarding, among other things, the benefits and risks related to each of the potential\nstrategic alternatives\u037e indicative capitalization rates from recent transactions in the REIT industry\u037e the substantial amount of our preferred stock\nand debt, including significant property level debt\u037e our need to frequently raise capital due to the capital-intensive nature of our business\u037e the cost\nof obtaining capital\u037e and challenges of acquiring multifamily properties on an accretive basis in the current environment.\nOur board of directors also discussed with management and our advisors the benefits and risks of to the Company and its business posed by\ncontacting other potential bidders before announcing any transaction and the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were\nto be sold. These potential risks and considerations included the fact that Blackstone might be able to realize more value from the business than\nother potential acquirers and thereby pay a higher price to acquire the Company due to, among other reasons, Blackstone\u2019s low cost of capital,\nsubstantial available capital and interest in multifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region\u037e the limited universe of other potential third parties\nwith the financial ability to acquire the Company without obtaining financing from third parties in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all\nof our common and preferred stock\u037e the fact that the large amount of our preferred stock and debt could negatively impact the price for our common\nstock that other bidders may be willing to pay\u037e and concerns that soliciting additional potential bidders could result in market leaks and rumors\nregarding a potential transaction which would disrupt our business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our\nstockholder base and potential stock price volatility. Following this discussion, the directors determined that expediting any transaction process\nwould be important to minimize risks to the Company, protect its business and maximize stockholder value, but that the Company should solicit\ninterest from other potential bidders, either prior to or following signing a definitive merger agreement, in order to maximize shareholder value.\nAfter discussion, our board of directors determined to explore a potential transaction with Blackstone and authorized the Company to enter into a\nconfidentiality agreement with Blackstone and provide it with due diligence materials so that Blackstone could provide a proposal with more\nspecific terms. Our board decided that Goldman Sachs should conduct negotiations with Blackstone under the direction of the directors, and\ninstructed Goldman Sachs to inform Blackstone that the Company was prepared to engage on a potential transaction with Blackstone. Our board\nalso directed members of management to refrain from having discussions with Blackstone regarding the roles or compensation, if any, of\nmanagement following the closing of a negotiated transaction.\nFollowing the January 21, 2022 board of directors meeting, our management team prepared an updated version of our five-year projections for 2022\nthrough 2026, reflecting the 2022 budget and 2021 actual data (the \u201cfinancial projections\u201d), which are discussed in more detail under \u201c-Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information\u201d.\nOn January 24, 2022, as directed by our board of directors, a representative of Goldman Sachs called Mr. Werner and indicated that our board of\ndirectors was interested in continuing discussions regarding the terms of a potential transaction. Mr. Werner indicated that Blackstone expected to\npay a meaningful premium to our common stock trading price, but did not provide a specific price or other terms. The representative of Goldman\nSachs indicated that our board of directors was considering whether, if discussions with Blackstone progressed, to contact additional potential\nbidders prior to entering into any transaction. Mr. Werner indicated that Blackstone was not\n33\ninterested in participating in a pre-signing market check. Its willingness to pay a meaningful premium assumed the Company would not be\nconcurrently negotiating with other parties. The Company would, however, be able to solicit other bids during a post-signing \u201cgo-shop\u201d period\nwhere there would be a low termination fee payable if the Company accepted another bid.\nOn January 24, 2022, Blackstone announced its agreement to acquire Resource REIT, Inc. (\u201cResource\u201d) for $14.75 per share in an all-cash\ntransaction valued at approximately $3.7 billion. Resource owns various multifamily properties located in the Sunbelt region.\nOn January 26, 2022, Mr. Isakson, Paul Cullen, the Company\u2019s Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, and Gavriel Kahane, the chief executive\nofficer of Arkhouse, met by videoconference to discuss Arkhouse\u2019s intentions with respect to the Company. During the conversation, Mr. Kahane\nnoted that he believed that the Company was too small, had too much preferred stock and debt, should consider selling its grocery-anchored retail\nassets and use the proceeds to redeem outstanding preferred stock, and should broaden its public disclosure. Mr. Kahane acknowledged that the\nCompany had already made substantial progress on several of these initiatives. Mr. Kahane stated that if ongoing conversations with the Company\nwere constructive that Arkhouse may withdraw its board nominations.\nOn January 30, 2022, Blackstone entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which contained a customary \u201cstandstill\u201d provision\nthat prevented Blackstone from, among other things, making a proposal with respect to an acquisition of the Company except on a confidential\nbasis to the Company. Thereafter, on January 31, 2022, we opened a virtual data room and thereafter Blackstone engaged in due diligence.\nThroughout January and until the merger agreement was signed, representatives of Goldman Sachs had multiple discussions with representatives\nof Blackstone regarding its due diligence review of the Company and its business.\nOn February 2, 2022, Mr. Cullen emailed Mr. Kahane to schedule a meeting on February 15, 2022 between Messrs. Murphy, Isakson, Cullen and\nKahane to follow up on the matters discussed on January 26, 2022\u037e however, the Company requested to reschedule the meeting on February 14,\n2022 due to some personal conflicts that arose shortly before the meeting.\nOn February 6, 2022, Mr. Werner notified a representative of Goldman Sachs that Blackstone intended to provide a proposal later that week or early\nthe following week. Also during the week of February 7, 2022, following a request by Blackstone, Blackstone conducted site visits.\nOn February 8, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs received telephonic inquiries from a large private investment firm primarily focused on\nglobal real estate (\u201cParty A\u201d) and a publicly traded REIT that owns multifamily communities (\u201cParty B\u201d). Each of those inquiries indicated a general\ninterest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company, but did not include any specific terms. Goldman Sachs notified our management and\noutside counsel of these inquiries shortly thereafter, and Mr. Murphy subsequently informed Mr. McLure. The Company determined not to\nrespond to these inquiries until our board of directors had an opportunity to consider them and the Company\u2019s response.\nOn February 9, 2022, representatives of Blackstone, our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs participated in a due diligence\ncall.\nOn February 9, 2022, after the close of trading on the NYSE, Bloomberg News published an article reporting that the Company was exploring\noptions including a full or partial sale after receiving inbound interest from potential acquirors (the \u201cBloomberg Article\u201d). On February 9, 2022, the\nclosing price of our common stock was $17.96 per share.\nLater in the day on February 9, 2022, a representative of the Company received an email from a representative of Party A indicating an interest in\nany strategic alternatives that the Company might be exploring. Party A did not provide any specific terms of a potential transaction. Mr. Murphy\nnotified Mr. McLure of the email from Party A. The Company determined not to respond to this email until our board of directors had an\nopportunity to consider the recent inquiries and the Company\u2019s response.\nOn February 10, 2022, representatives of Blackstone called representatives of Goldman Sachs and indicated that Blackstone had substantially\ncompleted its business due diligence and would like to acquire the Company at a proposed purchase price of $23.50 per share of common stock in\ncash (representing an approximate 31% premium\n34\nto the $17.96 per share unaffected closing price of our common stock on February 9, 2022, the date of the Bloomberg Article, and a 36% premium to\nthe trailing 30-day volume weighted average trading price (or VWAP) through such date). The proposal assumed that the Company would declare\nonly one additional quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share of common stock prior to closing. Mr. Werner noted that Blackstone had received all\nnecessary internal approvals to make its proposal, would proceed without any financing contingency and was prepared to move quickly to\ncomplete its confirmatory due diligence and negotiate and finalize a merger agreement as soon as February 14, 2022.\nMr. Werner indicated that Blackstone\u2019s proposal assumed there would not be a pre-signing market check. He offered the Company a go-shop\nprovision, which would permit the Company to solicit alternative proposals during the 30-day period following the signing of a merger agreement.\nThe go-shop would be paired with a lower termination fee (equal to 1.7% of the value of our common and preferred stock (approximately $52\nmillion)) payable if we terminated the merger agreement to enter into a superior transaction with a party making a proposal during the go-shop\nperiod and a higher termination fee (equal to 3.25% of the value of our common and preferred stock (approximately $100 million)) thereafter, along\nwith matching rights if any superior proposal were received. Blackstone\u2019s proposal also contemplated a reverse termination fee of 9% of the value\nof our common and preferred stock (approximately $275 million) payable by Blackstone in certain circumstances as an exclusive remedy with no\nright for the Company to obtain specific performance. In order to move expeditiously given the Bloomberg Article, Mr. Werner conveyed that\nBlackstone was prepared to use the fully negotiated agreement from Blackstone\u2019s recently announced acquisition of Resource as a precedent\nagreement for the proposed transaction with the Company. The representative of Goldman Sachs informed Mr. Werner that the Company would\nrevert after discussing the proposal with our board of directors.\nAlso on February 10, 2022, Mr. Murphy received a text message from a representative of a publicly traded REIT that owns multifamily communities\n(\u201cParty C\u201d) indicating that Party C would be interested in learning more from the Company. No specific terms were provided. Mr. Murphy\nsubsequently briefed Mr. McLure regarding both Blackstone\u2019s indication of interest and the communication from Party C. The Company determined\nnot to respond to the text message from Party C until our board of directors had an opportunity to consider the recent inquiries and the Company\u2019s\nresponse.\nOn February 11, 2022, our board of directors was provided a letter from Goldman Sachs with respect to certain relationships with Blackstone, which\nwe refer to as the \u201cGoldman Sachs Disclosure Letter\u201d.\nOn February 12, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E\nand K&S in attendance. During the meeting, representatives of V&E reviewed the directors\u2019 duties under Maryland law in connection with a\npotential acquisition of the Company, and our board of directors received an update from representatives of Goldman Sachs on the discussions\nwith Blackstone since the last meeting of our board of directors on January 21, 2022 and the inquiries from Party A, Party B and Party C.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and K&S described the terms of Blackstone\u2019s proposal. Our management team also reviewed with our board of\ndirectors the financial projections. Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with our board of directors their preliminary financial analysis of\nthe Company, as well as Goldman Sachs\u2019 review of strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including remaining as an\nindependent public company or selling certain or all of our grocery-anchored retail assets. A discussion ensued among the directors, management,\nour outside counsel and financial advisor regarding, among other things: risks and considerations related to each of the strategic alternatives\u037e\nopportunities to grow our business, improve leverage and become more profitable\u037e challenges that we face and that could arise in the future\u037e the\ncost of obtaining capital\u037e reasons why Blackstone might be able to realize more value from the business than another bidder and thereby pay a\nhigher price to acquire the Company, including Blackstone\u2019s low cost of capital, substantial available capital and interest in multifamily properties\nlocated in the Sunbelt region\u037e and amount of capital needed to acquire all of our common and preferred stock for cash.\nOur board of directors discussed with management and our advisors the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were to be\nsold, including whether a competitive bidding process would yield a higher price than Blackstone\u2019s proposal with a go-shop provision, as well as\nbenefits and risks to the Company and its business posed by engaging with Party A, Party B or Party C or contacting other potential bidders before\nannouncing any transaction, including the risk that engaging with or contacting other potential bidders prior to signing a definitive agreement with\nBlackstone could jeopardize the availability of Blackstone\u2019s proposal. Our board of directors also discussed with its advisors the benefits of a \u201cgo-\nshop\u201d provision that would permit the Company to\n35\nentertain potentially superior proposals from other bidders while having a binding contract with Blackstone in the event that a merger agreement\nwas ultimately executed with Blackstone and the impact that the reduced company termination fee during the go-shop period proposed by\nBlackstone might have on other interested parties and their willingness to submit a superior proposal. Our board of directors also discussed with\nmanagement and our advisors other potential risks and considerations that included: the limited universe of potential third parties with the financial\nability to acquire the Company in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common and preferred stock without obtaining financing\nfrom third parties\u037e concerns about the recent media reports and rumors that the Company was exploring a possible partial or full sale of the\ncompany disrupting our business relationships and risking employee turnover\u037e and indicative capitalization rates from recent transactions in the\nREIT industry. The directors unanimously agreed that the transaction process should be expedited to minimize risks to the Company, protect its\nbusiness and maximize stockholder value and determined to further discuss next steps the following day.\nOn February 13, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E\nand K&S in attendance. The directors discussed strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company other than a sale of the Company,\nincluding a sale of its grocery-anchored retail assets and remaining an independent public company, and risks and considerations related to each.\nOur board of directors concluded that it was not in the best interests of the Company or our stockholders to pursue any of the strategic alternatives\nother than continuing to consider the Blackstone proposal or remaining an independent public company. Our board of directors next discussed\nwith management and our advisors, among other items, the Company\u2019s financial projections, the Company\u2019s recent share price and the premia of\nthe Blackstone proposal to various Company common stock prices, as further described in the section entitled \u201c-Opinion of Our Financial Advisor-\nSummary of Financial Analyses\u201d, FFO trading multiples of comparable multifamily and retail public REITs, potential future Company common stock\nprices based on these multiples and the financial projections, the present value of potential future stock prices and dividends compared to the\nBlackstone proposal, including how different assumptions affected such potential future Company common stock prices and the present value of\npotential future stock prices and dividends, and other financial matters related to the Company. Our board of directors also discussed with its\nadvisors an illustrative timeline if it were to proceed with further discussions with Blackstone. After discussing the terms of Blackstone\u2019s proposal\nand various potential responses, our board of directors unanimously agreed that it was in the best interests of the Company to continue\ndiscussions with Blackstone.\nOur board of directors then discussed the best process for maximizing stockholder value if the Company were to be sold, including whether to first\nsolicit additional potential bidders or sign a merger agreement with Blackstone that included a go-shop provision. Our board of directors further\ndiscussed the benefits of a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that would permit the Company to entertain potentially superior proposals from other bidders in an\norderly process while having a binding contract with Blackstone and determined that a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision could be beneficial so long as the\ntermination fee during the go-shop period was sufficiently low so as not to deter other bidders. Our board of directors also noted that Party A,\nParty B and Party C had not indicated that they had done any work analyzing a transaction at that point, and on the other hand, Blackstone had\ncompleted its due diligence and was prepared to sign a merger agreement within the next few days if the parties could agree to terms of the\ntransaction. Our board of directors discussed with our advisors the likelihood of Party A, Party B and Party C submitting a proposal with better\nterms than the terms of Blackstone\u2019s proposal, timing considerations relating to such possible proposals and the terms thereof including the\npotential form of consideration and the likelihood of a financing contingency. The directors also discussed that engaging with Party A, Party B or\nParty C, or soliciting additional potential bidders, could result in Blackstone changing the terms in its proposal or electing to disengage from\nnegotiations for a potential transaction in light of Blackstone\u2019s stated unwillingness to participate in a pre-signing market check. Our board of\ndirectors unanimously agreed that it would not be in the best interests of the Company to pause discussions with Blackstone to allow time to\nengage with Party A, Party B or Party C or solicit additional potential bidders so long as any potential deal with Blackstone included a post-signing\ngo-shop with a low termination fee. As a result, our board of directors determined that Mr. Murphy and representatives of the Company should not\ncontact Party A, Party B or Party C until the Company had entered into a binding merger agreement with Blackstone containing a go-shop\nprovision and low termination fees.\nFollowing further discussion, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue to\nengage in discussions with Blackstone and directed a representative of Goldman Sachs to present Blackstone with a counterproposal on the\nfollowing terms: a purchase price of $25.00 per share of common stock in cash (representing an approximate 39% premium to the $17.96 per share\nunaffected closing price of our common stock on February 9, 2022, the date of the Bloomberg Article, and an approximate 41% premium to\n36\nthe trailing 30-day VWAP through such date)\u037e the Company would have the right to declare only one additional quarterly dividend of $0.175 per\nshare of the common stock prior to closing of the transaction\u037e a 30-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision with a two-tier termination fee consisting of a\ntermination fee of $25 million (equal to 0.5% of the Company\u2019s enterprise value) if the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a\nsuperior proposal in connection with the go-shop and a termination fee of $50 million (equal to 0.9% of the Company\u2019s enterprise value) thereafter\u037e\nand a reverse termination fee of $300 million equal to 5.4% of the Company\u2019s enterprise value) payable by Blackstone in certain circumstances as an\nexclusive remedy and no right for the Company to obtain specific performance. Given the recent media reports and market rumors that the Company\nwas exploring a possible partial or full sale of the company, the directors continued to be of the view that expediting the transaction process would\nbe critical to minimizing risks to the Company and protecting its business and maximizing stockholder value.\nMr. McLure, as our lead independent director, noted that our board of directors needed to understand Blackstone\u2019s thoughts about retaining the\nCompany platform and employees in connection with finalizing a transaction, assuming that the Company and Blackstone could agree to the price\nand other material terms of the transaction. The directors unanimously agreed that, if the transaction progressed, Mr. McLure should discuss\nBlackstone\u2019s intentions. The directors and a representative of V&E also discussed options to handle future negotiations with Blackstone given the\npace of the transaction. Our board of directors also discussed the interests of our directors and executive officers in the mergers that are different\nfrom, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally, as discussed under \u201c-Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d.\nFollowing this discussion, our board of directors formed a committee of directors consisting of Mr. Murphy as well as independent directors Mr.\nMcLure, John Cannon, Sara Finley and Tim Peterson (the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d) in order to expeditiously evaluate and handle future\nnegotiations with Blackstone.\nDuring this February 13, 2022 meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs described its qualifications and experience with these types of\ntransactions. Following the departure of the Goldman Sachs representatives from the meeting, our board of directors discussed with management\nand representatives of V&E and K&S the contemplated engagement of Goldman Sachs as our financial advisor, Goldman Sachs\u2019 relationships with\nBlackstone and the fees to be paid to Goldman Sachs in connection with their engagement. After considering the overall reputation, experience and\nqualifications of Goldman Sachs, as well as Goldman Sachs\u2019 knowledge of multifamily and retail property asset classes and broader real estate\nmarket and the Company\u2019s business and properties in particular, and information provided by Goldman Sachs in the Goldman Sachs Disclosure\nLetter as discussed under \u201c- Opinions of Our Financial Advisors,\u201d our board of directors unanimously approved the engagement of Goldman Sachs\nas our financial advisor with respect to a potential sale of the Company and authorized management and our outside counsel to finalize the\nengagement letter with Goldman Sachs.\nOn February 13, 2022, as directed by our board of directors, representatives of Goldman Sachs orally communicated to representatives of\nBlackstone our counterproposal.\nLater that day, Blackstone\u2019s outside counsel, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (\u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d), sent to our outside counsel, K&S and V&E,\ndrafts of a merger agreement, limited guaranty and equity commitment letter. The draft merger agreement contemplated that, among other things: the\nCompany would merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Blackstone and another wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of\nBlackstone would merge with and into the Partnership, with the respective holders of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and units in the\nPartnership to receive the same cash consideration\u037e the Company would be able to solicit proposals during a 30-day go-shop period with the ability\nto continue to negotiate during the subsequent 10-day period with a bidder who made a qualified proposal during the go-shop period\u037e and, subject\nto certain exceptions, the Company would be permitted flexibility to continue to operate in the ordinary course of business prior to closing.\nBetween February 13, 2022 and February 15, 2022, we, with the assistance of K&S and V&E, and Blackstone, with the assistance of Simpson\nThacher, negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related documentation. The negotiations covered various aspects of the transaction,\nincluding, among other things: the treatment the preferred stock and warrants, the representations and warranties to be made by the parties, the\nrestriction on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business until completion of the transaction, the conditions to completion of the mergers, our ability to\nparticipate in discussions and negotiations with third parties relating to unsolicited proposals, the right of our board of directors to change its\nrecommendation that stockholders approve the merger in response to a superior proposal or otherwise, our right to terminate the merger agreement\nto accept a superior proposal under certain conditions, the other termination provisions and the triggers of the termination fee payable by us, and\nthe\n37\nprovisions regarding our equity awards, employee benefit plans, retention, severance and other compensation matters. Blackstone also continued\nto complete its confirmatory due diligence.\nOn February 14, 2022, Mr. Werner orally communicated a revised proposal to a representative of Goldman Sachs. Blackstone accepted the\nCompany\u2019s February 13, 2022 proposal, except that the termination fee payable by the Company would be $100 million (rather than $50 million as the\nCompany had proposed) if the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal after the 30-day go-shop period (or the\nsubsequent 10-day period to enter into a superior proposal with a bidder who made a qualified proposal during the go-shop period). Blackstone\nalso reiterated that it expected the parties to work expeditiously and expressed its desire to sign a merger agreement by 8:00 a.m. on February 16,\n2022.\nLater in the day on February 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and K&S. A representative of\nGoldman Sachs reviewed Blackstone\u2019s proposal with the Transaction Committee, noting that Blackstone assumed that the Company would not\ncontact other parties prior to signing a merger agreement with Blackstone. The Transaction Committee discussed the terms of Blackstone\u2019s latest\nproposal and unanimously agreed to respond by requesting a lower termination fee of $80 million (rather than Blackstone\u2019s proposed $100 million)\npayable by the Company if the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal after the expiration of the 30-day go-shop\nperiod (or the subsequent 10-day period to enter into a superior proposal with a bidder who made a qualified proposal during the go-shop period).\nFollowing the meeting, at the direction of the Transaction Committee, a representative of Goldman Sachs orally communicated our counterproposal\nto Blackstone, which Blackstone accepted. With the parties having agreed upon the purchase price and the other material terms of the proposed\ntransaction, Mr. McLure and Ms. Finley discussed with Mr. Werner Blackstone\u2019s general thoughts on the Company\u2019s platform and employees.\nDuring this discussion, Mr. Werner articulated that Blackstone was impressed by the Company\u2019s platform, including the Company\u2019s people and\nprocesses, and that the platform was an important consideration in determining to acquire the Company. No specific employees or employment\nterms were discussed.\nLater on February 14, 2022, a representative of Party A sent an email to Goldman Sachs indicating an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of\nthe Company without specifying any terms. Goldman Sachs notified our management and outside counsel of this inquiry shortly thereafter and Mr.\nMurphy informed Mr. McLure of this inquiry that same day. The Company determined to not respond to this email until our board of directors had\nan opportunity to consider this inquiry and the Company\u2019s response.\nOn February 15, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E\nand K&S in attendance. Mr. McLure and Ms. Finley updated our board of directors regarding their discussion with Blackstone the prior day. A\nrepresentative of Goldman Sachs updated our board of directors on the changes to the key economic terms in Blackstone\u2019s proposal since the last\nboard of directors meeting and also informed our board of directors about Party A\u2019s inquiry. Our board of directors asked questions and engaged in\ndiscussion. A representative of Goldman Sachs presented to our board of directors Goldman Sachs\u2019 preliminary financial analysis of the common\nstock consideration. A representative of K&S provided a summary of the merger agreement and other transaction documentation and noted that\nthey were substantially complete, and representatives of K&S and V&E noted that it would be possible to sign the merger agreement before the\nmarket opened on February 16, 2022.\nAround 10:30 p.m. on February 15, 2022, Party A sent the Company an unsolicited letter that contained a non-binding proposal from Party A\nrelating to a potential acquisition of the Company by Party A for $29.25 per share of Company common stock, without specifying any additional\nterms. The letter stated that Party A was ready to confirm its price within five calendar days of receipt of non-public property level and corporate\ninformation, and after economic terms were agreed, it would need an unspecified period to complete confirmatory due diligence. While the letter\nstated that the proposal was not contingent on financing, it indicated that a portion of the funds for the transaction may be provided by an\nopportunity fund sponsored by Party A. The letter said that Party A was fully authorized to pursue the transaction on the terms of the proposal,\nbut added that it anticipated obtaining final approval from its investment committee upon completion of confirmatory diligence and agreement with\nthe Company on the material transaction terms.\nLater that evening, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with representatives of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs,\nV&E and K&S to discuss the proposal from Party A. The group reviewed and\n38\ndiscussed the potential benefits, risks and other considerations involved in engaging with Party A and potentially other parties prior to entering\ninto a merger agreement with Blackstone, including those discussed at prior meetings of our board of directors, recent geopolitical risks, related\nmarket volatility, that Blackstone had completed all of its due diligence, Blackstone and the Company had agreed upon all financial and other\nmaterial terms of a transaction and were imminently prepared to execute the merger agreement, and that engaging with Party A or other potential\nbidders could jeopardize the availability of Blackstone\u2019s proposal in light of its stated unwillingness to participate in a pre-signing market check.\nThe Transaction Committee also considered that, if viable, Party A\u2019s proposal exceeded the price per share of the Blackstone transaction, but that\nParty A\u2019s letter was only a non-binding indication of interest, that Party A had not yet conducted any non-public due diligence on the Company,\nthat Party A indicated it would need five days to confirm its price after it received non-public property level and corporate information and then an\nunspecified period for confirmatory due diligence, that Party A\u2019s offer was subject to and could be altered upon completion of due diligence, and\nthat it anticipated obtaining final approval from its investment committee upon completion of confirmatory diligence and agreement with the\nCompany on the material transaction terms. The Transaction Committee also discussed that at least a portion of the proceeds associated with the\nParty A proposal may be sourced from an opportunity fund sponsored by Party A, indicating a higher cost of capital and, as a consequence, that\nParty A could reduce its price.\nThe Transaction Committee also discussed with our advisors the potential opportunity for the Company to continue soliciting a superior proposal\nfrom Party A and other interested parties following the signing of a merger agreement with Blackstone pursuant to the go-shop mechanism. The\nTransaction Committee believed that the go-shop process would provide Party A and other interested parties the opportunity to conduct due\ndiligence on the Company and make a binding proposal if Party A or any other party desired to do so. In particular, the Transaction Committee\nobserved that the $25 million company termination fee applicable to qualified proposals made during the go-shop period, which represented\napproximately $0.42 per share of common stock on a fully-diluted basis as of February 16, 2022, was low compared to the size of the proposed\ntransaction with Blackstone, the indication of interest from Party A, and similar transactions involving other public companies, and not likely to\npreclude or discourage Party A or other interested parties from submitting a superior proposal. The group also discussed the ability for the\nCompany to maintain control through a go-shop process that would allow a market check to maximize shareholder value, the limited universe of\npotential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common and\npreferred stock with no financing contingency and concerns about the recent market leak and rumors that the Company was exploring strategic\nalternatives including a possible partial or full sale disrupting the Company\u2019s business relationships and risking employee turnover. Following\ndiscussion, after considering the certainty represented by Blackstone\u2019s $25.00 per share fully financed proposal, the risk that Blackstone could\nwithdraw or adversely modify its proposal, the fact that Party A may not make a definitive proposal and our directors\u2019 belief that Party A and others\nwould have the opportunity to engage with the Company during the go-shop period to pursue a competing transaction, the Transaction Committee\nunanimously recommended that our board of directors approve the merger agreement with Blackstone and encourage Party A to participate in the\ngo-shop process. As a result of this discussion, the Transaction Committee determined that Mr. Murphy and representatives of the Company\nshould not reach out to Party A until following the start of the go-shop period.\nOn February 16, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting with members of our management team and representatives from Goldman Sachs, V&E\nand K&S in attendance. Mr. Murphy and a representative of Goldman Sachs reviewed the non-binding proposal received from Party A and Mr.\nMcLure noted that the Transaction Committee had met the night before and unanimously recommended that our board of directors approve the\nmerger agreement with Blackstone and advise Party A to participate in the go-shop process. Our board of directors discussed with representatives\nof K&S and V&E the process for Party A to participate in the go-shop process and the considerations discussed by the Transaction Committee.\nRepresentatives of our management, Goldman Sachs and K&S then updated our board of directors on changes to the merger agreement since the\nlast board of directors meeting and noted that the merger agreement and other transaction documentation were ready to be signed. A representative\nof V&E then reminded the members of our board of directors of their duties under Maryland law. A representative of V&E described a proposed\namendment to our bylaws that would make specified state and federal courts in Maryland the sole and exclusive forum for litigation relating to our\ninternal affairs, including stockholder derivative suits and alleged breaches of duties owed to stockholders, and the federal district courts in the\nUnited States the sole and exclusive forum for litigation arising under the Securities Act. Following this discussion, a representative of Goldman\nSachs presented to our board of directors the Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analysis of the common stock consideration and rendered to our board of\ndirectors Goldman Sachs\u2019 oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of such date,\nand based upon and\n39\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the\nholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,\nto such holders. A representative of V&E then reviewed the proposed resolutions prepared for the proposed transaction, including the engagement\nof KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. as an additional financial advisor to the Company. Following these presentations and discussions, and other\ndiscussions by our board of directors concerning, among other things, the matters described below under \u201c-Reasons for the Mergers,\u201d including\nour board of directors\u2019 belief that the mergers are more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic transactions available to the Company,\nincluding remaining as an independent public company, our board of directors unanimously determined the mergers advisable, approved the\nmergers on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and resolved to recommend the approval of the mergers by our stockholders.\nFollowing the board of directors\u2019 meeting, we contacted representatives of Blackstone to advise them that our board of directors had unanimously\napproved the proposed transaction.\nDuring the early morning on February 16, 2022, the Company, affiliates of Blackstone and the other parties thereto executed and delivered the\nmerger agreement. The Company issued a press release publicly announcing the mergers and execution of the merger agreement before the opening\nof the market on February 16, 2022. The press release announcing the transaction also noted that the merger agreement included a 30-day \u201cgo-\nshop\u201d period that would expire on March 18, 2022.\nLater in the day on February 16, 2022, at the direction of our board of directors, representatives of Goldman Sachs began contacting Party A, Party\nB, Party C and other potential counterparties that might consider entering into an alternative transaction with the Company. In addition, on\nFebruary 17, 2022, Mr. Murphy sent an e-mail to Party A acknowledging its non-binding proposal from February 15, 2022, notifying it that the\nCompany had begun its go-shop process pursuant to the merger agreement and welcoming Party A\u2019s participation in the process. During the go-\nshop period, Goldman Sachs contacted 23 potential counterparties (including Party A, Party B and Party C), consisting of five strategic parties and\n18 financial sponsor parties, and received inbound inquiries from two additional potential counterparties (one strategic and one financial). Of these\n25 parties, nine, including Party A, Party B and Party C, entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company. Each of the parties that entered\ninto a confidentiality agreement received access to the virtual data room containing non-public information about the Company. Other than the\nproposal submitted by Party A on February 15, 2022, none of these parties submitted a proposal to acquire the Company.\nParty A entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company on February 22, 2022 and received access to the virtual data room on such date.\nOn March 4, 2022, representatives of Party A attended a due diligence call with Mr. Murphy, other members of our management and representatives\nof Goldman Sachs. Later that same day, members of our management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and K&S attended a legal due diligence\ncall with representatives of Party A and its outside counsel.\nOn March 15, 2022, a representative of Party A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that Party A intended to submit a comprehensive bid\npackage to the Company that would specify the economic terms of Party A\u2019s offer and include definitive transaction documents, including debt\ncommitment letters. On that same day, representatives of Party A\u2019s outside counsel contacted K&S and conveyed the same message, and\nsubsequently sent K&S a draft of Party A\u2019s proposed merger agreement, equity commitment letter and limited guaranty. Party A\u2019s proposed merger\nagreement did not specify the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock and contemplated that the transaction would be\nfinanced through a combination of equity financing from an investment vehicle sponsored by Party A and debt financing from third party lenders in\nthe form of senior secured bridge term loans and mortgage and mezzanine loans on terms that would be set forth in debt commitment letters. Party A\ndid not provide debt commitment letters or otherwise describe the amount or terms of it proposed debt financing or identify the lenders who would\nprovide the debt. Party A\u2019s proposed equity commitment letter did not specify a commitment amount and funding of the equity was conditioned\nupon the receipt of debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letters.\nOn March 16, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs had a call with representatives of Party A during which the Party A representatives indicated\nthat they were aware of the upcoming expiration of the go-shop period on\n40\nMarch 18, 2022 and indicated that they expected to touch base with Goldman Sachs on March 17, 2022 to provide an update on Party A\u2019s internal\napproval process, but that a formal offer would likely not be submitted until March 18, 2022. Representatives of Goldman Sachs notified the\nCompany of these discussions, and the Company scheduled a board meeting for March 18, 2022 to discuss any offer that may be received from\nParty A and any other developments that may occur. Later on March 16, 2022, K&S, on behalf of the Company, sent comments on Party A\u2019s\nproposed merger agreement, equity commitment letter and limited guaranty to Party A\u2019s outside counsel.\nAt 12:00 p.m. on March 17, 2022, Party A\u2019s outside counsel met with members of our management and representatives of K&S to discuss\noutstanding due diligence matters. Later that day, representatives of Party A contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss Party A\u2019s\nproposed sources of capital for the transaction. The representatives of Party A noted that the size and terms of Party A\u2019s contemplated senior\nsecured bridge term loans would result in unfavorable potential investment returns to Party A in a transaction. In order to mitigate this issue, the\nrepresentatives of Party A noted that Party A would need to enter into an \u201cequity bridge\u201d instrument which would incrementally reduce the size of\nthe bridge term loans if and to the extent that an investment vehicle affiliated with Party A\u2019s sponsor received equity capital from third-party\ninvestors that was allocated to the transaction. In response to a question from representatives of Goldman Sachs on whether Party A could avoid\nthis issue by instead using additional sources of available equity capital, the representatives of Party A explained that investment vehicles affiliated\nwith Party A\u2019s sponsor did not have sufficient committed capital at such time.\nA few hours later, representatives of Party A notified representatives of Goldman Sachs that Party A would not be submitting a proposal. The Party\nA representatives noted that, although Party A wished to submit a proposal, it was not able to obtain the necessary financing on terms that would\npermit it to pay more than the $25.00 per share of common stock under the Blackstone merger agreement. The representatives of Party A explained\nthat given the recent deterioration in the debt and financial markets, and the fact that spreads on mortgage and mezzanine loans had widened\nsignificantly since it had submitted its non-binding proposal, Party A could not obtain sufficient financing on terms that would allow it to pay more\nthan $25.00 per share. Representatives of Goldman Sachs promptly informed Mr. Murphy and the Company of this communication. The Company\ndecided to hold the board meeting scheduled for March 18, 2022 to provide an opportunity for our board of directors to discuss any other\ndevelopments that may occur prior to the expiry of the go-shop period.\nOn March 18, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting, with members of our management team and representatives of Goldman Sachs, V&E and\nK&S in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of the go-shop process undertaken, including the broad solicitation\nof various strategic parties and financial sponsors, and the recent discussions with Party A.\nThe Company issued a press release and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K prior to the market open on March 21, 2022, announcing that the go-\nshop period expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 18, 2022.\nReasons for the Mergers\nIn reaching its unanimous decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be\nadvisable and in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests and to approve the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the\nconsummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of common stock approve the merger\nproposal, the board of directors consulted with our senior management team, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number\nof factors, including the following material factors which the board of directors viewed as supporting its decision:\n\u2022the current and historical trading prices of shares of our common stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $25.00 per share in cash\nrepresents a premium of approximately 39% to the unaffected closing price of $17.96 on February 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to the Bloomberg\narticle reporting that the Company was exploring options including a full or partial sale after receiving inbound interest, and a premium of\napproximately 60% to the 90-day volume-weighted average price through that date\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations and that the merger consideration of $25.00 per share exceeded\nBlackstone\u2019s initial anticipated range as of December 7, 2021 of $4 to $5 per share above our common stock\u2019s market price (implying an anticipated\nrange of $17.56 to $18.56 per share based on the closing price of $13.56 per share on December 6, 2021)\u037e\n41"

mergers, to be\nadvisable and in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests and to approve the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the\nconsummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend that the holders of common stock approve the merger\nproposal, the board of directors consulted with our senior management team, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number\nof factors, including the following material factors which the board of directors viewed as supporting its decision:\n\u2022the current and historical trading prices of shares of our common stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $25.00 per share in cash\nrepresents a premium of approximately 39% to the unaffected closing price of $17.96 on February 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to the Bloomberg\narticle reporting that the Company was exploring options including a full or partial sale after receiving inbound interest, and a premium of\napproximately 60% to the 90-day volume-weighted average price through that date\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations and that the merger consideration of $25.00 per share exceeded\nBlackstone\u2019s initial anticipated range as of December 7, 2021 of $4 to $5 per share above our common stock\u2019s market price (implying an anticipated\nrange of $17.56 to $18.56 per share based on the closing price of $13.56 per share on December 6, 2021)\u037e\n41\n\u2022our board of directors\u2019 belief that, in light of Blackstone\u2019s low cost of capital, substantial available capital and interest in multifamily properties\nlocated in the Sunbelt region, Blackstone was the possible acquiror likely to offer the highest price for the Company\u037e\n\u2022our board of directors\u2019 belief that there exists a limited universe of potential third parties with the financial ability to acquire the Company without\nobtaining financing from third parties in light of the amount of cash required to acquire all of our common and preferred stock\u037e and that the large\namount of our preferred stock and debt could negatively impact the price for our common stock that bidders may be able to pay\u037e\n\u2022our board of directors\u2019 belief that contacting other potential bidders before announcing a transaction with Blackstone given these circumstances\nwould result in significant risks to the Company and its business, including concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction\nwould disrupt our business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price\nvolatility\u037e\n\u2022our board of directors\u2019 belief, in light of Blackstone\u2019s stated unwillingness to participate in a pre-signing market check, that engaging with Party A\nwould delay and jeopardize a transaction with Blackstone that was imminently ready to be entered into at the time of receipt of Party A\u2019s proposal,\ntaking into account the fact that Party A\u2019s proposal was non-binding, that Party A had not yet conducted any non-public due diligence on the\nCompany, that Party A indicated it would need five days to confirm its price after it received non-public property level and corporate information\nand then an unspecified period for confirmatory due diligence, that Party A\u2019s offer was subject to and could be altered upon completion of due\ndiligence, that it anticipated obtaining final approval from its investment committee upon completion of confirmatory diligence and agreement with\nthe Company on the material transaction terms, and that at least a portion of the proceeds associated with Party A\u2019s proposal may be sourced from\nan opportunity fund sponsored by Party A, indicating a higher cost of capital and a risk that Party A could reduce its price\u037e\n\u2022the Company\u2019s right under the merger agreement, during the 30-day go-shop period, to actively solicit other proposals from, furnish information to\nand conduct negotiations with, third parties (including Party A) providing an opportunity to determine if a third party is willing to pay a higher\nvalue per share than Blackstone\u037e\n\u2022our right to terminate the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the\nimplementation of a superior proposal, upon payment of the company termination payment\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the lower company termination payment of $25 million during the go-shop period, which represented approximately $0.42 per share of\ncommon stock on a fully-diluted basis as of February 16, 2022 and approximately 0.5% of the Company\u2019s enterprise value, and the company\ntermination payment of $80 million following the go-shop period (representing approximately 1.4% of the Company\u2019s enterprise value) were viewed\nby our board of directors, after consultation with our outside legal counsel and financial advisors, as reasonable under the circumstances, low\ncompared to the size of the proposed transaction with Blackstone, the indication of interest from Party A, and similar transactions involving public\ncompanies, and not likely to preclude or discourage Party A or other interested parties from making a superior proposal\u037e\n\u2022our right after the go-shop period, in certain circumstances in response to unsolicited competing proposals, to furnish information to and conduct\nnegotiations with third parties\u037e\n\u2022the right of our board of directors under the merger agreement to change, withhold, qualify or withdraw its recommendation that the holders of\ncommon stock approve the merger under certain circumstances, subject to payment of the company termination payment if Parent elects to\nterminate the merger agreement in such circumstances\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the\nclosing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent or greater value from our\nbusiness plan for our properties or other possible strategic alternatives (including the sale of our grocery-anchored real estate assets)\u037e\n42\n\u2022the knowledge of our board of directors of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of the Company, including its\nmultifamily and grocery-anchored retail assets, as well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which the Company and\neach of its businesses operate, including economic, market and capital raising conditions\u037e\n\u2022the accumulation of available equity capital for stabilized multifamily residential real estate assets resulting in low capitalization rates for those\nassets, with prices for multifamily residential real estate assets being at or near historical highs, strong revenue fundamentals in the multifamily\nresidential real estate market in the Sunbelt region, increasing supply of multifamily residential real estate assets, as well as the possibility of\ninterest rate increases in the future, which our board of directors and management believed made for opportune conditions for a sale transaction\u037e\n\u2022the risks and uncertainties of remaining a public company owner of our multifamily residential real estate portfolio and/or selling certain of our\ngrocery-anchored retail assets, including the substantial amount of our preferred stock and debt, including significant property level debt, the need\nto frequently raise capital due to the capital-intensive nature of the Company\u2019s business, the difficulty and cost of obtaining such capital, and the\nchallenges of acquiring multifamily properties on an accretive basis in the current environment\u037e\n\u2022the belief that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic alternatives\navailable to the Company, including after considering the feasibility of such alternatives and the significant risks and uncertainties associated with\npursuing such alternatives, including remaining as an independent public company or selling certain or all of our grocery-anchored retail assets\u037e\n\u2022the expected probability that the mergers would be completed based on, among other things, Blackstone\u2019s substantial available capital, proven\nability to complete large acquisition transactions, extensive experience in the real estate industry, the absence of a financing condition and the $300\nmillion parent termination payment payable to the Company if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances (representing\napproximately 5.4% of the Company\u2019s enterprise value), which payment is guaranteed by BREIT Operating Partnership L.P.\u037e\n\u2022the financial analysis of Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed with our board of directors, and the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently\nconfirmed in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion dated as of February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and\nbased upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock\nto be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a\nfinancial point of view to such holders, as more fully described below in the section \u201c-Opinion of Our Financial Advisor\u201d\u037e\n\u2022the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by the board of directors with our financial and legal advisors, and the fact\nthat such terms were the product of arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the parties\u037e and\n\u2022the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and our stockholders would be free to reject the merger by voting\nagainst the merger for any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the stockholders\u2019 meeting (in certain cases subject to payment\nby the Company of an $80 million company termination payment if the Company subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement relating to,\nor to consummate, a competing proposal).\nThe board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger agreement and the merger:\n\u2022our inability, after 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 18, 2022, to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the company\ntermination payment payable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential\nbidders, including Party A, from making a competing bid to acquire us\u037e\n43\n\u2022the fact that, following the mergers, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders will not\nparticipate in any future earnings or growth\u037e\n\u2022the risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to our stockholders than the proposed\nmerger with Blackstone\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the mergers might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions to the closing of the mergers,\nincluding the risk that our stockholders do not approve the merger proposal\u037e\n\u2022the fact that if either of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or Merger Sub III fails, or threatens to fail, to satisfy its obligations under the merger\nagreement, we are not entitled to specifically enforce the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter, and that our exclusive remedy, available\nif the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, would be limited to the parent termination payment in the amount of $300 million (the\npayment of which is guaranteed by BREIT Operating Partnership L.P.)\u037e\n\u2022the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the mergers, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking business\nopportunities that may arise pending completion of the mergers\u037e\n\u2022the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company is not permitted to make, declare or pay regular quarterly cash dividends on\ncommon stock for fiscal quarters after the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the receipt of the cash consideration in the merger would be taxable to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u2022the fact that, under Maryland law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or similar rights of an objecting\nstockholder in connection with the merger\u037e\n\u2022the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and completing the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement and the substantial time and effort of management required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and\nrelated disruptions to the operation of our business\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the failure to complete the mergers,\nand/or actions that the Company may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to take under the merger agreement could have an adverse impact on\nour existing and prospective business relationships with tenants and other third parties and on our employees\u037e and\n\u2022the fact that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, our stockholders\ngenerally (see \u201c- Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d).\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material\nfactors considered by the board of directors. In reaching its decision to determine and declare the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders and to approve the execution,\ndelivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to resolve to recommend\nthat the holders of common stock approve the merger proposal, the board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to, and did\nnot make specific assessments of, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The board\nof directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.\nThe above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking\nstatements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements.\u201d\n44\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and determined the merger agreement and\nthe transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our\nstockholders. Our board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\nAs a matter of general practice, due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections,\nwe do not publicly disclose detailed projections as to our anticipated financial position or results of operations, other than providing, from time to\ntime, estimated ranges for the then-current fiscal year of certain expected financial results and operational metrics in our regular earnings press\nreleases and other investor materials.\nHowever, in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction, our management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information\nfor the Company on a consolidated basis for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2026, which we refer to as the \u201cfinancial\nprojections\u201d, which is summarized below. Such financial projections were provided to our board of directors, and to Goldman Sachs for use in\nconnection with its financial analyses and fairness opinion.\nThese financial projections were not intended for public disclosure, and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the\nSEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts or\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent\naccountants have audited, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections nor expressed an opinion or any form of\nassurance on the financial projections or their achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such financial\nprojections. A summary of the financial projections is included in this proxy statement only because the financial projections were made available to\nour board of directors and Goldman Sachs as described in this proxy statement. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement\ndoes not constitute an admission or representation by us that the information contained therein is material information.\nIn the view of our management, the financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management\u2019s best available estimates and\njudgments regarding our future financial performance at the time they were prepared. The financial projections have been included only to reflect\ninformation made available to our board of directors and Goldman Sachs at the time of certain events and decisions, are not facts and should not be\nrelied upon as indicative of actual future results, and you are cautioned not to rely on the financial projections. Some or all of the assumptions that\nhave been made in connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial projections were\nprepared. None of the Company or any of our affiliates, advisors or other representatives assumes any responsibility for the validity,\nreasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the financial projections. Neither the Company nor any of our affiliates have or intend to, and each of\nthem disclaims any obligation to, update, revise or correct the financial projections if any or all of them have become or become inaccurate (even in\nthe short term) since the time of their preparation.

LLC\u201d beginning on page 47 of this proxy statement).\nOur management made various assumptions when preparing the financial projections. These assumptions include annualized revenue growth of\napproximately 7% on average from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2026, annualized adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 9% on\naverage from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2026, annualized Core FFO/Share growth of approximately 11% on average from fiscal year end\n2022 to fiscal year end 2026 and annualized AFFO/Share growth of approximately 11% on average from fiscal year end 2022 to fiscal year end 2026.\nFiscal Year Ending December 31,\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n(in millions, except for per share amounts)\nTotal GAAP Revenues ..............................................................\n$420\n$463\n$504\n$536\n$560\nTotal GAAP Net Operating Income (\u201cNOI\u201d) ............................\n$271\n$305\n$335\n$356\n$369\nTotal Cash NOI(1) ......................................................................\n$262\n$292\n$327\n$350\n$364\nAdjusted EBITDA(2) .................................................................\n$234\n$263\n$296\n$317\n$330\nCore Funds from Operations (\u201cCore FFO\u201d) Per Share(3) .........\n$0.83\n$0.98\n$1.13\n$1.25\n$1.28\nTotal CapEx ................................................................................\n$55\n$42\n$31\n$33\n$32\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) Per Share(4) .........\n$0.83\n$0.78\n$1.04\n$1.28\n$1.28\nDividends Per Share ....................................................................\n$0.70\n$0.70\n$0.75\n$0.80\n$0.80\nPreferred Shares Outstanding .....................................................\n1.5\n1.4\n1.1\n0.7\n0.6\nCommon Shares Outstanding ....................................................\n67.0\n83.7\n104.7\n130.6\n144.2\n_________\n(1) Total Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net operating income as a measure of operating performance or\ncash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Total Cash NOI was calculated as Total GAAP Net Operating Income less Total GAAP Revenues which\nincludes straight-line rent and amortization of above / below market lease intangibles.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow\nfrom operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA was calculated as net income adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) from sales of depreciated\nproperty, income tax expense (or benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciated property, similar adjustments for unconsolidated\nentities, certain nonroutine charges, write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs, and transaction and\nintegration costs, as well as our pro-rata share of each of those respective expenses associated with unconsolidated entities, and certain non-cash recurring costs such as\nequity-based compensation.\n(3) Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from\noperating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Core FFO was calculated by: (i) adding to net income depreciation and amortization related to real estate, losses from the\nsale of certain real estate assets, losses from change in control, impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is\ndirectly attributable to decreases in the value of\n46\ndepreciable real estate held by the entity, acquisition and pursuit (dead deal) costs, loan cost amortization on acquisition line of credit and loan coordination fees, losses on\ndebt extinguishments or refinancing costs, internalization costs, expenses incurred on calls of preferred stock, deemed dividends for redemptions of and non-cash\ndividends on preferred stock and expenses related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and (ii) subtracting from net income gains from the sale of certain real estate assets,\ngains from change in control and earnest money forfeitures by prospective asset purchasers. Core FFO per share was calculated by dividing Core FFO by the weighted\naverage basic shares outstanding. Our calculation of Core FFO may differ from methodologies utilized by other REITs for similar performance measurements and,\naccordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs.\n(4) AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from\noperating activities or as a measure of liquidity. AFFO was calculated by: (i) adding to Core FFO non-cash equity compensation to directors and executives, non-cash\nexpense for current expected credit losses, amortization of loan closing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, net loan origination fees received,\ndeferred interest income received, amortization of lease inducements, cash received in excess of amortization of purchase option termination revenues and earnest\nmoney forfeiture from prospective asset purchaser and (ii) subtracting from Core FFO non-cash income for current expected credit losses, non-cash loan interest income,\ncash paid for loan closing costs, amortization of straight-line rent adjustments and acquired real estate intangible assets and/or liabilities, amortization of deferred\nrevenues, cash received exceeded by amortization of purchase option termination revenues, normally-recurring capital expenditures and capitalized second generation\nleasing costs. AFFO per share was calculated by dividing AFFO by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. Our calculation of AFFO may differ from methodologies\nutilized by other REITs for similar performance measurements and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs.\nOpinion of Our Financial Advisor\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nAt the February 16, 2022 meeting of the board of directors, Goldman Sachs rendered to the board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently\nconfirmed in its written opinion dated February 16, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the\nholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view\nto such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 16, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, is attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety.

The summary of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\ncontained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019\nadvisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors in connection with its consideration of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of\ncommon stock should vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other\nthings:\n\u2022the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company\u037e\n\u2022certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders\u037e\n\u2022certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company\u037e and\n\u2022certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nCompany (referred to in this section as the \u201cfinancial projections\u201d and which are summarized in the section entitled \u201c-Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d).\n47\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current\nbusiness operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of\ncommon stock\u037e compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the\nsecurities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the real estate industry\u037e and\nperformed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of our board of directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman\nSachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of our\nboard of directors that the financial projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments\nof the management of the Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any\ncontingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not\nfurnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals\nnecessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be obtained without any adverse effect on the\nexpected benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis. Goldman Sachs\nassumed that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement,\nwithout the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, or the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to any strategic alternatives that\nmay be available to the Company, including a certain non-binding proposal provided by a third party (referred to as Party A in the section entitled\n\u201c-Background of the Mergers\u201d) for a transaction at a price per share of common stock in cash greater than that in the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement (as described in the section entitled \u201c-Background of the Mergers\u201d), which non-binding proposal our board of directors\nadvised Goldman Sachs it determined not to pursue until after the execution of the merger agreement in accordance with the relevant terms of the\nmerger agreement\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not\nsolicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any other alternative\ntransaction prior to the execution of the merger agreement, but did solicit interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other\nbusiness combination with, the Company during the go-shop period. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of\nview to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock, as of the date of its opinion, of the $25.00 in cash per share\nof common stock to be paid to such holders. Goldman Sachs did not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or\naspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or\ninstrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, including the partnership merger and the operations merger, or the fairness of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\nto, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the\nCompany\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of\nthe Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, whether relative to the $25.00 in\ncash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger\nagreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of common stock would trade at any time,\nor as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, or as to the impact of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the solvency or viability of the Company, the\nPartnership, Operations or Parent or the ability of the Company, the Partnership, Operations or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they\ncome due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information\nmade available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming\nits opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of the opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 advisory services\n48\nand its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors in connection with its consideration of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of the shares of common\nstock should vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter.

below based on the $25.00 in cash per share of common\nstock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $25.00 in cash per share of common stock relative to:\n\u2022$17.96, the closing price of the shares of common stock on February 9, 2022, the

publicly available data obtained from SNL, certain financial information for the Company to\ncorresponding financial information and public market multiples for Bluerock and the selected publicly traded real estate investment trusts listed\nbelow in the multifamily segment (which are referred to in this section as the \u201cmultifamily selected companies\u201d) and the grocery-anchored retail\nsegment (which are referred to in this section as the \u201cgrocery-anchored selected companies\u201d and together with the multifamily selected companies,\nthe \u201cselected companies\u201d). Although none of the selected companies or Bluerock is directly comparable to the Company, the selected companies\nand Bluerock were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to\ncertain operations of the Company.\nFor each of the Company, Bluerock and the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared:\n\u2022the closing price per share, as of February 11, 2022 (with respect to the Company, as of February 9, 2022, and with respect to Bluerock, the price per\nshare implied by the announced acquisition of Bluerock by affiliates of Blackstone), as a multiple of the next twelve months\u2019 (which we refer to as\n\u201cNTM\u201d) FFO for such company (which is referred to in the table below as \u201cCurrent P/NTM FFO\u201d)\u037e\n50\n\u2022the average of each company\u2019s historical price to NTM FFO multiples for the 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ended February 11, 2022 (which is referred\nto in the table below as \u201cLast 1 Year Average P/NTM FFO,\u201d \u201cLast 3 Year Average P/NTM FFO,\u201d and \u201cLast 5 Year Average P/NTM FFO,\u201d\nrespectively)\u037e and\n\u2022the weighted average price to NTM FFO multiple for the selected companies as of February 11, 2022 and for the 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ended\nFebruary 11, 2022, calculated based on the median of each of the multifamily selected companies\u2019 and the grocery-anchored selected companies\u2019\naverage price to NTM FFO multiples for such periods (applying 70% and 30% weightings for the multifamily selected companies and the grocery\nanchored selected companies, respectively).\nThe multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs for the Company, Bluerock and the selected companies are as follows:\nCompany / Selected Company / Segment\nCurrent\nP/NTM FFO\nLast 1 Year Average\nP/NTM FFO\nLast 3 Years Average\nP/NTM FFO\nLast 5 Years\nAverage P/NTM\nFFO\nCompany\n20.8x\n14.7x\n10.9x\n10.8x\nBluerock\n37.4x\n18.6x\n15.0x\n15.0x\nMultifamily Selected Companies\nCamden Property Trust\n26.5x\n25.8x\n21.6x\n20.4x\nNexPoint Residential Trust Inc.\n30.8x\n25.3x\n21.7x\n19.6x\nMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n26.4x\n25.9x\n21.4x\n19.4x\nCenterspace\n21.8x\n22.7x\n20.1x\n18.1x\nIndependence Realty Trust Inc.\n26.1x\n23.7x\n18.5x\n16.2x\nMultifamily Selected Companies Median\n26.4x\n25.3x\n21.4x\n19.4x\nGrocery-Anchored Selected Companies\nRegency Centers Corporation\n16.8x\n18.7x\n16.1x\n16.4x\nRetail Opportunity Investments Corp.\n17.5x\n17.3x\n14.8x\n15.3x\nUrstadt Biddle Properties Inc.\n12.3x\n13.0x\n12.8x\n13.9x\nKimco Realty Corp.\n15.9x\n16.3x\n13.1x\n12.6x\nBrixmor Property Group Inc.\n13.1x\n13.1x\n10.4x\n9.7x\nGrocery-Anchored Selected Companies Median\n15.9x\n16.3x\n13.1x\n13.9x\nSelected Companies Weighted Average\n23.3x\n22.6x\n18.9x\n17.8x\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of common stock, based on theoretical\nfuture prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of common stock.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of common stock as of December 31 of each of 2021, 2022, 2023,\n2024 and 2025 by applying the illustrative price to next twelve months\u2019 Core FFO multiples ranging from 13.5x to 23.5x to estimates of the Core FFO\nof the Company for each of fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, as reflected in the financial projections. By applying a\ndiscount rate of 9.9%, reflecting an estimate of the Company\u2019s cost of equity, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value, as of December 31, 2021,\nand summed, both the theoretical future values per share of common stock it derived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be\npaid per share of common stock on a stand-alone basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the financial projections, to yield\nillustrative present values per share of common stock ranging from $12.76 to $24.00.\nThe illustrative price to next twelve months\u2019 Core FFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by Goldman Sachs using its\nprofessional judgement and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under \u201c-Selected Publicly\nTraded Companies Analysis.\u201d Goldman Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the capital asset pricing\nmodel (which we\n51\nrefer to as \u201cCAPM\u201d), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nUnited States financial markets generally.\nIllustrative Levered Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative levered discounted cash flow analysis on the Company to derive a range\nof illustrative present values per share of common stock.\nUsing discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 11.5%, reflecting estimates of the cost of equity of the Company, Goldman Sachs derived a range of\nillustrative present values per share of common stock, by discounting to present value as of December 31, 2021, (a) the estimates of the levered free\ncash flow to be generated by the Company for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026, as reflected in the financial projections, and (b)\na range of illustrative terminal values for the Company as of December 31, 2026, calculated by applying a range of terminal year multiples of 13.5x to\n23.5x to the Company\u2019s estimated terminal year Core FFO as reflected in the financial projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates\nranging from 1.0% to 6.9%). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific\ninputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of terminal\nyear multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated by\nGoldman Sachs as set forth above under \u201c-Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative present values per share of common stock by adding the ranges of present values it calculated for the\nlevered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above, and then dividing the result by the implied total number of fully diluted\nshares of common stock estimated to be outstanding as of February 9, 2022, as provided by management of the Company. This analysis resulted in\na range of illustrative present values per share of common stock of $13.04 to $23.56.\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the premia paid in all-cash acquisition transactions of publicly traded\nREITs in the United States and Canada announced since 2015 through February 15, 2022 (excluding transactions announced but terminated prior to\nclosing) in which the target company had an implied enterprise value of greater than $500 million.\nFor the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the 25  percentile, median, mean and 75  percentile premia of\nthe price paid in the identified transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to the announcement of the transaction.\nThis analysis indicated a 25  percentile premium of 13.3%, a median premium of 19.4%, a mean premium of 26.0% and a 75  percentile premium of\n25.6%. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs then applied an illustrative premia range of 13.3% to 25.6%, corresponding to the 25  and 75\npercentiles premia described above, to the undisturbed closing price per share of common stock of $17.96, the Pre-Bloomberg Article Share Price,\nand calculated a range of implied values per share of common stock of $20.36 to $22.56.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses\nand did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness\non the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the\nabove analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the shares of common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $25.00 in cash per share\nof common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they\nnecessarily reflect the\nth\nth\nth\nth\nth\nth\n52\nprices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon projections of future results are not necessarily indicative of\nactual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently\nsubject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the\nCompany, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe consideration of $25.00 in cash per share of common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and\nParent and was approved by the board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the board of directors during these negotiations. Goldman\nSachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or that any specific amount of consideration constituted\nthe only appropriate consideration for the mergers.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the board of directors\nin making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses\nperformed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to the board of directors and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment\nmanagement and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and\nemployees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at\nany time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit\ndefault swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Blackstone, an\naffiliate of Parent, and its affiliates and portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and has participated in certain of the\nnegotiations leading to, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in\nconnection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of its expenses arising, and indemnify\nGoldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may arise, out of its engagement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or\nunderwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has\nreceived, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to its sale of a portfolio of office\nassets in July 2021. During the two-year period ended February 16, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or\nunderwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to the Company and/or its affiliates of approximately $2.5 million as determined\nby Goldman Sachs based on its books and records. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to\nBlackstone and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive,\ncompensation, including having acted as left lead bookrunner with respect to a public offering of 4.25% Notes due 2026 (aggregate principal\namount $750,000,000) by Blue Yonder Group, Inc., a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, in July 2020\u037e as lead arranger with\nrespect to the floating rate securitization (aggregate principal amount $630,000,000) entered into by Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, an affiliate of\nBlackstone, in August 2020\u037e as a bookrunner with respect to the term loan B facility (aggregate principal amount $1,670,000,000) and the 4.75%\nsecured notes due 2027 (aggregate principal amount $375,000,000) issued by the Michaels Companies, Inc., a portfolio company of funds\nassociated with Blackstone, in September 2020\u037e as financial advisor to Rothesay Life plc, a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone,\nwith respect to the sale of Blackstone\u2019s equity interest in December 2020\u037e as financial advisor to BioMed Realty Trust Inc., a portfolio company of\nfunds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its recapitalization into a new fund affiliated with Blackstone in November 2020\u037e as financial\nadvisor to Change Healthcare Inc., a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its pending sale to UnitedHealth\nGroup announced in January 2021\u037e as left lead bookrunner with respect to a term loan repricing and add on (aggregate principal amount\n$1,460,000,000) by BME Group Holding BV, a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, in March 2021\u037e as financial advisor to a\nconsortium of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, an affiliate of Blackstone, and B&J Holdings Limited with respect to the consortium\u2019s\nrecommended offer to acquire Applegreen plc in March 2021\u037e as left lead bookrunner with respect to a follow-on public offering of the equity of\nTaskUS LLC, a portfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, in October 2021\u037e as a bookrunner for Medline Industries Inc., a portfolio\ncompany of\n53\nfunds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its bridge financing completed in October 2021\u037e and as financial advisor to Aqua Finance Inc., a\nportfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its pending sale to Apollo, announced in November 2021. During the two-\nyear period ended February 16, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by\nits Investment Banking Division to Blackstone and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies of approximately $359 million as determined by Goldman\nSachs based on its books and records. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the\nCompany, Parent, Blackstone and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, for which the Investment Banking Division of\nGoldman Sachs may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with Blackstone and its affiliates from time to\ntime and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Blackstone from time to time and may do so in the future.\nThe Company selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has\nsubstantial experience in transactions similar to the mergers. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, dated\nFebruary 15, 2022, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers. The engagement letter\nprovides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of the merger agreement, at\napproximately $36 million, $1 million of which was payable upon announcement of the merger agreement and the remainder of which is contingent\nupon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for\ncertain of its actual, out-of-pocket, documented and reasonable expenses, including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements,\nand to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nFinancing\nIn connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $3.5 billion to be paid to the holders of common\nstock (assuming the cash exercise of all outstanding company warrants), preferred stock, time-vested restricted stock, earned PSUs, earned RSUs,\ntime-vested RSUs, Class A partnership units and operations preferred shares (in each case other than excluded securities). Parent has informed us\nthat in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any,\nto be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of April 11, 2022 we had\nno outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and as of March 31, 2022 we had approximately $2.4 billion in mortgage loans\noutstanding.\nParent has informed us that it currently intends to pursue obtaining debt financing to be provided in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is\nexpected that the Sponsor and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger\nconsideration) that are not covered by such debt financing.\nParent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing\nmay be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other\ncosts and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under\nthe potential debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned\nby us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the\napplicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar\nfinancings.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of the mergers. We have agreed to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary\ncooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries,\nor our or our subsidiaries\u2019 real property.

            "page_content": "funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its bridge financing completed in October 2021\u037e and as financial advisor to Aqua Finance Inc., a\nportfolio company of funds associated with Blackstone, with respect to its pending sale to Apollo, announced in November 2021. During the two-\nyear period ended February 16, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by\nits Investment Banking Division to Blackstone and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies of approximately $359 million as determined by Goldman\nSachs based on its books and records. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the\nCompany, Parent, Blackstone and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, for which the Investment Banking Division of\nGoldman Sachs may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with Blackstone and its affiliates from time to\ntime and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Blackstone from time to time and may do so in the future.\nThe Company selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has\nsubstantial experience in transactions similar to the mergers. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, dated\nFebruary 15, 2022, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers. The engagement letter\nprovides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the announcement of the merger agreement, at\napproximately $36 million, $1 million of which was payable upon announcement of the merger agreement and the remainder of which is contingent\nupon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for\ncertain of its actual, out-of-pocket, documented and reasonable expenses, including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements,\nand to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nFinancing\nIn connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $3.5 billion to be paid to the holders of common\nstock (assuming the cash exercise of all outstanding company warrants), preferred stock, time-vested restricted stock, earned PSUs, earned RSUs,\ntime-vested RSUs, Class A partnership units and operations preferred shares (in each case other than excluded securities). Parent has informed us\nthat in connection with the closing of the mergers, Parent expects to cause the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any,\nto be repaid in full. Parent has also informed us that it expects our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of April 11, 2022 we had\nno outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and as of March 31, 2022 we had approximately $2.4 billion in mortgage loans\noutstanding.\nParent has informed us that it currently intends to pursue obtaining debt financing to be provided in connection with the mergers. In addition, it is\nexpected that the Sponsor and its affiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger\nconsideration) that are not covered by such debt financing.\nParent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing\nmay be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other\ncosts and expenses related to the financing and the mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under\nthe potential debt financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned\nby us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the\napplicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar\nfinancings.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of the mergers. We have agreed to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all customary\ncooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the arrangement of debt financing with respect to us or our subsidiaries,\nor our or our subsidiaries\u2019 real property. For more information, see the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Financing Cooperation\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers.\u201d\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers\nIn considering the recommendation of our board of directors to approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other proposals described above,\nour stockholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition\nto, the interests of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these\ninterests and\n54\nconsidered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to determine and declare the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, to be advisable and in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests to\napprove the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and to\nresolve to recommend that the common stockholders approve the merger. These interests are discussed below.\nSection 16(b) Exemption Resolution\nOur board of directors believes that it is desirable that the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers be relieved of the risk of liability under\nSection 16 of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the exchange of shares of common stock\npursuant to the merger. Accordingly, our board of directors (or a committee thereof) intends to adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by\nthe Company\u2019s executive officers and directors of our common stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the merger, are intended to be\nexempt from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated thereunder.\nTreatment of Compensatory Awards\nOur executive officers hold time-vested restricted stock, performance stock units and restricted stock units, as applicable, as further set forth in the\nsection entitled \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.\u201d We are not including\ninformation with respect to any former executive officers of the Company who are not current executive officers and who have no interest in the\nmerger.\nTime-Vested Restricted Stock. The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding time-vested\nrestricted stock granted pursuant to the long-term incentive plans will automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and reacquisition rights\nthereon will lapse, and thereafter all shares of common stock represented thereby will be considered outstanding for all purposes under the merger\nagreement and will have the right to receive the common stock consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nPerformance Stock Units. The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the merger effective time, each outstanding performance stock\nunit granted pursuant to the long-term incentive plans, which remains subject to vesting based all or in part on future achievement of performance\ngoals, will become earned and vested with respect to that number of shares of common stock subject to such performance stock unit in accordance\nwith the terms of such performance stock unit (but without applying any pro-ration for the number of days of employment during the shortened\nperformance period ending on the closing date) based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth in the award agreement\ngoverning such performance stock unit (as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors) as measured from the beginning\nof the applicable performance period through the closing date (or the latest practicable date prior thereto that performance can be assessed). At the\nmerger effective time, each earned PSU will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any\napplicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned PSU. Additionally, in no event later\nthan five business days after the merger effective time or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences\nunder Section 409A of the Code, we will pay to each holder of earned PSUs an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid cash dividends thereon, less\nany applicable withholding taxes. Each performance stock unit that does not become an earned PSU will terminate without consideration\nimmediately prior to the merger effective time.\nRestricted Stock Units. The merger agreement provides that, (1) each market cap restricted stock unit issued and outstanding as of immediately\nprior to the merger effective time that is an earned RSU, and (2) each time-vested RSU (whether vested or unvested) issued and outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the merger effective time, will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and less any\napplicable income and employment withholding taxes) equal to the common stock consideration for each earned RSU or time-vested RSU (as\napplicable). Any issued and outstanding market cap restricted stock unit that is not an earned RSU as of immediately prior to the merger effective\ntime will terminate without consideration immediately prior to the merger effective time.\nValue of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would become payable to each of our named executive\nofficers, see \u201c- Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\u201d below. The estimated value\nof the payments that will be made to our other executive officers, Mr. Aide and Mr. Sprain, at the merger effective time in respect of their\noutstanding Company restricted stock awards, PSUs, and dividend equivalent rights is $2,953,435, which is based on the number of outstanding\nawards held by these current executive officers as of April 11, 2022. The estimated value of the payments that will be made to our non-employee\ndirectors at the merger effective time in respect of their outstanding Company restricted share awards is $1,238,800, which is based on the number\nof outstanding awards held by the non-employee directors as of April 11, 2022. These estimated values assume (a) that PSUs that vest based on\n55\nrelative total stockholder return will be earned based on maximum performance levels, and (b) that all time-based restricted stock and PSU awards\n(and any accrued but unpaid dividends or dividend equivalents relating thereto) held by each of our current executive officers and our non-\nemployee directors, as applicable, as of April 11, 2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing, remain outstanding as of the merger\neffective time and each of them does not receive any additional compensatory awards between such date and the merger effective time.\nTreatment of Interests in the Partnership\nOur executive officers hold Class A partnership units, as further set forth in the section entitled \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments to Our\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\u201d.\nClass A Partnership Units. The merger agreement provides that, at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A partnership unit, or fraction\nthereof, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than excluded Class A partnership units) will\nbe automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the partnership unit consideration, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes. As discussed above, if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the\nCode, or to avoid or reduce the incurrence of income or excise taxes under the Code, in each case, as permitted under the merger agreement, the\npartnership unit consideration will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend on the common stock.\nClass B Partnership Units. The merger agreement provides that each vested Class B partnership unit, or fraction thereof, that is issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time that becomes an \u201cEarned Class B Unit\u201d (pursuant to the terms of the\napplicable award agreement) and which has a \u201cCapital Account\u201d (as defined in the partnership agreement) equal to the \u201cAverage Capital Account\nBalance\u201d (as defined in the partnership agreement) (taking into account any allocations that would be deemed to occur pursuant to the terms of the\npartnership agreement) will automatically be converted into a Class A partnership unit. Thereafter, the Class A partnership units issued in respect of\nthe converted Earned Class B Units will be treated as Class A partnership units for purposes of the merger agreement (as set forth above). Pursuant\nto the award agreements, all of the Class B partnership units became Earned Class B Units and converted into Class A partnership units on March\n31, 2022, and as such, the provisions in the merger agreement applicable to the conversion of unvested Class B partnership units no longer apply.\nThe Class B partnership unit award agreements provide that to the extent the payments payable under the Class B Unit award agreement are in the\nnature of compensation and are contingent on a change in the ownership of the Company and would be subject (in whole or in part) to an excise tax\nimposed by reason of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax, the\n\u201cexcise tax\u201d), the executive will receive an additional payment (the \u201cexcise tax gross-up payment\u201d) in an amount such that, after payment by the\nexecutive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes and excise\ntax imposed upon the excise tax gross-up payment, the executive will retain an amount equal to the excise tax imposed on the payments provided\nunder the Class B Unit award agreement.\nValue of Payments. For purposes of this disclosure, we have assumed that all Class B partnership units that converted to Class A partnership units\non March 31, 2022 will be valued based on the $25.00 per share common stock consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement, but that no\nexcise tax gross-up payment will apply under these Class B partnership units due to the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. For an\nestimate of the value of the Class A partnership units that were issued upon the conversion of the Class B partnership units on March 31, 2022 to\neach of our named executive officers, see \u201c- Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\u201d\nbelow. The estimated value of Class A partnership units that were issued on March 31, 2022 to Messrs. Cronin, Sherman and Aide who held\noutstanding Class B partnership units as of March 15, 2022, is $244,300, $152,700 and $91,625, which is based on the number of outstanding Class B\npartnership units held as of March 15, 2022. As of April 11, 2022, Messrs. Isakson, Cronin, Sherman, and Aide beneficially owned 20,551, 9,772,\n9,513, and 7,071 Class A partnership units, respectively, and owned no Class B partnership units. Messrs. Isakson, Cronin, Sherman, and Aide will\nreceive aggregate consideration of approximately $513,775, $244,300, $237,825 and $176,775, respectively, with respect to such Class A partnership\nunits in the merger. For a more complete discussion of the treatment of the Class A partnership units, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of\nInterests in the Partnership.\u201d\nExecutive Severance Benefits\nArrangements. None of our executive officers are party to an individual employment agreement providing for severance upon a termination of\nemployment. However, the Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. Executive\n56\nSeverance and Change in Control Plan (the \u201cSeverance Plan\u201d) provides certain severance benefits in the case of a qualifying termination of\nemployment, which is defined as a termination by the Company without cause or a resignation by the executive for good reason, as those terms are\ndefined in the Severance Plan or in the participating executive\u2019s participation agreement thereunder, including a qualifying termination in\nconnection with a change in control. Consistent with our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the Severance Plan also provides for a payout of performance-\nbased equity awards upon a change in control, based on actual performance through the date of the change in control. All of our named executive\nofficers and other current executive officers are participants in the Severance Plan.\nUnder the Severance Plan, if a plan participant\u2019s employment with us is terminated by the participant for good reason or by us other than for cause,\nin each case within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in the Severance Plan) and other than as a result of the participant\u2019s death\nor disability, the participant is entitled to receive (1) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 1.50 (3.0 for the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer), multiplied by the sum of (a) an amount equivalent to twelve (12) months of the participant\u2019s base salary, and (b) the\nparticipant\u2019s target annual performance bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control\u037e plus (2) continued group health care\ncontinuation at the active employee rate for up to 18 months (36 months for the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer)\nfollowing termination of employment, but subject to cessation once the participant becomes eligible for coverage from a new employer\u037e (3) a pro-\nrated annual bonus (based on the target amount) for the calendar year in which the participant\u2019s employment termination date occurs\u037e and (4)\naccelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards, as determined by the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and the award agreements. Payments are\ngenerally made sixty (60) days following termination.\nAny payments payable under the Severance Plan are conditioned on the execution and non-revocation of a release for the benefit of the Company\nand its related entities and agents.\nRestrictive Covenants. Any payments payable under the Severance Plan are also subject to the executive\u2019s compliance with certain confidentiality,\nnon-disparagement, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants that apply during the executive\u2019s employment and for a specified period\nthereafter. The non-competition period applies during employment and ranges from 6 to 12 months following termination of employment. The non-\nsolicitation period is during employment and the 24 months following termination of employment. The non-disparagement period is during\nemployment and 36 months following termination of employment. The confidentiality period is during employment and perpetual following\ntermination of employment.\nGolden Parachute Excise Tax. The Severance Plan does not provide a tax gross-up provision for federal excise taxes that may be imposed under\nsections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Instead, the Severance Plan provides that if amounts payable to a participant under the Severance Plan,\ntogether with any other amounts that are payable by the Company as a result of a change in control, exceed the amount allowed under section 280G\nof the Code for such individual, thereby subjecting the individual to an excise tax under section 4999 of Code, then, depending on which method\nproduces the better net after-tax benefit for the recipient, such payments shall either be: (1) reduced to the level at which no excise tax applies or (2)\npaid in full, with the participant being responsible for his or her excise and other taxes.\nValue of Payments. For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would become payable to each of our\nnamed executive officers upon a severance-qualifying termination, see \u201c- Quantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Mergers\u201d below. The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable upon a\nseverance-qualifying termination of employment for our other executive officers, Messrs. Aide and Sprain, is $952,773 and $834,127, respectively.\nIndemnification of Our Directors and Officers\nThe merger agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and after the merger effective time and ending on the\nsixth anniversary of the merger effective time, the Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to: (1) indemnify, defend\nand hold harmless each of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current or former managers, directors, officers and trustees (which persons we refer to as the\n\u201cindemnified parties\u201d), against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,\nliabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, cause of action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, mediation,\ninterference, audit, assessment, hearing or other legal proceeding (we refer to the foregoing as an \u201caction\u201d), arising out of or pertaining to any\naction or omission or alleged action or omission in such indemnified party\u2019s capacity as a manager, director, officer or trustee of the Company or\nany of our subsidiaries arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger effective time (and whether asserted or claimed prior\nto, at or after the merger effective time), including such alleged acts or omissions with respect to the merger agreement or any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers\u037e and (2) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such action the expenses\n(including\n57\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and any expenses incurred by any indemnified party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to\nindemnification) of any indemnified party without the requirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by law,\nbut subject to Parent\u2019s or the Surviving Company\u2019s receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified party to repay such amount if it\nshall ultimately be determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified.\nThe parties have agreed not to terminate or modify the obligations described above regarding indemnification of the indemnified parties in such a\nmanner as to adversely affect such indemnified parties, and such obligations must be assumed by any successor entity to the Surviving Company\nas a result of any consolidation, merger, dissolution or transfer of all or substantially all of its properties and assets.\nThe merger agreement also requires that, prior to the merger effective time, we will bind, effective at the merger effective time, extended coverage\nunder our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy by obtaining a prepaid six-year \u201ctail\u201d extended period on our existing officers\u2019 and\ndirectors\u2019 liability insurance policies (or with insurers on terms and conditions no less favorable than such policies), which prepaid policies provide\nsuch persons currently covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or\nevents that occurred on or before the merger effective time, for an overall additional premium not to exceed 300% of the total annual premiums at the\nlast renewal\u037e provided, that we will reasonably cooperate and consult with Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy\u037e provided, further,\nthat if Parent can procure a \u201ctail\u201d policy on superior terms or on equivalent terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be\nprocured by us, then, subject to certain terms and conditions, Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the merger effective time, in which case\nwe shall not obtain such policy. Additionally, Parent and the Surviving Company are required to maintain such policies in full force and effect for\ntheir full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.\nDirector Transaction Fees\nOur board of directors approved a fee of $20,000 to each member of the Transaction Committee, a fee of $15,000 to members of our board of\ndirectors that were not on the Transaction Committee, and a fee of $30,000 to Mr. McLure (chairman of the Transaction Committee) in connection\nwith the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nQuantification of Potential Payments to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information\nabout certain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. We have omitted any\nnamed executive officer who is no longer an executive officer and who is not entitled to any payments or benefits in connection with the mergers.\nSolely for purposes of the table below, it is assumed that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination immediately\nfollowing the merger effective time. Such amounts have been calculated assuming the merger effective time occurs on April 11, 2022. For\nadditional details regarding the terms of the payments described below, see the discussion under \u201c- Interests of Our Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Mergers\u201d above.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that may be paid or become payable to each of the named executive officers in\nconnection with the mergers pursuant to all applicable compensation plans or agreements, assuming that the merger effective time occurred on\nApril 11, 2022, which is the latest practicable date prior to the date of this filing and the assumed date of the merger effective time solely for\npurposes of this merger-related compensation disclosure and that each named executive officer incurs a severance-qualifying termination\nimmediately following the merger effective time.\n58\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nName\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity ($)(2)\nPerquisites/ Benefits\n($)(3)\nTotal ($)\nJoel T.

These amounts include the value of PSUs that would accelerate in full at the merger effective time, based on actual performance through\nthe date of the change in control. These amounts assume the performance metrics were achieved at maximum performance as of April 11, 2022. The value of the\naccelerated PSUs was calculated by multiplying the number of accelerated shares by $25.00 based on the common stock consideration pursuant to the merger\nagreement. These amounts also include (a) the value of time-based restricted stock awards, which accelerate in full in connection with the change in control, (b) cash\ndividends on PSUs, which are scheduled to be paid following the merger effective time, and (c) value of the Class B partnership units that were converted into\nClass A partnership units on March 31, 2022.\nNamed Executive Officer\nValue of Company\nRestricted Share\nAwards ($)\nValue of\nCompany\nPerformance\nUnits ($)\nValue of\nAccrued Cash\nDividends\nValue of\nClass A\npartnership\nunits\nTotal ($)\nJoel T.

The first suit, styled as\nStein v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02589-LAK, which we refer to as the \u201cStein Lawsuit,\u201d was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York. The second suit, styled as Wang v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., 1:22-\ncv-02641-LAK, which we refer to as the \u201cWang Lawsuit,\u201d was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nThe third suit, styled as Anderson v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01979-LDH-RML, which we refer to as the\n\u201cAnderson Lawsuit,\u201d was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The fourth suit, styled as Hopkins v.\nMurphy, et al., No. 24C22001775, which we refer to as the \u201cHopkins Lawsuit,\u201d was filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The fifth\nsuit, styled as Ferguson v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-03033, which we refer to as the \u201cFerguson Lawsuit,\u201d was filed\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nThe Stein Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors. The Stein Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff,\n(1) a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and its implementing regulations, alleging that purported omissions render the proxy\nstatement false and misleading\u037e and (2) a \u201ccontrol person\u201d claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a)\nviolation. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including line items used to calculate non-\nGAAP financial metrics, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, levered free cash flow information, and input data and\nassumptions used in Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange\nAct against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit\nseeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is\nconsummated, and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe Wang Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors. Like the Stein Lawsuit, the Wang Lawsuit asserts a claim\nunder Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our\nboard of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the same allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as\nthe Stein Lawsuit.\nThe Anderson Lawsuit, like the Stein Lawsuit and Wang Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors. The Anderson\nLawsuit also asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act\nagainst the members of our board of directors. The Anderson Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics,\nincluding certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP\nmetrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis, the Company\u2019s nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties, and\ndetails regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company\u2019s officers and directors. The Anderson Lawsuit seeks to enjoin\ndefendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act,\nrescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe Hopkins Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits\nmaterial information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of\nnon-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis, the Company\u2019s nondisclosure\nagreements with potential counterparties, information relating to the Company\u2019s engagement of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., and details\nregarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company\u2019s officers and directors. The Hopkins Lawsuit also alleges that the\nCompany\u2019s officers stand to benefit from the merger and that the price of the merger is unfair. Relying on those allegations, the Hopkins Lawsuit\nasserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors and a claim for declaratory and equitable relief against all defendants.\nThe Ferguson Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and its directors. The Ferguson Lawsuit, like the Stein, Wang, and Anderson Lawsuits,\nasserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants\n60"

Further, this discussion is for general\ninformation purposes only and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to specific holders in\nlight of their particular facts and circumstances, and it does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws,\nsuch as, for example:\n\u2022insurance companies\u037e\n\u2022dealers, brokers or traders in securities or currencies\u037e\n61\n\u2022traders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting\u037e\n\u2022broker-dealers\u037e\n\u2022persons acting as nominees or otherwise not as beneficial owners\u037e\n\u2022holders subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022persons who are required to recognize income or gain no later than such income or gain is required to be reported on an applicable financial\nstatement\u037e\n\u2022U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022tax-exempt entities and organizations\u037e\n\u2022retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred or advantaged accounts (or persons holding shares of common stock or\nshares of preferred stock through such plans or accounts)\u037e\n\u2022banks and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies\u037e\n\u2022partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other flow-through entities (and\ninvestors therein)\u037e\n\u2022S corporations\u037e\n\u2022REITs\u037e\n\u2022regulated investment companies\u037e\n\u2022holders who own or have owned at any time, or are deemed to own or to have owned at any time, directly, indirectly or constructively, at least 5%\nor more, by voting power or value, of our stock\u037e\n\u2022\u201cqualified foreign pension funds\u201d (within the meaning of Section 897(1)(2) of the Code) or entities all of the interests in which are held by a\nqualified pension fund\u037e\n\u2022\u201cqualified shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or investors therein\u037e\n\u2022non-U.S. holders who hold, or have held at any time, directly, indirectly, or constructively, more than 10% of our outstanding shares of common\nstock or more than 10% of our outstanding shares of preferred stock\u037e\n\u2022holders who hold shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other\nintegrated or risk reduction transaction\u037e or\n\u2022holders who acquired shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards,\nthrough a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation.\nIf a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of common stock or\nshares of preferred stock, the tax treatment of a partner in that partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of\nthe partnership. Such a partner or partnership is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax\nconsequences of the merger to it in light of its particular circumstances.\nDETERMINING THE ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO A HOLDER MAY BE COMPLEX AND WILL DEPEND ON A\nHOLDER\u2019S SPECIFIC SITUATION. ALL HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITH\nRESPECT TO THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS AND ANY\nPOTENTIAL CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.\nTax Classification of the Merger in General\nIt is expected the merger will be treated as (1) the adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation, and (2) a sale by the Company of all of its\nassets to Merger Sub I (or, if applicable, its regarded owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in exchange for the common stock consideration\nor preferred stock consideration, as applicable, to be provided to the holders of equity interests in the Company and the assumption of all of the\nCompany\u2019s liabilities, and any other applicable amounts, followed by a distribution of such common stock consideration or preferred stock\nconsideration, and any other applicable amounts, to the holders of equity interests in the Company in liquidation of the Company pursuant to\nSection 331 and Section 562 of the Code. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating distributions, and we\nanticipate that our deemed liquidating distribution will exceed our taxable income recognized as a result of the merger (together with any other\nundistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the merger). Accordingly, we anticipate that we will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on any gain that we recognize in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\n62\nIt is expected the operations merger will be treated as (1) the adoption by Operations of a plan of liquidation followed by (2) a taxable liquidation of\nOperations pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code. As a REIT, Operations is generally entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating\ndistributions, and we anticipate that Operation\u2019s deemed liquidating distribution will exceed its taxable income recognized as a result of the\noperations merger (together with any other undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the operations merger). Accordingly, we\nanticipate that we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain that Operations recognizes in connection with the operations merger.\nThe remainder of this discussion assumes that the merger and the operations merger will be treated as described above.\nConsequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock and preferred stock pursuant to the merger is expected to be treated as\na distribution in complete liquidation of the Company and a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder\nof shares of common stock will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween (1) the amount of cash received with respect to such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock in the merger, and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in its shares of common stock.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its\nadjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of common stock. Any such gain or loss will\ngenerally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of common stock\nsurrendered in the merger is greater than one year at the time of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including\nindividuals, are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nA U.S. holder who has held shares of common stock for less than six months at the time of the merger, taking into account the holding period rules\nof Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the exchange of such shares of common stock in the merger will be treated\nas recognizing a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from us, or such holder\u2019s share of any designated\nretained capital gains, with respect to such shares.\nConsequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\nGeneral\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a non-U.S. holder of payments made with respect to such non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock\nin connection with the merger will depend on various factors, including whether the receipt of such payments is treated as a distribution from the\nCompany that is attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs pursuant to the provisions of FIRPTA. The IRS announced in Notice 2007-55 that it\nintends to take the position that under current law a non-U.S. holder\u2019s receipt of a liquidating distribution from a REIT (including payments made in\nconnection with the merger, which as noted, are expected to be treated as distributions in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is generally subject to tax under FIRPTA as a distribution to the extent attributable to gain from the sale of USRPIs. Although\nlegislation effectively overriding Notice 2007-55 has previously been proposed, it is not possible to say if or when any such legislation will be\nenacted. Accordingly, we intend to take the position that payments made with respect the Company\u2019s shares of common stock pursuant to the\nmerger will be subject to tax in accordance with Notice 2007-55, subject to the 10% Exception, as described in more detail below. In general, the\nprovisions governing the taxation of distributions by REITs can be less favorable to non-U.S. holders than the taxation of sales or exchanges of\nREIT stock by non-U.S. holders, and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these provisions.\nDistribution of Gain from the Disposition of U.S. Real Property Interests\nTo the extent that the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 applies, and the 10% Exception described in the next paragraph below does not apply,\nthen, to the extent that payments received by a non-U.S. holder with respect to such non-U.S. holder\u2019s common stock pursuant to the merger are\ntreated as attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our USRPIs, such amounts will be treated as income effectively connected with a\nU.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder, and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis. A corporate non-U.S. holder\nwill also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty). In addition, 21% (or\n20% to the extent provided in the Treasury Regulations) of any such amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder will be withheld and remitted to the IRS.\n63\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of our common stock are considered \u201cregularly traded\u201d (within the meaning of the applicable Treasury\nRegulations) on an established securities market located in the United States and the non-U.S. holder did not hold more than 10% of such class of\nstock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the merger, the tax treatment and consequences described above would not\napply (the \u201c10% Exception\u201d), and non-U.S. holders would instead be subject to the rules described below under \u201c- Taxable Sale of Common Stock.\u201d\nWe believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be at the time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established securities\nmarket located in the United States within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors\nregarding tax consequences of the merger to them.\nTaxable Sale of Common Stock\nIf both (A) the tax treatment set forth in Notice 2007-55 were not to apply to a non-U.S. holder\u2019s receipt of payments with respect to such non-U.S.\nholder\u2019s shares of common stock pursuant to the merger and (B) either (1) the \u201cpublicly traded exception\u201d (as described below) applies or (2) we are\na \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d (as described below), such that the Company\u2019s shares of common stock do not constitute\nUSRPIs under FIRPTA with respect to such non-U.S. holder, then the non-U.S. holder should not be subject to tax on any gain recognized in\nconnection with the receipt of cash consideration payable pursuant to the merger (which, as described above under \u201c\u202f- Consequences of the\nMerger to U.S. Holders of Shares of Common Stock\u201d and subject to the discussion of Notice 2007-55 above, is generally expected to be treated as a\ndistribution in complete liquidation of the Company and as amounts received in full payment in exchange for such holder\u2019s shares of common\nstock) unless: (a) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if required\npursuant to an applicable income tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United\nStates\u037e or (b) the non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain\nother requirements are met.\nThe \u201cpublicly traded exception\u201d applies to a non-U.S. holder if our common stock is \u201cregularly traded,\u201d as defined by the applicable Treasury\nRegulations, and the non-U.S. holder has held 10% or less of the shares of common stock at all times during the shorter of the period that the non-\nU.S. holder owned such stock or the five-year period ending on the date of the merger. We believe that shares of our common stock are, and will be\nat the time of the merger, considered regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States within the meaning of the\napplicable Treasury Regulations.\nWe will be a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the time of the merger if non-U.S. holders held directly or indirectly less than\n50% in value of shares of our stock at all times during the five-year period ending with the merger. While we believe that the Company has been and\ncurrently is domestically controlled as of the date hereof, no assurances can be given that the actual ownership of shares of our stock has been or\nwill be sufficient for us to qualify as a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the time of the merger.\nA non-U.S. holder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or, if an applicable income tax\ntreaty requires, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) will generally be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be\nsubject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively\nconnected gain described above.\nA non-U.S. holder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and who meets certain\nother requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain recognized in connection with the merger, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source\ncapital losses of the non-U.S. holder.\nIf a non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by such holder on a sale of such stock will\nbe treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. holder (and, in the case of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation, the branch profits tax as described\nabove).\nIncome Tax Treaties\nIf a non-U.S. holder is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States, the non-U.S. holder may be able to reduce or\neliminate certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above, such as the branch profits tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult\ntheir tax advisor regarding possible benefits under an applicable income tax treaty.\n64\nU.S. Withholding Tax\nAs described above, it is not entirely clear whether the receipt of payments pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder will be treated as a sale or\nexchange of shares of common stock (if Notice 2007-55 does not apply) or as a distribution from the Company that is attributable to gain from the\ndeemed sale of the Company\u2019s USRPIs in the merger (if Notice 2007-55 does apply and the holder does not qualify for the 10% Exception described\nabove). Accordingly, we intend to withhold, pursuant to FIRPTA, U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in\napplicable Treasury Regulations) from the portion of the consideration paid to a non-U.S. holder to the extent attributable to gains that the\nCompany recognizes from sales of USRPIs, unless such non-U.S. holder qualifies for the 10% Exception described above. A non-U.S. holder may be\nentitled to a refund or credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, with respect to any amount withheld pursuant to FIRPTA\u037e\nprovided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisor regarding\nwithholding tax considerations.\nConsequences of the Merger to Holders of Shares of Preferred Stock\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of preferred stock will be treated as a taxable transaction. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to\nholders of shares of preferred stock generally will be the same as the consequences to holders of shares of our common stock described above with\nrespect to the merger, except that the capital gain or loss recognized by a holder of shares of preferred stock will be measured by the difference\nbetween the amount of cash the holder receives with respect to such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of preferred stock in the merger and such holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in shares of preferred stock. Consistent with IRS Notice 2007-55 (described above), and without limiting any of the above\ndiscussion, 21% (or 20% to the extent provided in U.S. Treasury Regulations) of any cash received by a non-U.S. holder with respect to its\npreferred stock, which is treated as a distribution attributable to gain from the deemed or actual sale of our USRPIs, will be withheld and remitted to\nthe IRS unless such holder qualifies for the 10% Exception discussed above.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the merger. Backup withholding will not apply,\nhowever, to a holder of shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer\nidentification number, certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on an IRS Form W-9, and otherwise complies with all\napplicable requirements of the backup withholding rules\u037e (2) in the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes an applicable IRS Form W-8\u037e or (3) provides\nproof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with other applicable rules and certification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a\nholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, so long as such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES\nONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.
