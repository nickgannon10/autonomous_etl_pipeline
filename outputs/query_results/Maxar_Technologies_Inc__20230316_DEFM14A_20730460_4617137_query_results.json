            "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in\nthe valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for\npassive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted\nsecurities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to\nadvise Maxar with respect to the Merger and deliver an opinion to the Board of Directors with respect to the\nMerger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in\nconnection with such matters and its familiarity with Maxar and the industries in which it operates.\nFor services rendered in connection with the Merger and the delivery of its opinion, Maxar has agreed\nto pay J.P. Morgan a fee of approximately $58,000,000, of which $3,000,000 became payable upon delivery of\nthe opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable upon the closing of the Merger. In\naddition, Maxar has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services\nand will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the\ntwo years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or\ninvestment banking relationships with Maxar for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received\ncustomary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunner\non Maxar\u2019s offering of debt securities in June 2022 and as joint lead bookrunner on Maxar\u2019s credit facility in\nJune 2022. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates\nhave had commercial or investment banking relationships with Advent for which J.P. Morgan and such\naffiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as\njoint lead bookrunner on Advent\u2019s offering of debt securities in February 2022, lead arranger on Advent\u2019s\ncredit facilities in March 2022 and financial advisor to Advent in connection with its acquisition, together\nwith certain co-investors, of McAfee Corp. in March 2022, as well as providing debt syndication, equity\nunderwriting and financial advisory services to Advent\u2019s portfolio companies. During the two-year period\npreceding delivery of its opinion ending on December 15, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan\nfrom Maxar were approximately $7,000,000 and from Advent and its portfolio companies were approximately\n$142,000,000. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under\noutstanding credit facilities of Advent portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or\nother financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1%\nof the outstanding Maxar common stock. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its\naffiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,\nbank loans or other obligations) of Maxar or Advent and Advent\u2019s portfolio companies for their own\naccounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short\npositions in such securities or other financial instruments.\nCertain Financial Projections\nWhile Maxar has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, Maxar has not, as a\nmatter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future performance, earnings, or\nother results beyond the then-current annual period due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of\naccurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and\nsubjectivity of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in the ordinary course, Maxar\u2019s\nmanagement prepares a long-term strategic plan, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the Board\nof Directors, that reflects Maxar\u2019s management\u2019s financial and business outlook for Maxar. In connection\nwith the proposed Merger, Maxar is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited\nprospective financial information of Maxar, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger,\nprepared by Maxar\u2019s management, solely because, as described below, certain financial information was\ngiven to the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration and evaluation of the Merger and to J.P.\nMorgan for its use and reliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by J.P. Morgan to the\nBoard of Directors and J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion as discussed in \u201c- Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.\u201d\nAt a meeting of the Board of Directors on July 28, 2022, Maxar\u2019s management provided to the Board of\nDirectors one set of non-public, unaudited financial projections included in Maxar\u2019s long-term strategic plan,\nwhich covered the second half of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 through the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2026 (referred to herein as the \u201cJuly 2022 Base Case Forecast\u201d), which forecast was based on\nand reflected, among other things, the following assumptions: (1) the successful launch by early 2023 of\neach of the six satellites that make up Maxar\u2019s WorldView Legion satellite program\u037e (2) the successful\noperation\n50 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nof Maxar\u2019s entire existing satellite constellation\u037e and (3) the successful execution of Maxar\u2019s strategy,\nincluding its growth strategy, across each of the Maxar\u2019s three business lines. Additionally, Maxar\u2019s\nmanagement provided a copy of the July 2022 Base Case Forecast to J.P. Morgan for use in its preliminary\nfinancial analysis of Maxar that was presented to the Board of Directors at the July 28, 2022 meeting.\nFrom time to time, Maxar\u2019s management has also prepared a \u201cdownside\u201d version of its long-term\nstrategic plan that assumed that one or more of Maxar\u2019s satellites would suffer a negative impact. In\nconnection with the Board of Directors\u2019 consideration of Advent\u2019s August 22 Letter, as defined and\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Background of the Merger,\u201d Maxar\u2019s management\nprepared a second set of non-public, unaudited financial projections for the second half of the fiscal year\nending December 31, 2022 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026 (such forecast is referred to in\nthis proxy statement as the \u201cOctober Satellite Loss Case Forecast\u201d), which forecast was based on and\nreflected, among other things, the following assumptions: (1) the permanent loss of two out of the six\nsatellites that make up Maxar\u2019s WorldView Legion satellite program (i.e., the complete failure of one launch in\nconnection with the WorldView Legion satellite program), the financial impact of which was also intended to\nrepresent either (A) the potential impact of the permanent loss of two out of the six satellites that make up\nMaxar\u2019s WorldView Legion satellite program or (B) the potential impact of the permanent loss of WorldView 3\nsatellite, in each case, which could be more or less, depending on the circumstances\u037e (2) the successful\noperation otherwise of Maxar\u2019s entire existing satellite constellation\u037e and (3) the successful execution of\nMaxar\u2019s strategy, including its growth strategy, across each of Maxar\u2019s three business lines. The October\n2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast was prepared by adjusting the July 2022 Base Case Forecast to reflect the\nassumptions described in the previous sentence. Maxar\u2019s management provided the October Satellite Loss\nCase Forecast to the Board of Directors at a meeting on October 12, 2022. Additionally, Maxar\u2019s management\nprovided a copy of the October Satellite Loss Case Forecast to J.P. Morgan for use in their preliminary\nfinancial analysis of Maxar that was presented to the Board of Directors at the October 12, 2022 meeting.\nAt a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors on October 26, 2022, in connection with a\nreview of Maxar\u2019s performance against the financial targets in the long-term strategic plan, Maxar\u2019s\nmanagement prepared and provided to the Board of Directors certain updates to the July 2022 Base Case\nForecast to (i) reflect, among other updates, Maxar\u2019s actual financial results for the period since the July 2022\nBase Case Forecast had been prepared, and (ii) incorporate management\u2019s projected results for the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2027 (such updated non-public, unaudited financial projections, which covered\nthe fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2027, the \u201cOctober 2022 Base Case\nForecast\u201d). A copy of the October 2022 Base Case Forecast was provided to Advent during the management\npresentation that took place in Colorado on October 28, 2022, following execution of a confidentiality\nagreement with Maxar, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Background of the\nMerger.\u201d\nAdditionally, in November 2022, Maxar\u2019s management made adjustments to its long-term strategic plan\nin order to incorporate the impact of, among other things, (i) the amendment to the EchoStar Contract, as\ndefined and described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Background of the Merger,\u201d and (ii)\nMaxar\u2019s November 3, 2022 acquisition of Wovenware.\nAt a meeting of the Board of Directors on November 23, 2022, in connection with the Board of Directors\u2019\nconsideration of the November 23 Proposal, as defined and described in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201c- Background of the Merger,\u201d Maxar\u2019s management provided to the Board of Directors (i) an\nupdated version of the October 2022 Base Case Forecast, incorporating the November 2022 changes to the\nlong-term strategic plan (such updated forecast, the \u201cNovember 2022 Base Case Forecast\u201d) and (ii) an\nupdated version of the October 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast, incorporating the November 2022 changes\nto the long-term strategic plan and including management\u2019s projections for the fiscal year ending December\n31, 2027 (such updated forecast, the \u201cNovember 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast,\u201d and, together with the\nJuly 2022 Base Case Forecast, the October 2022 Base Case Forecast, the October Satellite Loss Case\nForecast and the November 2022 Base Case Forecast, the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Each of the November\n2022 Base Case Forecast and the November 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast were provided to J.P. Morgan,\nand Maxar directed J.P. Morgan to use and rely on the November 2022 Base Case Forecast and the November\n2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast in connection with the financial analyses presented by J.P. Morgan to the\nBoard of Directors and J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion as discussed in \u201c- Opinion of J.P. Morgan\n51 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSecurities LLC,\u201d and such use and reliance was approved by the Board of Directors. Maxar provided certain\nfinancial information that was used to make the November 2022 adjustments to the October 2022 Base Case\nForecast to Advent, but did not provide Advent with the November 2022 Base Case Forecast, the October\nSatellite Loss Case Forecast or the November 2022 Satellite Loss Case Forecast.\nMaxar advised the recipients of the Company Projections that its internal financial forecasts are\nsubjective in many respects. The inclusion of the Company Projections or of this summary does not\nconstitute an admission or representation by Maxar, J.P. Morgan, or any other person that the information is\nmaterial, should not be regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, J.P. Morgan, Maxar or its\nmanagement, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of\nthe achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on\nas such. This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and\nreaders of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company Projections.\nThe Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were\nbased are subjective in many respects and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions\nattributable to the dynamics of Maxar\u2019s industry and based on actual experience and business\ndevelopments. The Company Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous\nassumptions with respect to Company performance, industry performance, general business, economic,\nregulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject\nto significant economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond Maxar\u2019s control. The Company\nProjections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and\nuncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements,\u201d that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and\nfor actual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, there can be no assurance\nthat the Company Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower\nthan projected, and the Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results\nand should not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such\ninformation by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Company Projections do not\ntake into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared,\nincluding the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the\npreparation of the Company Projections may have changed since the date the Company Projections were\nprepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional\nsignificant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be\nachieved.\nIn addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results\nafter the date the Company Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of\nMaxar, Advent or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any\nobligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Projections or the specific portions presented to\nreflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in\nthe event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error (except, in the case of Maxar, as\nrequired by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the\nCompany Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nFor the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held more than three months\nafter the Company Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting\ninformation, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Company\nProjections set forth below. The Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the\nhistorical financial statements and other information contained in Maxar\u2019s public filings with the SEC. Maxar\nurges all of its stockholders to review its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial\nresults. See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThe Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public\ndisclosure or toward compliance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d),\npublished guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither KPMG LLP\n(\u201cKPMG\u201d), Maxar\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has\nexamined, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to the Company Projections and, accordingly,\n52 \n(1) \n(2) \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nneither KPMG nor any other accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto. The KPMG report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Maxar\u2019s\nhistorical financial information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein\nand should not be read to do so.\nMaxar has not made and makes no representation to any Maxar stockholder or to Advent, Parent,\nMerger Sub or Preferred Equity Issuer in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Company\nProjections or regarding Maxar\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the\nCompany Projections or that the projected results will be achieved.\nJuly 2022 Base Case Forecast\nMaxar\u2019s management prepared the July 2022 Base Case Forecast with respect to Maxar\u2019s business, as a\nstandalone company, for the second half of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 through the fiscal year\nending December 31, 2026, except that unlevered free cash flow was calculated by J.P. Morgan solely using\nthe prospective financial information included in the July 2022 Base Case Forecast, which calculation was\nreviewed and approved by Maxar\u2019s management for J.P.
