However, we cannot predict the\nexact timing of completion of the Merger because we cannot guarantee when all required antitrust and other required\nregulatory approvals will be obtained, or if they will be obtained at all.\nU.S. Regulatory Clearances\nUnder the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger has expired or\nbeen terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day\nwaiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade\nCommission (which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer\nto as the \u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a\n\u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day\nwaiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request,\nunless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. GBT made\nthe filing required under the HSR Act on August 26, 2022, and we currently expect Parent to make the filing required\nunder the HSR Act by August 29, 2022, in which case the initial 30-day waiting period will be scheduled to expire at\n11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 28, 2022, unless otherwise extended.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary\nor desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of\nsubstantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take\nsuch action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could\ninclude seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.\nPrivate parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be\ncertain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Clearances\nThe Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approval (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed\nbetween the parties) in Germany (pursuant to the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen\nWettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen)). The parties made the required filings with the German Federal Cartel Office\n(Bundeskartellamt) on August 26, 2022. If, prior to the Effective Time, a merger control inquiry is initiated by a\ngovernmental entity in certain specified jurisdictions, the Merger will also be subject to (a) regulatory approval in\nsuch jurisdiction or (b) confirmation that the inquiry has ended (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between\nthe parties). In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory\nlaws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or\nrequiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. We\ncannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal.\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS"

            "Opinion of J.P. Morgan\nPursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as one of its financial advisors in connection\nwith the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Board on August 7, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such\ndate and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nGBT stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the GBT common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management\nof the Company relating to its business, which are referred to in this summary of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion as\nthe \u201cManagement Forecasts\u201d, and are described further in the section of this proxy statement below\nentitled \u201c-Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P.

Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition\nand future prospects and operations of the Company and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or\nappropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness (and\ndid not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification). J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was\nnot provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nthe Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying\non financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they\nwere reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by\nmanagement as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such\nanalyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on\nwhich they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the\nrepresentations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related\nagreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,\nregulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues.\nJ.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for\nthe consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated\nbenefits of the Merger.\nThe Management Projections were prepared by the Company\u2019s management. The Company does not publicly\ndisclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nanalysis of the proposed Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndisclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and\nmay be beyond the control of the Company\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general\neconomic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary\nsignificantly from those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other\nforward-looking statements, please refer to the section of this proxy statement below entitled \u201c-Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed\nno opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company or the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P.\nMorgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or\nemployees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the Merger Consideration in\nthe proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that\nof the Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the\nBoard in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board\nor management with respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on August 7, 2022 and contained in the presentation delivered to\nthe Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The summary below does not purport to be\na complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial\nanalyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to\nmore fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text\nof each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the\nCompany with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged\nto be analogous to the Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:\nSelected Companies\nApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nCrispr Therapeutics AG\nIntellia Therapeutics, Inc.\nAmicus Therapeutics, Inc.\nINSMED Inc.\nBiocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\nEditas Medicine, Inc.\nReata Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nMedian FV/2026E Revenue Multiple = 3.5x\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations\nand business that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, J.P. Morgan considered to be similar to those of the\nCompany. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfrom those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe selected companies differently than they would affect the Company.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated the multiple of the firm value (\u201cFV\u201d) for the Company and\nthe selected companies (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable net debt or net cash) to the analyst\nconsensus estimates for calendar year 2026 revenues for the applicable company (the \u201cFV/2026E Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2026E Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of\n1.1x to 5.2x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the calendar year\n2026 provided in the Management Forecasts. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the\nGBT common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $21.25 to $88.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to\nthe implied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.\nSelected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions with\nrespect to businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be similar to the Company\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based\non J.P. Morgan\u2019s experience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates. The following\ntransactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:\nAnnouncement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nJanuary 19, 2022\nZogenix, Inc.\nUCB S.A.\nSeptember 8. 2021\nKadmon Holdings, Inc.\nSanofi\nFebruary 1, 2021\nViela Bio, Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nAugust 31, 2020\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc.\nNestl\u00e9 S.A.\nMay 5, 2020\nPortola Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSeptember 30, 2019\nDova Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nSwedish Orphan Biovitrum AB\nSeptember 12, 2016\nRaptor Pharmaceutical Corp.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nJuly 21, 2016\nRelypsa Inc.\nGalenica Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nMarch 30, 2015\nHyperion Therapeutics Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nMedian FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple = 3.5x\nNone of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the selected transactions\nwere chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered\nsimilar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company\u2019s estimated forward revenue for the fourth\nyear following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the \u201cFV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple reference range for the\nCompany of 2.6x to 5.4x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the\ntwelve-month period ending September 30, 2026, $1.2 billion, which amount was provided by the management of the\nCompany. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT common stock (rounded to\nthe nearest $0.25) of approximately $44.25 to $83.75, which J.P. Morgan compared to the implied per share equity value\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of\ndetermining the fully diluted equity value per share for the GBT common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered\nfree cash flows that the Company is expected to generate from October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2042, including\nthe impact of certain net operating losses based upon the Management Forecasts. J.P. Morgan also calculated a\nrange of terminal values of the Company at the end of this period by applying perpetual growth rates ranging from\n(50.0%) to (30.0%) for Oxbryta, GBT601 and inclacumab, 5.0% for research assets and 2.0%\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfor corporate overhead and other unallocated expenses based on guidance provided by the Company\u2019s management,\nto estimates of the unlevered free cash flow of the Company during calendar year 2042 as set forth in the\nManagement Forecasts. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to\npresent values as of September 30, 2022 using a range of discount rates from 10.5% to 13.5%, which were chosen by\nJ.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the\nunlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by adding net cash as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, $351 million, which estimate was provided by the management of the Company. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values for the Company, which J.P. Morgan divided by the number of outstanding\nshares of GBT common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis and adjusted for the Company\u2019s assumed future\nequity raise of $200 million in gross proceeds in 2023, to derive a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT\ncommon stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $52.25 and $65.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to the\nimplied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.\nCertain Other Information. J.P. Morgan also reviewed the Company\u2019s 52 week historical trading and analyst price\ntargets, in each case as of August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of GBT\ncommon stock was perceived by J.P. Morgan to be affected by a potential transaction) which ranged from $22.30 to\n$40.26 and $31.00 to $102.00, respectively. J.P. Morgan noted that historical stock trading and analyst price targets\nanalyses are not valuation methodologies but were presented merely for informational purposes.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the\nforegoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of\nthe processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the\nCompany. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses\nor factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or\nnegative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses",

You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger\nAgreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all of the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are\ngoverned by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information\ncontained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(a) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (b) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (c) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by GBT, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in\nconnection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties\nhave been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between GBT, Parent\nand Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable\nto such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. GBT stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries\nunder the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or\nany descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of GBT, Parent or Merger Sub\nor any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely\non the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of GBT, Parent and\nMerger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential\ndisclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent\nmay be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex\nA, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual\ninformation regarding GBT, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,\nwarranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should\nread the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding GBT and our\nbusiness.
