            "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE SPECIAL MEETING\nDate, Time and Purpose of the Special Meeting\nThis proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of\ndirectors to be exercised at a special meeting to be held on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only\nmeeting format. To access the virtual special meeting via live webcast, stockholders should visit\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM. To log in to the virtual special meeting, you will be required to enter a\ncontrol number (included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive), which will\nallow you to participate in the virtual special meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of\nthe record date.\nAt the special meeting, holders of our common stock will be asked to act on the following matters:\nProposal 1:\nTo consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company\u037e\nProposal 2:\nTo consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nmerger\u037e and\nProposal 3:\nTo consider and vote on a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of\nsoliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger\nproposal.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special\nmeeting.\nA copy of the merger agreement is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully\nin its entirety.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are\nentitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each\nholder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of\ncommon stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there were 229,163,176 shares of our\ncommon stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Holders of our Series B preferred stock are entitled\nto receive notice of the special meeting but are not entitled to attend or vote at the special meeting, and no vote or proxy is\nbeing solicited from such holders.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast at least 50% of all the votes entitled to be\ncast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special\nmeeting via the special meeting website constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. A\nquorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the\npurposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the\nspecial meeting will be adjourned to a later date that is not more than 120 days after the original record date (subject to\nrestrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the\nParent Entities\u2019 written consent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was\noriginally scheduled).\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common\nstock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. Because the required vote for\nthe merger proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the\nnumber of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting (including\nby abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will\nhave the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\n24 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For\nthe purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special\nmeeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect\non the outcome of such proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the\noutcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\nAccordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must complete and return the\nenclosed proxy card, authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or attend the virtual\nspecial meeting via the special meeting website and vote during the live webcast.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately\n1,067,169 shares of common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.47% of the voting power of our common stock\nentitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the\nshares of common stock that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and\nin favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.\nVotes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of\nelection for the special meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock\nrepresented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy.\nHow to Authorize a Proxy\nHolders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following\nmethods:\nmark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail\u037e\nauthorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions\nincluded with your proxy card\u037e or\nattend the virtual special meeting via the special meeting website and vote during the live webcast.\nRegardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares\nof common stock as described above as promptly as possible.\nA broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee are represented at a\nmeeting, but the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial\nowner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal but has discretionary\nvoting power on other proposals at such meeting. If you own common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or\nother nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on your\nvoting instruction form that you may receive from your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, since brokers,\nfinancial advisors, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the\nproposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on\nhow to vote your shares, following the directions contained in your voting instruction form. If you have not received such\nvoting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, financial advisor,\nbank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your common stock through a\nbroker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a \u201clegal\nproxy,\u201d executed in your favor, from the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee (which may take several days).\nBecause the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes that our common stockholders are\nentitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the\nvirtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on\nhow to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. Because the approval of the\nadvisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes\ncast on such proposal, and because your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary\nauthority to vote on either proposal, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special\nmeeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect\non the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\n25 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProxies and Revocation\nIf you authorize a proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If\nno voting instructions are indicated when you authorize your proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted in\naccordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nYou may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the virtual special meeting, in any of three\nways:\nby delivering, prior to the date of the special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after the date\nof the proxy that is being revoked to our Corporate Secretary at Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc., 150 N.\nRiverside Plaza, Suite 4200, Chicago, Illinois 60606\u037e\nby delivering to our Corporate Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by\ntelephone or by Internet at a date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the same shares\nof common stock\u037e or\nby attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.\nAttendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If you own\nshares of common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, you may revoke or change previously\ngranted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee\nthat is the registered owner of the shares.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special\nmeeting.\nSolicitation of Proxies\nWe will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be\nsolicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, email or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees, for\nwhich they will not receive additional compensation. We have engaged Broadridge to assist in the solicitation of proxies\nfor a fee of approximately $106,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and we have agreed to\nindemnify Broadridge against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations\nholding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are beneficially owned by others, to send (or cause to\nbe sent) proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners, and we will reimburse such holders for their\nreasonable expenses in so doing.\nAdjournments\nOur bylaws permit the chair or co-chair of the special meeting, acting in his or her own discretion and without any action\nby our stockholders, to adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the special\nmeeting. In such case, the adjourned meeting may take place without further notice (other than by an announcement made\nat the special meeting) unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after the original record date or if, after the\nadjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be\ngiven to each stockholder of record entitled to notice of or to vote at the special meeting (subject to restrictions in the\nmerger agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities\u2019 written\nconsent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).\nPostponements\nAt any time prior to convening the special meeting, we may postpone the special meeting for any reason without the\napproval of our common stockholders (subject to restrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain\ncircumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities\u2019 written consent, be held on a date that is more than\n30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).\n26 \n"
