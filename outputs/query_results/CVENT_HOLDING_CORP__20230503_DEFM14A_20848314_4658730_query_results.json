The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the\nMerger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value\n$0.0001 per share, of the Company (\u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the\neffective time of the Merger, other than (a) Owned Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger\nAgreement), and (b) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), will be cancelled\nand converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $8.50, without interest thereon (the \u201cPer Share\nPrice\u201d). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Per Share Price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance\nwith, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or\nany affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March\n13, 2023 (the \u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial\nstatements and other business and financial information of the Company.

With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the\nCompany, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,\nthat they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of\nthe management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered\nthereby.

The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion\nwas approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nstockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any\nother matter.\n62TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft dated March 13, 2023 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the Company common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company\nrelating to its business, as approved for J.P. Morgan\u2019s use by the Special Committee\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with the Special Committee and certain members of the management of the\nCompany with respect to certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the\nCompany, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P.\nMorgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for\nindependently verifying) any such information or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct nor was\nit provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nthe Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying\non financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they\nwere reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by\nmanagement of the Company and the Special Committee as to the expected future results of operations and financial\ncondition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger\nAgreement, and that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof\nprovided to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company\nand Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects\nmaterial to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by\nadvisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,\nregulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without\nany adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock (other than shares of Cvent\ncommon stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger\nSub), in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly\nexercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or the Vista Stockholders) in\nthe proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the\nholders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, as to the Preferred Equity\nFinancing or the Preferred Commitment Letter, or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMerger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to\nany officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to\nthe Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock in the proposed Merger or with\nrespect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nJ.P. Morgan was not authorized by the Special Committee or otherwise to and did not solicit any expressions of\ninterest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of the Company or any other alternative\ntransaction.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that\nof the Special Committee and the Cvent Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the\nmany factors considered by the Special Committee in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be\nviewed as determinative of the views of the Special Committee, the Cvent Board or the Company\u2019s management with\nrespect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Special Committee on March 13, 2023, which was subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of March 14, 2023, and in the financial analyses presented to the\nSpecial Committee on March 13, 2023 in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary\nof the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion to the Special\nCommittee and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some\nof the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not\nintended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables\nmust be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering\nthe full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data\nfor selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the\nCompany. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were:\n\u2022\nDocuSign, Inc.\n\u2022\nNew Relic, Inc.\n\u2022\nFive9, Inc.\n\u2022\nPaycor HCM, Inc.\n\u2022\nFreshworks Inc.\n\u2022\nVertex, Inc.\n\u2022\nZeta Global Holdings Corp.\n\u2022\nSprinklr, Inc.\nThese companies were selected because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, were considered similar to the Company. However, certain of these companies\nmay have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve\ncomplex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the\ncompanies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they would affect the\nCompany.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the multiple of the firm value\n(the \u201cFV\u201d) (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable, net debt or net cash) to the analyst consensus\nestimates of calendar year 2023 and 2024 revenues for the applicable company (the \u201cFV/2023E Revenue Multiple\u201d and\n\u201cFV/2024E Revenue Multiple\u201d).\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis.\n \nCompany\nFV/2023E Revenue Multiple\nFV/2024E Revenue Multiple\nDocuSign, Inc.\n4.2x\n3.9x\nNew Relic, Inc.\n4.8x\n4.1x\nFive9, Inc.\n5.2x\n4.4x\nPaycor HCM, Inc.\n6.8x\n5.8x\nFreshworks Inc.\n5.8x\n4.9x\nVertex, Inc.\n5.2x\n4.6x\nZeta Global Holdings Corp.\n4.1x\n3.4x\nSprinklr, Inc.\n3.3x\n2.9x\nBased on the results of this analysis, J.P.

J.P.\nMorgan then applied such reference ranges to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for calendar years 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively, as set forth in the February Projections. These analyses indicated a range of firm values, which was then\nadjusted to take into account the Company\u2019s net debt of $106 million obtained from the Company\u2019s management,\ncalculated as of December 31, 2022 to derive ranges of implied per share equity value for the Company common stock\n(rounded to the nearest $0.10) of approximately $4.50 to $7.90 and $4.80 to $8.10 for 2023 and 2024, respectively. J.P.\nMorgan compared this to the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock.\nSelected Transaction Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses which J.P.\nMorgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nexperience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the target\ncompany's FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company's estimated revenue for the twelve months\nimmediately following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the \u201cFV/NTM Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nThe following transactions were selected by J.P.

However, the selected transactions\nwere chosen by J.P. Morgan because J.P. Morgan judged certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s analysis, to be similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations\nand judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and\nother factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.\nBased on the results of this analysis and J.P. Morgan\u2019s professional judgment and experience, J.P. Morgan selected a\nFV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 4.0x to 8.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied such\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for calendar year 2023 as set forth in the February Projections.\nThe analysis indicated a range of firm values, which was then adjusted to take into account the Company's net debt\nof $106 million obtained from the Company\u2019s management, calculated as of December 31, 2022, which further\nindicated a range of implied per share equity value for the Company common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of\napproximately $5.50 to $11.40, which J.P. Morgan compared to the Merger Consideration of $8.50 per share of the\nCompany common stock.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis, using the unlevered free cash flows (less stock-based\ncompensation) that the Company was forecasted to generate from December 31, 2022 through fiscal year 2028, as set\nforth in the February Projections, for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for the\nCompany common stock. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of the 6-\nyear period ending in 2028 by applying terminal growth rates ranging from 4.5% to 5.5%, which were determined\nbased on J.P. Morgan's professional judgment and experience, to estimates of terminal revenue for the Company at\nthe terminal year, based on the February Projections. J.P. Morgan then discounted such unlevered free cash flow\nestimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of December 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging\nfrom 11.0% to 12.0%, which range was chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost\nof capital of the Company. The present values of such unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal\nvalues were then adjusted for the Company\u2019s estimated net debt of $106 million obtained from the Company\nmanagement, calculated as of December 31, 2022 to derive implied equity values per share of the Company common\nstock on a fully diluted basis. This analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the Company\ncommon stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of $6.30 to $8.60, which J.P. Morgan compared to the Merger\nConsideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock.\n",
            "Opinion of Qatalyst Partners\nThe Company retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the Cvent Board in connection with a potential\ntransaction such as the Merger and to evaluate whether the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company\ncommon stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nMerger Agreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of\nParent), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation, its knowledge of the\nCompany\u2019s business and the industry in which the Company operates.

The opinion sets forth, among other things,\nthe assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review\nundertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the Cvent Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common\nstock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger\nAgreement by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to\nsuch holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any\nCompany stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner\naddress the price at which the shares of the Company common stock will trade at any time. The summary of\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion,\nwhich is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.\nFor purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March 13, 2023 (the\n\u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other\nbusiness and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the February Projections,\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich are described more fully in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Certain Financial\nProjections.\u201d Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and\nthe prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the\nhistorical market prices and trading activity for the Company common stock and compared the financial performance\nof the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company common stock with that of certain other selected\npublicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the\nextent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such\nother information and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy\nand completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or\ndiscussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to the February Projections, Qatalyst Partners was\nadvised by the Company\u2019s management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with the management\nand the Cvent Board, that the February Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance\nof the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that terms of the Draft Merger\nAgreement would not differ materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger would be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver\nor delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of\nthe proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse\neffect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Qatalyst\nPartners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of\nthe Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition,\nQatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company\nas to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology\nand products. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion committee in accordance\nwith its customary practice. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with\nrespect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of the\nCompany common stock will trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,\nand the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion\nmay affect Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume\nany obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion did not address the underlying\nbusiness decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any\nstrategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is limited to the fairness, from\na financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash,\nwithout interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by\nthe holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst\nPartners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of (a) the compensation to any of\nthe officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to\nsuch consideration or (b) any consideration to be received by the Vista Stockholders or any of their affiliates other\nthan the merger consideration of $8.50 per share of the Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to\nbe received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThe following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion\ndated March 13, 2023. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any\nportion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners\nutilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts\u2019 projections of the future financial performance of the\nCompany as of March 13, 2023 (the \u201cAnalyst Projections\u201d) and the February Projections. Some of the summaries of\nthe financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and\nin order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together\nwith the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative\ndescription of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of\npotential per-share present values for the Company common stock as of December 31, 2022 (which is the end of the\nCompany\u2019s most recent completed fiscal year and most recent balance sheet date) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n(a)\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of the Company, based\non the February Projections, for calendar year 2023 through calendar year 2027 (which implied present\nvalue was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 12.0% to 15.0%, based on an estimated\nweighted average cost of capital for the Company calculated using the capital asset pricing model and\ninputs based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment)\u037e\n(b)\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of the Company, calculated by\nmultiplying the estimated unlevered free cash flow of the Company in calendar year 2028 of\napproximately $476 million based on the February Projections, by a range of multiples of fully diluted\nenterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated unlevered free cash flow of 16.0x to 24.0x (which was\nchosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment), and discounted to present value using\nthe same range of discount rates used in item (a) above\u037e and\n(c)\nthe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of approximately $140 million as of December 31, 2022, as\nprovided by the Company\u2019s management\u037e and\n\u2022\nsubtracting:\n(a)\nthe principal amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding senior secured revolving credit facility of\napproximately $208 million as of December 31, 2022, as provided by the Company\u2019s management\u037e and\n(b)\nfees payable to customers of approximately $38 million, as provided by the Company\u2019s management\u037e\nand\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by the number of fully-diluted shares of the Company common stock\n(calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as of March 10, 2023, which takes into account the Options\nand RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts were provided by the Company\u2019s management,\nwith each of the above-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having\nalso been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each respective\napplicable period (approximately 4% annually through calendar year 2027) due to the estimated net effects\nof equity issuances and cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future\ndilution provided by the Company\u2019s management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common\nstock of approximately $7.09 to $11.25.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company\nwith publicly available information and public market multiples for selected companies, which were selected by\nQatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in\nsimilar lines of business to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have\nother relevant or similar characteristics.\nBased upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the selected companies as of March 13, 2023, and\nusing the closing trading prices as of March 13, 2023 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners\ncalculated, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus\nrevenue for calendar year 2023 (the \u201cCY2023E Revenue Multiples\u201d) for each of the selected companies.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe companies used in this comparison are listed below:\nSelected

Price, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E Revenue\nMultiple for the Company of 4.8x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E Revenue Multiples for the selected companies and the application of its\nprofessional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 4.0x to 6.5x and applied this\nrange to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue based on each of the February Projections and the\nAnalyst Projections. Based on the calculations in the immediately preceding sentence and the number of fully-diluted\nshares of the Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method) as of March 10, 2023, which\ntakes into account the Options and RSU awards as of March 10, 2023, all of which amounts were provided by the\nCompany\u2019s management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for the Company common stock of\napproximately $5.44 to $8.76 based on the February Projections and approximately $5.53 to $8.90 based on the\nAnalyst Projections.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected\ncompanies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control\nof the Company, such as the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s business and the industry in general, industry\ngrowth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the\nindustry or in the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the\narithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nQatalyst Partners reviewed and compared 55 selected public all-cash software transactions announced since 2011\nthat had an announced deal value of greater than $1 billion.\nFor each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the fully\ndiluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of the actual revenue from the last completed twelve-\nmonths of the target company (\u201cLTM Revenue Multiple\u201d), and (b) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the\ntarget company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of revenue over the next-twelve-\nmonths of the target company (\u201cNTM Revenue Multiple\u201d).\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThese transactions are listed below:\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nLTM \nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM \nRevenue\nMultiple\n04/11/2022\nSailpoint Technologies Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n15.7x\n13.3x\n06/06/2022\nAnaplan, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n16.0x\n12.8x\n10/12/2022\nKnowBe4, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n14.9x\n11.4x\n07/26/2021\nMedallia, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n13.0x\n10.8x\n09/18/2014\nConcur Technologies, Inc.\nSAP SE\n12.6x\n10.2x\n04/26/2021\nProofpoint, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n10.8x\n9.4x\n07/28/2016\nNetSuite Inc.\nOracle Corporation\n11.8x\n9.1x\n06/01/2016\nDemandware, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, Inc.\n11.2x\n8.9x\n08/08/2022\nAvalara, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n10.7x\n8.8x\n12/07/2021\nMimecast Limited\nPermira\n10.0x\n8.8x\n08/19/2021\nInovalon Holdings, Inc.\nNordic Capital\n10.0x\n8.8x\n12/03/2011\nSuccessFactors, Inc.\nSAP AG\n10.9x\n8.7x\n12/12/2022\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nThoma Bravo\n9.8x\n8.4x\n10/11/2022\nForgeRock, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n10.5x\n8.4x\n03/08/2021\nPluralsight, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n9.8x\n8.4x\n02/04/2019\nThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc.\nInvestor Group\n10.0x\n8.4x\n04/11/2022\nDatto, Inc.\nKaseya & Insight\n9.7x\n8.3x\n1/29/2018\nCallidus Software Inc.\nSAP AG\n9.8x\n8.3x\n12/21/2020\nRealPage, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n9.1x\n8.2x\n12/17/2017\nAconex Limited\nOracle Corporation\n9.4x\n8.1x\n08/03/2022\nPing Identity Corporation\nThoma Bravo\n8.9x\n8.0x\n09/28/2022\nB"
