Consequently, the analyses, as\ndescribed above, should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Duke Realty board of directors\nwith respect to the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Duke Realty board of\ndirectors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other\nprofessionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any\nholder of shares of Duke Realty common stock or shares of Prologis common stock as to how to vote or act\non any matter with respect to the mergers or related transactions or any other action with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did\nnot address any other aspect of the mergers or related transactions, including the relative merits of the\nmergers as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, the prices at which\nshares of Duke Realty common stock or shares of Prologis common stock would trade at any time, or any\ncompensation or compensation agreements arising from (or relating to) the mergers which benefit any officer,\ndirector or employee of Duke Realty, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of shares of Duke Realty common stock in the transaction.\nThe Duke Realty board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications,\nexperience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,\ninvestment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in\nsecurities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives\ntrading, and prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory\nservices. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or\nmanage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise\nstructure and effect transactions, for their own account or for the accounts of their customers, in debt or\nequity securities or loans of Duke Realty, Prologis, or any other company, or any currency or commodity,\nthat may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or any related derivative\ninstrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Duke Realty board of directors with\nfinancial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with the mergers, described in this section\nand attached to this statement as Annex C, and Duke Realty agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of\napproximately $96 million for its services, $10 million of which was payable upon the rendering of its opinion,\nand the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the mergers. Duke Realty has\nalso agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses, including reasonable fees of outside\ncounsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Duke\nRealty has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents\nand employees and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against\ncertain liabilities and expenses relating to or arising out of Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement.\nIn the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial\nadvisory and financing services to Duke Realty and have received approximately $5 million to $10 million in\nconnection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its\naffiliates have provided financing services to Prologis and have received approximately $1 million to $5\nmillion in connection with such services. As of the date of the opinion, affiliates of Morgan Stanley are\nlenders to each of Duke Realty and Prologis under their respective credit facilities. Morgan Stanley and its\naffiliates may seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Duke Realty and Prologis and their\nrespective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nCertain Prologis Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nAlthough Prologis periodically may issue limited financial guidance to investors, Prologis does not as a\nmatter of course make public long-term projections as to future revenues, net operating income, funds from\noperations, funds from operations, as adjusted, or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty\nof the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the mergers and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Prologis\u2019 management prepared and provided to the\n91 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nPrologis board in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement, and to its financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, including in connection with its financial\nanalyses described above under the section entitled \u201c- Opinion of Prologis\u2019 Financial Advisor,\u201d certain\nunaudited prospective financial information as set forth below, which we refer to as the \u201cPrologis\nmanagement forecasts.\u201d In preparing the Prologis management forecasts, Prologis\u2019 management considered\ninformation communicated by Duke Realty and certain synergies and other changes that Prologis\u2019\nmanagement projected to result from the mergers. The below summary of the Prologis management forecasts\nis included for the purpose of providing Prologis stockholders access to certain non-public information that\nwas furnished to the Prologis board, Goldman Sachs and Duke Realty in connection with the mergers and\nsuch information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence the voting\ndecision of any Prologis stockholder or Duke Realty shareholder.\nThe Prologis management forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for the preparation and presentation of financial\nprojections. The inclusion of the Prologis management forecasts should not be regarded as an indication\nthat such information is predictive of actual future events or results and such information should not be\nrelied upon as such, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue\nreliance on the Prologis management forecasts. The Prologis management forecasts included in this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Prologis\u2019 management.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information set forth below\nwas based on numerous variables and assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance\nand general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Prologis\u2019\nbusiness, Duke Realty\u2019s business and the business of the Combined Company on a pro forma basis giving\neffect to the mergers, including anticipated or possible synergies) that are inherently subjective and\nuncertain and are beyond the control of Prologis\u2019 management. Important factors that may affect actual\nresults and cause this unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved include, but are not\nlimited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Prologis\u2019 business, Duke Realty\u2019s business and the business of\nthe Combined Company on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers (including its ability to achieve\nstrategic goals, objectives and targets and to achieve operating synergies over applicable periods), industry\nperformance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in the sections entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d This unaudited\nprospective financial information also reflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at\nthe time they were prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual\nresults may differ materially from those contained in this unaudited prospective financial information.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Prologis\nstockholders and Duke Realty shareholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of both Prologis\nand Duke Realty for descriptions of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial\ncondition and capital resources, including in (i) \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations\u201d in Prologis\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2021 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which are incorporated\nby reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and (ii) in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Duke Realty\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2021 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which\nare incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nNone of Prologis, Duke Realty or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other\nrepresentatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from this unaudited\nprospective financial information.\nPROLOGIS UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE\nBELOW UNAUDITED PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES\nEXISTING AFTER THE DATE THIS UNAUDITED PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS\nGENERATED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY\nOR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR.\nSINCE THE UNAUDITED\n92 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION COVERS MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS\nNATURE BECOMES LESS PREDICTIVE WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE YEAR.\nPrologis and Duke Realty may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including AFFO, Excluding\nGains and Promotes and Unlevered Free Cash Flow using different methodologies. Consequently, the\nfinancial metrics presented in each company\u2019s prospective financial information disclosures and in the\nsections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the opinions of Prologis\u2019 financial advisor\nto Prologis and Duke Realty\u2019s financial advisor to Duke Realty may not be directly comparable to one\nanother. Further, these financial metrics are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d as set forth in Item 10(e) of\nRegulation S-K and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with\nGAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures or as an indication of Prologis\u2019, Duke Realty\u2019s or the\nCombined Company\u2019s performance. None of these non-GAAP measures represents cash generated from\noperating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and none are a measure of liquidity or an indicator\nof Prologis\u2019, Duke Realty\u2019s or the Combined Company\u2019s ability to make cash distributions. The below\nunaudited prospective financial information should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation\nof a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the below unaudited prospective financial\ninformation ) in connection with a proposed transaction like the mergers when the disclosure is included in a\ndocument like this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion or\nby the Prologis board in connection with its consideration of the mergers. Accordingly, Prologis has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nPrologis has not made and makes no representation to Duke Realty or any Prologis stockholder or Duke\nRealty shareholder, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the below unaudited prospective\nfinancial information or regarding the ultimate performance of Prologis, Duke Realty or the Combined\nCompany on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers compared to the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation or that the projected results will be achieved. In light of the foregoing factors and the\nuncertainties inherent in the unaudited prospective financial information, Prologis urges all Prologis\nstockholders and Duke Realty shareholders not to place undue reliance on such information and to review\nPrologis\u2019 most recent SEC filings for a description of Prologis\u2019 reported financial results.\nNeither KPMG LLP nor any other registered public accounting firm has compiled, examined or performed any\naudit or other procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial information contained herein,\nnor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.\nThe report of KPMG LLP contained in Prologis\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/\u200bprospectus, relates to the\nhistorical financial information of Prologis. It does not extend to the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information\ndoes not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the dates on which it was prepared.\nThe Prologis management forecasts were provided to the Prologis board and Prologis\u2019 financial advisor,\nGoldman Sachs, and standalone forecasts (other than unlevered free cash flow) were provided to Duke\nRealty.\nPrologis on a Standalone Basis\nThe following table presents a summary of the Prologis management forecasts relating to Prologis (on a\nstandalone basis) for the calendar years 2022 through 2026.\n93 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nYear Ending December 31,\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\nTotal Net Operating Income\n$4,835\n$5,534\n$5,512\n$6,142\n$ 6,915\nAFFO, Excluding Gains and Promotes\n$2,899\n$3,259\n$3,704\n$ 4,118\n$ 4,630\nAFFO, Excluding Gains and Promotes/Share\n$ 3.78\n$ 4.24\n$ 4.81\n$ 5.34\n$ 5.99\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n$ 477\n$2,018\n$1,490\n$1,790\n$ 2,419\nDividend/Share\n$ 3.16\n$ 3.54\n$ 3.96\n$ 4.44\n$ 4.97\nAFFO, Excluding Gains and Promotes as used by Prologis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated\nbeginning with consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and modified to: (i)\nexclude net promote income, real estate related depreciation and amortization expense, net gains or\nlosses on real estate transactions (e.g., development properties, land, and other investments in real\nestate), current income tax expense on dispositions, net unrealized foreign currency and derivative gains\nor losses, deferred income tax expense, current income tax expense on dispositions related to acquired\ntax liabilities, net gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, straight-lined rents and amortization\nof lease intangibles, amortization of debt premium, financing costs, and management contracts (net),\nstock compensation amortization expense, preferred stock repurchases, (ii) include property\nimprovements and turnover costs, and (iii) incorporate reconciling items related to noncontrolling\ninterests and Prologis\u2019 share of unconsolidated ventures.\nBased on projected weighted average diluted outstanding shares of stock.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow as used by Prologis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated beginning with\nconsolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and modified to: (i) exclude interest\nexpense, preferred stock dividends, distributions with respect to Prologis OP preferred units,\ndepreciation and amortization expense, net gains or losses on real estate transactions (e.g., development\nproperties, land, and other investments in real estate), net unrealized foreign currency and derivative\ngains or losses, deferred income tax expense, net gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt,\nstraight-lined rents and amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt premium, financing costs,\nand management contracts (net), other various non-cash items (ii) include property improvements and\nturnover costs, net deployment cash flows related to acquisitions, dispositions and development\nactivity, promote cash receipts that are not included in consolidated net earnings, and (iii) incorporate\nreconciling items related to noncontrolling interests and Prologis\u2019 share of unconsolidated ventures.\nDuke Realty on a Standalone Basis\nThe following table presents a summary of the Prologis management forecasts relating to Duke Realty (on a\nstandalone basis) for the calendar years 2022 through 2026.
