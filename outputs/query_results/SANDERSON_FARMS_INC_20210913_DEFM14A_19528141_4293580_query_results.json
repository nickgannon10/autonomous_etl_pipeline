            "Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors, in consultation with the legal advisors and financial advisors and the management team, evaluated the Merger Agreement,\nthe Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and unanimously (i) determined that it is fair to and in the best interests\nof Sanderson Farms and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) adopted the plan of merger set forth in this\nMerger Agreement, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iv) recommends the approval of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Sanderson Farms.\nIn the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board of Directors considered a number of positive factors relating to the Merger Agreement and\nthe Merger, each of which the Board of Directors believed supported its decision, including the following:\nPremium and Multiples. The Board of Directors considered the current and historical market prices of the common stock, including the market\nperformance of the common stock relative to those of other participants in Sanderson Farms\u2019 sector and general market indices, and the fact that the\nmerger consideration of $203.00 per share in cash represents a substantial premium to estimates of Sanderson Farms\u2019 unaffected stock price, including a\npremium of 30.3% to Sanderson Farms\u2019 stock price on June 19, 2021, the trading day immediately prior to the leak published in the Wall Street Journal, a\npremium of 22.8% to Sanderson Farms\u2019 30-day volume-weighted average stock price as of June 18, 2021 and a premium of 15.2% to Sanderson Farms\u2019 all-\ntime high stock price as of June 18, 2021.\nBest Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value / Thorough Process. The Board of Directors considered that the present value of the merger\nconsideration of $203.00 in cash per share was more favorable to Sanderson Farms\u2019 stockholders than the potential value that might result from other\nalternatives reasonably available to Sanderson Farms, including, but not limited to, special dividends or distributions, leveraged stock repurchases, an\nacquisition or a series of acquisitions, an asset sale or divestiture of a business segment of Sanderson Farms, and the continued operation of Sanderson\nFarms on a stand-alone basis in light of a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nThat positive macroeconomic and industry factors, including increased demand in the Company\u2019s products and the resurgence of the\npoultry industry post-Covid 19, as well as internal factors, such as Sanderson Farms\u2019 valuation and management\u2019s projections, suggested\nthat this would be an opportune time to explore a sale process and obtain maximum value for Sanderson Farms\u2019 stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nThat Sanderson Farms had conducted a lengthy and thorough process since the Board of Directors\u2019 decision to explore a strategic process\non March 30, 2021, involving outreach to 12 potential acquirers and inbound inquiries from 2 potential acquirers, of which 8 entered into\nnon-disclosure agreements with Sanderson Farms and received due diligence, 2 provided first round indications of interest, and one party\n\u2014 the Bidder Group \u2014 provided a final definitive proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nThat the Bidder Group stated the $203.00 in cash per share proposal represented the Bidder Group\u2019s best and final proposal following the\nBoard of Directors\u2019 rejection of the Bidder Group\u2019s first two proposed final proposals, offering, respectively, $200.00 per share and $202.00\nper share\u037e\n\u2022\nThat the fact that Sanderson Farms was exploring a strategic transaction was well publicized since the leak published in the Wall Street\nJournal (including through various subsequent news reports) and that Sanderson Farms and Centerview responded to third parties who\nexpressed interest in a possible transaction on an unsolicited basis and who they believed were reasonably capable of consummating a\ntransaction, by offering such third parties the opportunity to conduct due diligence and make a proposal, subject only to the requirement\nthat they enter into a customary non-disclosure agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nThat the Board of Directors had conducted extensive deliberations over a period of five months in connection with the strategic process, at\nboth regularly scheduled and special meetings attended by all members of the Board of Directors, to discuss updates regarding the strategic\nprocess.\n-35-Table of Contents\nOpinion of Centerview Partners LLC. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presentation of Centerview and the oral opinion of\nCenterview rendered to the Board of Directors on August 8, 2021, which were subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of\nsuch date and based upon and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and\nqualifications to the review undertaken, as set forth in Centerview\u2019s written opinion, the $203.00 per share in cash to be paid to the holders of shares of\ncommon stock in the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled \u201c\u2014\nOpinion of Centerview Partners LLC.\u201d\nGreater Certainty of Value.
