Factual disclosures about Tenneco contained in this proxy statement or in Tenneco\u2019s public\nfilings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), as described in \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d on page 160\nof this proxy statement, may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Tenneco contained in the Merger Agreement and in\nthis summary. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of\nthe Merger Agreement and as of specific dates and solely for the benefit of parties to the Merger Agreement, and:\n\u2022\nwere negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the\nright not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue, due to a change in\ncircumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as\nfacts\u037e\n\u2022\nhave been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made among the parties to the Merger Agreement in\nconnection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself\u037e\n\u2022\nmay no longer be true as of a given date\u037e\n\u2022\nmay be subject to a contractual standard of materiality in a way that is different from those generally applicable to you or other\nstockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC\u037e and\n\u2022\nmay be subject, in some cases, to other exceptions and qualifications, including exceptions that do not result in, and would not\nreasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, as defined in \u201c\u2014Representations and Warranties\u201d on page 78 of\nthis proxy statement.\nStockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants\nand agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Tenneco, Parent or Merger Sub or\nany of their respective affiliates or businesses. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations\non the respective businesses of Tenneco, Parent or Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly\npermitted in the confidential disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which\nconsent may be given without notice to the public. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties,\nwhich do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, and\nsubsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may not be included in this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other provisions of the Merger Agreement or any description of such provisions\nshould not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the\ndocuments incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, as well as the disclosures in Tenneco\u2019s periodic and current reports, proxy\nstatements and other documents filed with the SEC.

Tenneco\nshall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the paying agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to\nbe deposited, with the paying agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time. In\nthe event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the payments for the purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration,\nParent will promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the paying agent additional funds to ensure that the paying agent has sufficient\nfunds to make such payments.\nAs soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than the third business day following the Effective Time), the Surviving\nCorporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares\nrepresented by a stock certificate, or a holder of book-entry Shares, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal, together with instructions for effecting the surrender of the stock certificates (or\naffidavits of loss in lieu of the certificates) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.

Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the paying agent will not be liable to any holder of a stock\ncertificate or book-entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat\nor similar law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the paying agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have\nbeen perfected will be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand.\nIn the event that any stock certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the paying agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen\nor destroyed stock certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such stock certificate is lost, stolen or\ndestroyed, the Merger Consideration. Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger\nConsideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may\nreasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the paying\nagent with respect to the stock certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.\nCompletion of the Transaction\u037e Closing\nThe closing of the Merger will take place at 8:00 a.m. local time, on the third business day following satisfaction of all of the conditions to\nclosing (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at\nthe closing) or on such other date as is agreed to by Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub. However, if the Marketing Period (as defined below)\nhas not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing, then the closing will occur on the date following the\nsatisfaction of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (i) any business day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent\non no less than three business days\u2019 prior notice to Tenneco and (ii) three business days following the final day of the Marketing Period\n(subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver, if applicable of the closing conditions at the Effective Time).

            "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS\nIn January 2015, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Kesseler that was amended on October 1, 2018 which is described further below.\nIn October 2018, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Jueckstock that is described further below.\nIn October 2018, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Norton, including a letter communicating his transition to his new position in May\n2021, which is described further below.\nIn July 2020, we entered into offer letters with each of Messrs. Baird and Masanovich which are described further below.\nRetirement Plans\nWe offer to our U.S.-based salaried employees, including our U.S.-based named executive officers, customary, tax-qualified defined\ncontribution retirement (401(k)) plans. Beginning in 2007 (for Tenneco employees) and 2019 (for Federal-Mogul employees) the defined\ncontribution plans provide for a company match on employee contributions of 100% on the first 3% of an employee\u2019s pay and 50% on the\nnext 2% of an employee\u2019s pay, which we believe to be in line with prevailing practices for major U.S. corporations. In addition to this matching\ncontribution, we also provide a company contribution (called a \u201cCompany Retirement Contribution\u201d) which is a percentage of a participant\u2019s\ncompensation (between 2.5% and 4% for years beginning in 2021) that is determined based on the individual\u2019s age. Participants are eligible\nto receive Company Retirement Contributions after they have completed 12 months of service with the company.\nWe also maintain unfunded non-qualified defined contribution retirement plans (the \u201cExcess Benefit Plans\u201d). Our named executive officers and\nother senior managers are eligible to participate in an Excess Benefit Plan, with allocations under the plans generally calculated in the same\nmanner as under the applicable existing defined contribution retirement plans, except that (i) Company Retirement Contributions under the\nplans are made based on compensation that includes bonus compensation payable in accordance with the AIP formula (or other annual\nbonus formula in effect at the relevant time) and (ii) contributions under the plans are based on compensation in excess of the Section 401(a)\n(17) limitations of the Internal Revenue Code.\nTenneco Inc.\n133\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents\nUnder the terms of his offer, Mr. Kesseler was entitled to receive an Excess Benefit Plan contribution of 3% of compensation (including bonus\ncompensation) through December 31, 2019. Thereafter, Mr. Kesseler\u2019s benefit under the Excess Benefit Plan is to be determined in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the Excess Benefit Plan.\nFor U.S.-based executives we (and Federal-Mogul prior to the acquisition) previously offered defined benefit retirement plans that were\ncustomary for the automotive industry and, in the case of the Tenneco plans, were consistent with similar plans maintained by the\nconsolidated Tenneco Inc. prior to our becoming a stand-alone public company in 1999. These plans included:\n\u00b7\na customary tax-qualified retirement plan that was generally available to all U.S.-based salaried employees (see \u201c\u2014 Post-Employment\nCompensation\u201d)\u037e and\n\u00b7\na supplemental executive retirement plan for Tenneco executives for periods prior to January 1, 2007, which we call the \u201cSRP\u201d (see \u201c\u2014\nPost-Employment Compensation \u2014Supplemental Retirement Plan\u201d).\nAlthough benefits under both the qualified defined benefit plans and the SRP were frozen, prior earned benefits under the plans were\npreserved.\nMr. Jueckstock, a native of Germany, participates in a defined benefit schedule of the Federal-Mogul German Pension Plan in lieu of the U.S.\ndefined contribution plan. The company makes contributions not to exceed 125,000 Euros per year to the Federal-Mogul German Pension\nPlan on his behalf pursuant to his offer letter.\nPerquisites\nAs part of our competitive compensation plan, the NEOs are eligible for limited perquisites provided by or paid for by the company. We offer\nthe NEOs and certain eligible executives an executive annual physical, which some chose to utilize in 2021. Perquisites provided are\nreviewed on a regular basis. For each named executive officer, the aggregate value of any such perquisites to each such executive was less\nthan $10,000.\nSeverance Benefits\nWe have agreed to pay our Chief Executive Officer two times his then-current salary and two times target bonus for the year in which\ntermination occurs if we terminate his employment other than for disability, cause or in connection with a change in control. We view these\nbenefits as customary and a key element of the recruiting and retention of executives in light of company and industry specific factors.\nWe maintain a Severance Benefit Plan that applies to all U.S. salaried, full-time employees with at least three months of service who are\nterminated by us without cause or in connection with a reduction in force or similar layoff. The benefits payable under this plan are described\nunder \u201c\u2014 Other Potential Post-Employment Compensation \u2014 Severance Benefits.\u201d We most recently amended the plan in April 2020 to\nreflect prevailing market practices.\nChange in Control\nWe maintain a Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives (the \u201cCIC Executive Severance Plan\u201d) to enable us to retain and\nmotivate highly qualified employees by eliminating, to the maximum practicable extent, any concern that their job security or benefit\nentitlements will be jeopardized by a \u201cchange in control\u201d of our company.\nAs of year-end, our plan applied to thirteen members of management. The CIC Executive Severance Plan generally provides for cash benefits\nconsisting primarily of a multiple (two or three times) of an officer\u2019s annual salary and annual targeted cash incentive if the executive officer is\nactually terminated (other than for cause, death or disability) or constructively terminated on or within two years following a change in control.\nSee \u201cPost-Employment Compensation \u2014 Other Potential Post-Employment Compensation \u2014 Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for\nKey Executives.\u201d We amended and restated our CIC Executive Severance Plan in November 2020 to reflect current market practices and to\nconform the provisions to certain other plans that we maintain, including updating the definition of change in\n134\nTable of Contents\ncontrol thereunder and eliminating the parachute tax gross-up provisions which have not applied to any of our executives for several years. Mr.\nKesseler\u2019s cash payment in connection with a change in control termination will equal three times the total of his then current base salary\nplus his targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control. The cash payment in connection with a change in control\ntermination for each of Messrs. Masanovich, Baird, Jueckstock and Norton will equal two times the total of his then current base salary plus\nhis targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control.\nIn addition, the terms of our 2006 LTIP (and our prior long-term incentive plans), provided for awards to vest upon a change in control, unless\nthe committee otherwise provides in an award agreement. Effective for grants of awards made on or after November 5, 2020, including for\ngrants made under the current long-term incentive plan, we amended the 2021 LTIP to eliminate the single trigger vesting. For a more detailed\ndescription of the treatment of awards upon a change in control see \u201cPost-Employment Compensation \u2014 Other Potential Post-Employment\nCompensation \u2014 Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives.\u201d\nEQUITY AWARD POLICY",
            "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nTenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are\nnecessary, proper or advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable law to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate and\nmake effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable. These approvals\ninclude the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as\namended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) and clearance of the Merger having been granted by relevant antitrust and foreign direct investment authorities in\ncertain other jurisdictions.\nIn addition, each of Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (1) cooperate reasonably with each other\nin connection with regulatory filings or submissions in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any\ninvestigation or other inquiry by a governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e (2)\npromptly inform the other parties of material communications received from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the\nDepartment of Justice or any other similar governmental entity (foreign or domestic)\u037e (3) consult with each other prior to taking any material\nposition with respect to the regulatory filings or submissions\u037e (4) permit the other parties\u2019 legal counsel to review and discuss in advance any\nanalyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any governmental entity with respect to\nregulatory approvals\u037e and (5) coordinate with the other parties\u2019 legal counsel in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly\nprovide the other parties\u2019 legal counsel with copies of all filings, presentations or material submissions made by such party with any\ngovernmental entity with respect to regulatory approvals. Parent will, with prior notice to and consultation of Tenneco, and taking Tenneco\u2019s\nviews into account in good faith, control and lead all communications and strategy on behalf of the parties relating to regulatory approvals.\nIf and to the extent necessary to obtain any regulatory approval required for the closing of the Merger or to avoid the entry of or have lifted or\nterminated any order restraining or enjoining the Merger, Parent will (1) propose, negotiate\n70Table of Contents\nand offer to commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale or other disposition of any assets or\nbusinesses of Tenneco or its subsidiaries\u037e (B) behavioral limitations on the assets or businesses of Tenneco or its subsidiaries\u037e and (C) the\ntermination, modification, transfer or other action with respect to any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of Tenneco\nor its subsidiaries\u037e (2) otherwise offer to take action that it is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take such action, that limits or\naffects its freedom of action\u037e and (3) in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably\nforeseeable to be entered that would make consummation of the Merger unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the Merger,\nany and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent is not required to\ntake any of the foregoing actions to the extent such actions would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the\naggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after\ngiving effect to the Merger.\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), the Merger cannot be completed\nuntil Tenneco and Parent each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the\n\u201cDOJ\u201d) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period thereunder has expired or been terminated. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub\nsubmitted a notification to the FTC on March 8, 2022, and the applicable waiting period expired on April 7, 2022. Accordingly, the transaction\nhas been cleared by the FTC.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR\nAct, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including\nseeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or\nhold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and\nnotwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust\nlaws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or\nseeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under\ncertain circumstances.\nForeign Competition Laws\nEuropean Union. Both Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, conduct business across the European Union in multiple member\nstates. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,\nwhich we refer to as the \u201cEU Merger Regulation\u201d, mergers and acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and individual European\nUnion sales exceeding specified thresholds must be notified to, reviewed and approved by the European Commission before they are\nimplemented. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, meet the thresholds set out in the EU Merger Regulation and are therefore\nobligated to (i) notify the transaction to the European Commission of and (ii) wait to implement the merger until after the European\nCommission has issued a decision declaring the merger compatible with the common market. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub submitted a\ndraft filing to the European Commission on March 28, 2022 and intend to file a formal notification to the European Commission as soon as is\nreasonably practicable.\nCanada. In addition, under the Competition Act of Canada, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue thresholds cannot\nbe consummated until they are filed, reviewed and approved by the Competition Bureau of Canada.

Tenneco currently expects to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022.

This will be\ntreated as ordinary compensation income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and subject to income and other payroll tax withholding.\nCompany RSUs and Company PSUs that are forfeited prior to closing (pursuant to termination of employment or otherwise) will not be\nentitled to any consideration at the close of the Merger.\nIf you previously received Tenneco class A common stock in settlement of Company RSUs or Company PSUs and already recognized\nordinary income on such Tenneco class A common stock at the time of such settlement, then you will generally recognize a capital gain or\nloss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the income you previously recognized and the amount paid for the\nstock in the Merger. The capital gain or loss will be long-term if more than one year has expired between the time you recognized the income\nand the Merger. Holders of such Tenneco class A common stock received in settlement of Company RSUs or Company PSUs generally will\nnot be subject to income or other payroll tax withholding on any such capital gain.\nWhat effect will the Merger have on Tenneco and its common stock?\nTenneco\u2019s class A common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cTEN\u201d.

Tenneco\nstockholders will cease to have any equity interest in Tenneco and will have no right to participate in its earnings and future growth.\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to the named executive officers of Tenneco in connection with the Merger?\nSection 14A of the Exchange Act requires Tenneco to conduct a non-binding advisory vote with respect to certain \u201cgolden parachute\u201d\ncompensation that may be paid or become payable to Tenneco\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the\nagreements and understandings with Tenneco pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable.\nTenneco Inc.\n19\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal at the annual\nmeeting?\nApproval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.

Further, the underlying compensation plans and\nagreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nHow does Tenneco\u2019s Board of Directors recommend that I vote on the proposals?\nAfter consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and after reviewing and considering the terms and conditions of the\nMerger and the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Tenneco and its\nstockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco for adoption, and (iv) recommended that the\nTenneco stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nAccordingly, Tenneco\u2019s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote:\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger (Item 1)\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named\nexecutive officers of Tenneco in connection with the Merger (Item 2)\u037e and\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional votes to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and approve the Merger if there are insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (Item\n3).\nTo review the Board\u2019s reasons for recommending the Merger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of Our Board of\nDirectors and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 41 of this proxy statement.\nIn addition, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote:\n\u2022\nFOR the election of all nominees for election as director described in this proxy statement (Item 4)\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent",

Agreement.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nReasons for the Merger\nAt a meeting of our Board on February 22, 2022, our Board (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared\nadvisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be\nsubmitted to the stockholders of Tenneco for adoption and (iv) recommended that Tenneco\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIn reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by\nTenneco\u2019s stockholders, the Board evaluated the Merger Agreement and the Merger with Tenneco\u2019s executive management and Tenneco\u2019s\nfinancial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors (which are not intended to be\nexhaustive or listed in any relative order of importance):\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium of 100.4% to Tenneco\u2019s closing stock price on February 22, 2022, the last\ntrading day before the Merger Agreement was announced, and a premium of 71.6% over the 90-day volume-weighted average on the\nsame date\u037e\n\u2022\nuncertainties associated with the long-term risks and challenges in continuing to implement Tenneco\u2019s strategic plan, including strategic\nbusiness and execution risks in light of the transformational changes and realignments expected in the automotive industry resulting from\nthe growing adoption of battery electric vehicles\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the value offered to stockholders pursuant to the Merger is more favorable to Tenneco\u2019s stockholders than the\npotential value from other alternatives reasonably available to Tenneco, including remaining an independent public company and the sale\nor other disposition of DRiV and/or our Powertrain, Systems Protection, Clean Air or other business units, after reviewing Tenneco\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, market trends, competitive landscape and execution risks, and discussions with\nTenneco\u2019s management and advisors and considering:\n\u2022\nincreased volatility and uncertain outlook in the automotive industry driven by:\nincreasingly rapid adoption of battery electric vehicles, particularly in Tenneco\u2019s most important markets, and the resulting impact\non the market for internal combustion engines\u037e\nsupply chain issues and the ongoing global semiconductor shortage\u037e\nthe emergence of increased inflation as a possible risk to light vehicle demand and production\u037e\nhigh fixed costs\u037e\nTenneco Inc.\n41\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents\ntiming and uncertainty as to the strength of the macroeconomic recovery from COVID-related supply chain disruption\u037e and\nincreasing material commodity and freight costs\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential for Tenneco\u2019s high financial leverage relative to its peers to exacerbate the effect of negative industry factors and make\nit more difficult for Tenneco to make the necessary investments to react to such factors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe impact of increasing multiple compression on the valuations of auto supplier with higher powertrain content\u037e\n\u2022\nthe continued cyclicality of the automotive industry\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant amount of Tenneco\u2019s debt that would likely need to be refinanced in the near- to medium-term\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration of $20.00 per share will be paid in cash, and provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to\nTenneco\u2019s stockholders, enabling them to realize value for their interest in Tenneco while eliminating business and execution risk inherent\nin Tenneco\u2019s business, including risks and uncertainties associated with achievement of the stand-alone plan\u037e\n\u2022\nTenneco\u2019s review of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value dating back to 2019, including our exploration of a potential spin-\noff of DRiV, our public announcement of ongoing review of strategic alternatives in January 2020, and our outreach to, and extensive\ndiscussions with, potentially interested parties regarding a sale or other disposition of our Powertrain, Systems Protection, Clean Air or\nother business units (as further described in the section titled \u201c\u2014 Background of the Merger\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to respond to and negotiate an alternative acquisition proposal from a third party if such proposal is determined to constitute or\nwould be reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal\u037e the Board\u2019s ability to change its recommendation in accordance with the\ncustomary fiduciary out provisions\u037e and our ability to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal with the payment of a\ncustomary termination fee, which termination fee amount the Board believes to be reasonable under the circumstances given the size of\nthe transaction, our leverage position and taking into account the range of such termination fees in similar transactions and believes will\nnot preclude or substantially impede a possible competing proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief of the Board, based upon arm\u2019s length negotiations, including Parent\u2019s increase in its proposed price per share to $20.00 (as\nfurther described in the section titled \u201c\u2014 Background of the Merger\u201d), that the price to be paid by Parent was the highest price per share\nthat Parent was willing to pay for Tenneco\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm\u2019s length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that were, in the\nBoard\u2019s view, advisable and favorable to Tenneco and its stockholders, as well as the Board\u2019s belief, based on these negotiations, that\nthese were the most favorable terms available to Tenneco and its stockholders on which Parent was willing to transact\u037e\n\u2022\nthe business reputation and capabilities of the Apollo Funds and their ability to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief that Parent has access to the resources needed to complete the Merger, based on, among other factors, that Parent\nhas obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable financial institutions and committed equity financing from the\nSponsors (as defined below), and that Parent had agreed to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the debt financing and the equity\nfinancing in accordance with their respective terms\u037e\n\u2022\nthe financial presentation and oral opinion delivered by Lazard to the Board on February 22, 2022, which was confirmed by delivery of a\nwritten opinion, dated February 22, 2022, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions\nset forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to Tenneco\u2019s stockholders (other than with respect to shares of Tenneco\u2019s class A\ncommon stock held by holders who are entitled to, and have properly demanded, an appraisal of their shares and shares held by Tenneco\nas treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Merger Sub)) in the\nMerger was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. The Lazard opinion is more fully described\n42\nTable of Contents\nin \u201c\u2014"
