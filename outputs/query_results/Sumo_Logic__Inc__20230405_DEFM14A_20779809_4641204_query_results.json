The merger agreement\nalso provides that Sumo Logic, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may specifically\nenforce the obligations under the merger agreement, except that Sumo Logic may only cause Parent and Merger Sub\nto consummate the merger, and Parent to cause the equity financing to be funded pursuant to the equity commitment\nletter, if certain conditions are satisfied.\nSubject to limited exceptions, Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s aggregate liability for monetary damages for breaches of the\nMerger Agreement are capped at $104.0 million, plus certain reimbursement obligations, and Sumo Logic\u2019s liability for\nmonetary damages for breaches of the Merger Agreement is capped at $52.0 million, plus any enforcement expenses.\nSumo Logic\u2019s receipt of certain reimbursement obligations payable by Parent to the extent owed, Sumo Logic\u2019s right\nto enforce the equity commitment letter with respect thereto and receive certain other amounts under the merger\nagreement, and Sumo Logic\u2019s right to specific performance are the sole and exclusive remedies of Sumo Logic and its\naffiliates against Parent and its affiliates in respect of the merger agreement, the related transaction documents, the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement or such transaction documents, the termination of the merger\nagreement or the failure to consummate the merger or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any\nsuch breach, termination or failure, and, upon payment of the reimbursement obligations, neither Parent nor any of its\naffiliates will have any further liability or obligation to Sumo Logic or any of its affiliates relating to or arising out of\nthe merger agreement, the related transaction documents, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or\nsuch transaction documents or for any matters forming the basis of such termination, other than in the case of\nintentional common law fraud or a willful breach of the merger agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,\nunder no circumstances can Sumo Logic receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to\ncause the equity financing to be funded (whether under the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter) and\nthe occurrence of the closing, on the one hand, and (1) payment of any monetary damages (including any monetary\ndamages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever\u037e or (2) payment of any of the reimbursement obligations by\nParent to Sumo Logic, on the other hand.",

Therefore, the Company Termination Fee, if, as and\nwhen required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages\nin a reasonable amount that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is\npayable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement\nand in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.\n(d) Payments\u037e Default.

            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger\nagreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger\nagreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not\ncontain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the\nparties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other\ninformation contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations, and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from\nthose generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by\nconfidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Sumo Logic in connection with the merger agreement.\nIn addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of\nallocating contractual risk between Sumo Logic and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as\nfacts. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.\nSumo Logic\u2019s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not\nrely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations\nof the actual state of facts or condition of Sumo Logic, Parent, or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the date of the merger agreement. Except where expressly provided in the merger agreement, none of the\nrepresentations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect\nunder the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants\nin the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub\nbecause the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter\nto the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given\nwithout prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to\nprovide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual\ninformation regarding Sumo Logic, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants, and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone,\nand you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in Sumo Logic\u2019s filings with the SEC\nregarding Sumo Logic and Sumo Logic\u2019s business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub, and Sumo Logic that is no\nlater than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last condition to the closing of the merger\n(other than those conditions that by their term are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the\nsatisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement) of such conditions)\u037e or (2) at such other\ntime agreed to by Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will file a\ncertificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will\nbecome effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a later time agreed to in writing by\nthe parties and specified in such certificate of merger.",
