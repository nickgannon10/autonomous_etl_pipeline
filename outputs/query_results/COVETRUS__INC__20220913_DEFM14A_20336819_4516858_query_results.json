            "The Merger Agreement\n(see page 82)\nA summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and which is incorporated by\nreference in this proxy statement, is described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d Among other things, the\nMerger Agreement includes the following terms:\n\u2022\nEffective Time of the Merger\u037e Closing. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s stockholders, we anticipate that the Merger will be\ncompleted in the second half of 2022. The Company, however, cannot assure completion of the Merger by any particular date, if at all.\n\u2022\nConditions to the Merger. The closing of the Merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or waived (other than the\ncondition set forth in the first bullet below, which cannot be waived). These conditions, which are described more fully in \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Conditions to the Merger,\u201d include:\n\u2022\nThe respective obligations of the parties to the Merger Agreement to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction (or mutual\nwaiver as of the closing by each of Parent and Covetrus where permitted under applicable law) of the following conditions: (i)\nadoption of the Merger Agreement by Company\u2019s stockholders in accordance with applicable law and the Company\u2019s certificate\nof incorporation and bylaws\u037e (ii) the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act having\nexpired or been earlier terminated (the HSR Act waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. EST on July 8, 2022) and the other filings,\nnotices, reports, consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods, clearances or authorizations set forth\nin the disclosure letter delivered by Covetrus in connection with the Merger Agreement having been filed, occurred or obtained,\nas applicable\u037e and (iii) no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered\nany law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the\nconsummation of the Merger.\n\u2022\nThe obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent as of\nthe closing of additional conditions, including: (i) subject to materiality qualifiers in certain cases, the accuracy of each of our\nrepresentations and warranties\n2Table of Contents\nin the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) Covetrus\u2019 performance and compliance with in all material respects all obligations required to be\nperformed by or complied with by us under the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger\u037e (iii) since the date of the\nMerger Agreement, there not having occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Representations and Warranties of Covetrus\u201d)\u037e and (iv) the receipt by Parent of a signed certificate by a\nsenior executive officer of Covetrus at the closing of the Merger stating that the foregoing conditions have been satisfied.\n\u2022\nCovetrus\u2019 obligations to complete the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by us as of the closing of the Merger\nof additional conditions, including: (i) subject to certain materiality qualifiers, the accuracy of each of the representations and\nwarranties of Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) each of Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s performance and\ncompliance with in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by or complied with by it under the Merger\nAgreement as of the closing of the Merger\u037e and (iii) the receipt by the Company of a signed certificate by an officer of Parent to\nthe effect that the forgoing conditions have been satisfied.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals. The Merger Agreement provides that we are not permitted to, among other things, directly or\nindirectly through our representatives solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any\nproposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals\u2014No Solicitation or Negotiation\u201d).\n\u2022\nBoard Recommendation Changes. Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, under certain circumstances, we may, prior to the\ntime the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders, (x) provide non-public information in response to an unsolicited, bona fide\nwritten Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, subject to\ncertain conditions, and (y) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with certain third parties who have made such a\nbona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only if the Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) has\ndetermined in good faith and after consultation with outside legal counsel that, based on the information then available and after\nconsultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either\nconstitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals\u2014Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision\u201d), and\nthe failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\napplicable law.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that, at any time before the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement, the\nBoard (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) may effect a change in recommendation (or terminate the Merger\nAgreement) with respect to (x) an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal if the Board (acting on the recommendation of the\nTransaction Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such\nAcquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) certain material effects not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by (or if\nknown or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by) the Board prior\nto the execution of the Merger Agreement and, in each case, the Company complies with certain procedures. The non-solicitation\nprovisions are described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Restriction on\nSolicitation of Competing Proposals.\u201d\n3\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nTermination and Termination Fees. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including, among other things, the right\nof any party to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not occurred on or before November 24, 2022 (subject under certain\ncircumstances to an automatic extension of three months pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement) and the right of the Company\nto terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal, subject to specified exceptions and limitations, and provides that:\n\u2022\nupon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or Parent in certain circumstances, including a termination by Parent\nas a result of a change in the recommendation of the Board or a termination by the Company to enter into an Alternative\nAcquisition Agreement (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Restriction on Solicitation of Competing\nProposals\u2014No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement\u201d) providing for a Superior Proposal, or, if the\nMerger Agreement is terminated and the Company enters into or completes an alternative transaction within 12 months, subject\nto certain additional conditions having been met, the Company will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $88,315,000\u037e and\n\u2022\nupon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or Parent in certain circumstances, including a termination by the\nCompany as a result of (1) certain material breaches by Parent or Merger Sub of their representations, warranties, covenants or\nagreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, or (2) the failure of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the closing in a\nspecified timeframe when the conditions to Parent\u2019s obligation to close the Merger have been and remain satisfied or waived, the\nCompany has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent and Merger Sub that it is prepared to and stands ready, willing and able\nto consummate the closing and that all of the conditions to the Company\u2019s obligation to close the Merger have been satisfied or\nirrevocably waived, Parent will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $197,950,000.\nFor further discussion of the rights of the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement and the circumstances in which certain termination fees will be\npayable, see the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination\nFees.\u201d",

For Benjamin Wolin, such period commences three months\nprior to and ends 24 months following the consummation of the change in control. For Dustin Finer, Georgina Wraight, Matthew Malenfant and Matthew\nFoulston, such period commences two months prior (or the earlier date of execution of a definitive agreement to effectuate a change in control) and ends\n12 months following the consummation of the change in control.\nFor each named executive officer, assuming their employment was terminated as a Qualifying Termination, the total severance payments would be as\nfollows: (i) for Benjamin Wolin, a lump sum payment equal to eighteen (18) months of base salary in the amount of $1,575,000 plus his target pro-rated\nannual bonus for 2022 in the amount of $656,250 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $45,980\u037e (ii) for Matthew\nFoulston, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $600,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 payable in equal installments\nover the twelve (12) month\n70\nTable of Contents\nperiod following the termination in the amount of $540,000 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $32,667\u037e (iii) for\nMatthew Malenfant, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $575,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 payable in equal\ninstallments over the twelve (12) month period following the termination in the amount of $460,000 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance\ncoverage in the amount of $47,108\u037e (iv) for Georgina Wraight, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $550,000 plus her target\nannual bonus for 2022 payable in equal installments over the twelve (12) month period following the termination in the amount of $412,500 and twelve (12)\nmonths of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $31,813\u037e and (v) for Dustin Finer, a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of base salary\nin the amount of $480,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 in the amount of $360,000 and twelve (12) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the\namount of $31,813.\nIn addition, upon a Qualifying Termination, all equity awards held by the executive officers that are subject to time-based vesting would become fully\nvested, and any equity awards that are subject to performance-based vesting will vest based on the \u201ctarget\u201d level of performance (for Benjamin Wolin) or\nbased on the greater of \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d performance at the time of termination (for Georgina Wraight, Matthew Foulston, Matthew Malenfant and\nDustin Finer) in accordance with the relevant award agreements.\nOn August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the \u201cFoulston Amendment\u201d) to Mr. Foulston\u2019s employment agreement, dated as of May 11,\n2020, in order to retain Mr. Foulston\u2019s services through December 31, 2022 (the \u201cExpiration Date\u201d). The Foulston Amendment provides for, among other\nterms: (i) the vesting of outstanding equity grants held by Mr. Foulston on the earlier of the Expiration Date and the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) the payment of Mr. Foulston\u2019s annual bonus at an amount equal to the greater of Mr. Foulston\u2019s 2022 target\nbonus and the amount earned based on the actual achievement of performance goals under the Company\u2019s 2022 annual bonus plan\u037e (iii) severance of\n$2,020,000 paid over twelve months following the Expiration Date\u037e (iv) eighteen-months COBRA continuation\u037e and (v) the payment of his base salary\nthrough the Expiration Date if his employment is terminated prior to the Expiration Date. In the event that Mr. Foulston\u2019s employment is terminated prior\nto the Expiration Date, either by the Company without \u201ccause,\u201d by Mr. Foulston for \u201cgood reason\u201d or by reason of death or \u201cdisability\u201d (each as defined\nin the Foulston Amendment), Mr. Foulston will continue to be entitled to the payments and benefits described above, as well as payment of his base\nsalary and provision of health benefits through the Expiration Date.\nOn June 23, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to Mr. Finer\u2019s employment agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, in order to clarify that\nMr. Finer will continue to be an employee of the Company on unpaid leave from August 16, 2022 through the earlier of the consummation of the Merger\nand December 31, 2022 (at which time his employment will terminate) and that Mr. Finer, will be entitled to receive certain benefits upon the consummation\nof the Merger, including the vesting of all vested and unvested outstanding equity grants.\nNew Management Arrangements\nIt is expected that the Company",
            "Intent to Vote in Favor of the Merger\nOur directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the shares of Company\ncommon stock owned directly by them in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Merger-Related Compensation\nProposal. As of September 7, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 872,688\nshares of Company common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, or collectively approximately 0.6% of all the outstanding shares of Company\ncommon stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification and Insurance\nThe Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and\nhold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, determined as of the Effective Time (the\n\u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) against any and all costs (including settlement costs) or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines, losses,\nclaims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,\nadministrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger Agreement\nand the Transactions)), arising out of or based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or\nis or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person prior to the Effective Time, in each case,\nwhether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company\nwould have been permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such person is a party, the\nCompany\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement to indemnify such person (and Parent and the Surviving\nCorporation will also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law\u037e provided that the person to whom expenses are\nadvanced will provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to\nindemnification). Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries, will, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable, in the aggregate, with respect to\nindemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational and governing documents\nof any subsidiary). The right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to the Merger Agreement will not be amended, repealed or otherwise\nmodified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party.\nPrior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to,\nobtain and fully pay for \u201ctail\u201d insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier\nwith the same or better credit rating as the Company\u2019s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and fiduciary\nliability insurance (collectively, \u201cD&O Insurance\u201d) with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing policies with\nrespect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions)\u037e\nprovided, however that in no event will the Company be required to expend for such policies an annual premium in excess of three- hundred percent\n(300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such \u201ctail\u201d insurance\npolicies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a\nperiod of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement with benefits and\nlevels of coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company\u2019s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or the\nSurviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period\n73Table of Contents\nwith benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company\u2019s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nprovided, however that in no event will the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual\npremium amount in excess of three- hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance\u037e and, provided,\nfurther that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage\navailable for a cost not exceeding such amount.\nCertain Effects of the Merger\nIf the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved by the Company stockholders, and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or\n(to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Covetrus upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nAs the Surviving Corporation, Covetrus will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nFollowing the Merger, all of Covetrus\u2019 equity interests will be legally and beneficially owned by Parent, and none of Covetrus\u2019 current stockholders will,\nby virtue of the Merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the surviving corporation or Parent after the completion of the Merger\n(except CD&R VFC Holdings will have an indirect ownership interest in Covetrus as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Support and\nRollover Agreement). As a result, Covetrus\u2019 current stockholders (other than CD&R VFC Holdings) will no longer benefit from any increase in the value,\nnor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Company common stock. Following the Merger, Parent will benefit from any increase in\nCovetrus\u2019 enterprise value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in Covetrus\u2019 enterprise value.\nFor information regarding the effects of the Merger on Covetrus\u2019 outstanding equity awards, see the sections entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Interests of\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 68, and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\u037e\nCompany ESPP,\u201d beginning on page 86.\nCompany common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cCVET.\u201d Following the completion of\nthe Merger, the shares of Company common stock will no longer be traded on NASDAQ or any other public market. In addition, the registration of the\nshares of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Covetrus will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports\nwith the SEC with respect to Company common stock. Termination of registration of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the\ninformation required to be furnished by Covetrus to Covetrus\u2019 stockholders and the SEC, and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such\nas the requirement to file annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of\nSection 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders\u2019 meetings pursuant to Section 14(a)\nof the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Covetrus to the extent that they apply solely as a result of the registration of Company common stock under\nthe Exchange Act.\nThe primary detriments of the Merger to stockholders unaffiliated with Parent, CD&R and TPG include the lack of an interest of such stockholders in the\npotential future earnings, growth or value realized by the Company after the Merger.\nConsequences if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not\nreceive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for your shares of Company common stock. Instead, Covetrus will remain a public company, and the\nCompany common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar\nto that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of Company common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and\nopportunities as they currently are subject to with\n74\nTable of Contents\nrespect to their ownership of Company common stock. If the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of Company common stock, including the risk that the market price of Company common stock may decline to the extent\nthat the current market price of Company common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement\nProposal is not approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any\nother transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, (i) Covetrus may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of\n$88,315,000 or (ii) Parent may be required to pay Covetrus a termination fee of $197,950,000. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees,\u201d beginning on page 110.\nYou should also read and consider carefully the other information in this proxy statement, the Annexes to this proxy statement and the documents\nincorporated by reference herein, including the risk factors contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. See the\nsection entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the disposition of Company common stock for cash in the Merger\nto \u201cU.S. Holders\u201d (as defined below). This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal\nincome taxation that might be relevant to U.S. Holders. This summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), existing, proposed and temporary regulations thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof in\neffect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the\nstatements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service\n(which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be\ngiven that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS.\nThe summary applies only to U.S Holders in whose hands shares of Company common stock are capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode. This summary does not address foreign, state or local tax consequences of the Merger, nor does it address the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the transactions to special classes of taxpayers (e.g., stockholders that beneficially own (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the\ntotal fair market value of the shares of Company common stock, small business investment companies, S corporations, regulated investment companies,\nreal estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, qualified foreign pension funds or qualified\ncollective investment vehicles, persons that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, cooperatives, banks and certain other financial\ninstitutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, governmental organizations, retirement plans, stockholders that are, or hold\nshares of Company common stock through, partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, stockholders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar, dealers in securities or foreign currency, traders that mark-to-market\ntheir securities, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, stockholders holding shares of Company common stock that are part of a\nstraddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated security transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, stockholders who properly\nexercise appraisal rights with respect to their shares of Company common stock, stockholders who hold their shares of Company common stock as\n\u201cqualified small business stock\u201d or \u201csection 1244 stock,\u201d stockholders who received shares of Company common stock in compensatory transactions\n(including pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options, stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights, as restricted stock or otherwise as\ncompensation), stockholders who are not exchanging shares of Covetrus shares for cash, and stockholders who\n75\nTable of Contents\nactually or constructively own an interest in Parent). In addition, this summary does not address U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (including any\nU.S. federal estate or gift tax consequences), or any aspect of the U.S. alternative minimum tax or Medicare tax on net investment income.\nIf a partnership, or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of the Company common\nstock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of its partners or members generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the\npartnership\u2019s activities. Accordingly, partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes that hold shares of\nCompany common stock, and partners or members in those entities, are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to them of the Merger.\nThis discussion does not address the tax consequences of acquisitions or dispositions of shares of Company common stock outside the Merger, or\ntransactions pertaining to options or other equity awards of the Company in connection with the Merger.\nFor purposes of this summary, the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, is or is treated as: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e (ii) a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e (iii) an estate, the\nincome of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or (iv) a trust, if (A) a United States court is able to exercise primary\nsupervision over the trust\u2019s administration and one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have authority\nto control all of the trust\u2019s substantial decisions or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO U.S.\nHOLDERS. WE URGE U.S. HOLDERS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO\nTHE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT\nAND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER APPLICABLE U.S. TAX TREATIES AND STATE, LOCAL\nOR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.\nTax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S.\nHolders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of\ncash received and (ii) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company common stock surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Gain or\nloss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company common stock (that is, shares of Company common stock acquired at the same\ncost in a single transaction) surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss would be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the\nholding period for such block of shares of Company common stock is more than one year at the time of consummation of the Merger. Long-term capital\ngains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital\nlosses by a U.S. Holder is subject to certain limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds received by a holder\npursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies\nunder penalty of perjury that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form). Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s\nU.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the Required Information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe tax discussion set forth above is included for general information only and is not tax advice. You are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine\nthe particular tax consequences to you of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws and\ntreaties.\nTreatment of"

            "Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Discussion Materials Provided to CD&R and TPG\nIn connection with the Transactions, CD&R and TPG engaged Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d), an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm, to provide limited financial advisory services to CD&R and TPG. In connection with Deutsche Bank\u2019s engagement, Deutsche\nBank provided to representatives of CD&R and TPG, for informational purposes only, (i) discussion materials dated April 29, 2022 (the \u201cApril 29 DB\nDiscussion Materials\u201d), (ii) discussion materials dated May 5, 2022 (the \u201cMay 5 DB Discussion Materials\u201d), (iii) discussion materials dated May 7, 2022\n(the \u201cMay 7 DB Discussion Materials\u201d) and (iv) discussion materials dated May 13, 2022 (the \u201cMay 13 DB Discussion Materials\u201d and, together with the\nApril 29 DB Discussion Materials, the May 5 DB Discussion Materials and the May 7 DB Discussion Materials, the \u201cDB Discussion Materials\u201d). Copies\nof the DB Discussion Materials have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13e-3 and are incorporated herein by reference. The DB Discussion Materials\nwill be made available for inspection and copying at the principal executive offices of the Company during its regular business hours by any interested\nequity security holder of the Company or a representative thereof who has been so designated in writing. The description of the DB Discussion Materials\nset forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such DB Discussion Materials.\nThe DB Discussion Materials were provided for the information of CD&R and TPG in connection with the proposed Transactions and were not provided\nto the Company, the Transaction Committee or the Board prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement. Deutsche Bank was not asked to, and it did\nnot, among other things, (i) assist with any price or other negotiations in connection with the Transactions or otherwise, (ii) render or deliver any\nopinion (whether as to the fairness of any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise) or\n(iii) provide any recommendation as to how to vote or act on any matters relating to the Transactions or otherwise. In addition, the financial analyses\nand observations reflected in the DB Discussion Materials were not analyses or observations with respect to the fairness of any consideration\n(including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise, did not reflect an opinion of Deutsche Bank as to the fairness\nof any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise and should not be viewed as a factor\nconsidered by the CD&R Entities, TPG, the Board, the Transaction Committee, the Company\u2019s management or otherwise with respect to the fairness of\nany consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise. Further, the DB Discussion Materials do\nnot constitute a recommendation to the CD&R Entities, TPG, the Board, the Transaction Committee, the Company\u2019s management or otherwise with\nrespect to the fairness of any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise. Deutsche Bank\nexpressed no view as to, and it did not address, the underlying business decision of any party to the Transactions to effect or enter into the Transactions,\nthe relative merits of the Transactions as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for any such party or the effect of any other\ntransaction which any such party might engage in or consider. The DB Discussion Materials were preliminary and informational and are not reflective\nof certain procedures typically applicable to materials or presentations in connection with delivering an opinion.\nWhile the DB Discussion Materials include various analyses and observations (as described below), the CD&R Entities and TPG believe that those\nanalyses and observations were preliminary only and did not take into account all relevant factors\u037e therefore, the CD&R Entities and TPG did not\nconsider such materials in determining an appropriate price for the Company or any of its business divisions, either in connection\n56Table of Contents\nwith the Transactions or in future possible exit scenarios. The CD&R Entities and TPG did not rely on the DB Discussion Materials in negotiating the\nconsideration payable in the Transactions or any other terms of the Transactions or in deciding to enter into the Merger Agreement or the\nTransactions. This section and the DB Discussion Materials have nevertheless been provided in response to certain regulations governing Schedule\n13e-3 transactions.\nIn preparing the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify,\nany information, whether publicly available or furnished to, discussed with or reviewed by Deutsche Bank, concerning the Company, its business\ndivisions or any other entity or business, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the preparation of the DB\nDiscussion Materials. Accordingly, for purposes of the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank assumed and relied upon the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare, obtain\nor review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise), of\nthe Company, its business divisions or any other entity or business, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company, its\nbusiness divisions or any other entity or business under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Deutsche Bank expressed no view\nas to any pending or potential litigation, claims or governmental, regulatory or other proceedings or investigations or the potential impact thereof on the\nCompany, its business divisions or any other entity or business, the Transactions or otherwise.\nDeutsche Bank did not have access to or otherwise engage in any communications with the Board, the Transaction Committee, the management of the\nCompany or any of their respective advisors in preparing the DB Discussion Materials. Deutsche Bank relied primarily on the portion of the Financial\nForecasts provided to CD&R and TPG by the Company\u2019s management. Deutsche Bank assumed that the financial and other information prepared or\nprovided by or discussed with CD&R and TPG were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then currently available estimates and judgments\nas to the matters covered thereby. Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of any financial forecasts and projections or other\ninformation utilized in its analyses or the assumptions on which they were based or the consideration payable in the Transactions.\nThe DB Discussion Materials did not in any manner address the value of Company common stock or the Company taken as a whole or the prices at\nwhich Company common stock or other securities would trade following the announcement or consummation of the Transactions. Deutsche Bank did not\nexpress any view with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to accounting, tax or other\nconsequences resulting from the proposed Transactions or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards or tax and other laws,\nregulations and governmental and legislative policies affecting the Company, its business divisions or any other entity or business or the Transactions.\nThe preliminary financial considerations and other information in the DB Discussion Materials reflected market data proximate to such DB Discussion\nMaterials and were based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances in effect on, and information made available\nto Deutsche Bank as of, the respective dates on which the DB Discussion Materials were prepared, as well as the portion of the Financial Forecasts\nprovided to CD&R and TPG by the Company\u2019s management. Subsequent developments may affect the DB Discussion Materials and Deutsche Bank\nexpressly disclaims any undertaking or obligation to update, revise or reaffirm the DB Discussion Materials or to advise any person of any change in any\nfact or matter affecting the DB Discussion Materials of which Deutsche Bank may become aware after the respective dates of the DB Discussion\nMaterials.\nIn preparing the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank reviewed a variety of preliminary financial and comparative matters, including those\nsummarized below. Deutsche Bank also considered industry performance, general financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and\ncircumstances existing as of dates\n57\nTable of Contents\nproximate to the DB Discussion Materials, many of which are beyond the control of the CD&R Entities, TPG and the Company.\nThe estimates or results contained in the DB Discussion Materials are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the DB Discussion Materials. In addition, the results of a financial review of\nthe value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or\nacquired. Accordingly, the estimates utilized and results reflected in the DB Discussion Materials were inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nDeutsche Bank was not requested to, and it did not, recommend, determine or otherwise participate in the negotiation of the consideration payable in the\nTransactions. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Transactions were determined through negotiations among the CD&R Entities and\nTPG, on the one hand, and the Company, the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors), on the other hand, and the\ndecision to enter into the Merger Agreement was that of the parties to the Merger Agreement. The DB Discussion Materials were viewed by the CD&R\nEntities and TPG as having limited relevance and were not relied on by the CD&R Entities or TPG in arriving at the decision to enter into the Merger\nAgreement or the Transactions, and the DB Discussion Materials had no influence on the CD&R Entities\u2019 and TPG\u2019s analysis or negotiation of the\nconsideration payable in the Transactions or any other terms of the Transactions.\nThe summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses and observations performed by Deutsche Bank, nor\ndoes the order of the financial analyses or observations described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses or\nobservations by Deutsche Bank. Certain financial analyses and observations summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In\norder to fully understand the financial analyses and observations, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary as the tables alone do\nnot constitute a complete description of the financial analyses and observations. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the financial analyses and observations, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the financial analyses and\nobservations, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses and observations. Future results may be different from those\ndescribed and such differences may be material.\nSummary of the DB Discussion Materials.\nThe April 29 DB Discussion Materials, the May 5 DB Discussion Materials and the May 7 DB Discussion Materials were each prior iterations of the May\n13 DB Discussion Materials and contain the same topics, financial analyses and observations and substantially similar information as those included in\nthe May 13 DB Discussion Materials.
