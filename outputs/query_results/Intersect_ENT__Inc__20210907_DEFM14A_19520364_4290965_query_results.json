            "PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger\nAgreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger\nAgreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are\ngoverned by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information\ncontained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement and contained in the confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, the\nrepresentations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating\ncontractual risk between Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may\nbe subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.\nStockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of Intersect ENT, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement\nas actual limitations on the respective businesses of Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may\ntake certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger\nAgreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice\nto the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with\ninformation regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding\nIntersect ENT, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties,\ncovenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the\ninformation provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Intersect ENT and its\nbusiness."
