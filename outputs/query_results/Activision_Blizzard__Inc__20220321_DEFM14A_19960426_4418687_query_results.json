As more fully described in the Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be\nmerged with and into Activision Blizzard, with Activision Blizzard continuing as the surviving corporation\nand a subsidiary of Microsoft (the \u201cMerger\u201d), and (ii) each outstanding share of the common stock, par\nvalue $0.000001 per share, of Activision Blizzard (\u201cActivision Blizzard Common Stock\u201d) will be converted into\nthe right to receive $95.00 per share in cash (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of the\nMerger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.\nAllen & Company LLC (\u201cAllen & Company\u201d) has acted as a financial advisor to Activision Blizzard in\nconnection with the proposed Merger and has been asked to render an opinion to the Board of Directors of\nActivision Blizzard (the \u201cBoard\u201d) as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Activision\nBlizzard Common Stock, other than as specified below, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such\nholders pursuant to the Agreement.

No portion of the Opinion Fee is\ncontingent upon either the conclusion expressed in this opinion or successful consummation of the Merger.\nActivision Blizzard also has agreed to reimburse Allen & Company\u2019s reasonable expenses and to indemnify\nAllen & Company and related parties against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.\nAllen & Company, as part of our investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and related\nfinancings, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes.

For\npurposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Allen & Company\ncalculated implied terminal values for Activision Blizzard by applying to Activision Blizzard\u2019s unlevered,\nafter-tax free cash flows for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026 a selected range of perpetuity growth\nrates of 2.25% to 2.75% and a selected range of discount rates of 6.50% to 8.00%. This analysis indicated the\nfollowing approximate implied equity value per share reference range for Activision Blizzard, as compared to\nthe merger consideration:\nImplied Equity Value Per Share \nReference Range:\nMerger Consideration\n$84.73 - $123.87\n$95.00\nCertain Additional Information. Allen & Company observed certain additional information that was not\nconsidered as part of its financial analyses for its opinion but was noted for informational reference only,\nincluding the following:\nhistorical trading prices of Activision Blizzard common stock during the 52-week period ended\nJanuary 14, 2022, which indicated low to high intraday prices for Activision Blizzard common stock\nduring such period of approximately $56.40 to $104.53 per share\u037e and\npublicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 forward stock price targets for Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock, which indicated an overall low to high target price range for Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock of $54.00 to $125.00 per share (with a mean of $90.52 per share and a median of $90.00\nper share).\nMiscellaneous\nActivision Blizzard selected Allen & Company as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based\non, among other things, Allen & Company\u2019s reputation, experience and familiarity with Activision Blizzard\nand the industry in which Activision Blizzard operates. Allen & Company, as part of its investment banking\nbusiness, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers\nand acquisitions, private placements and related financings, negotiated underwritings, secondary\ndistributions of listed and unlisted securities, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. As the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware, although during the two-year period prior to the date of its\nopinion Allen & Company did not provide investment banking services to Activision Blizzard unrelated to\nthe merger or to Microsoft for which Allen & Company received compensation, Allen & Company in the\nfuture may provide such services to Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and/or their respective affiliates, for\nwhich Allen & Company would expect to receive compensation. In the ordinary course, Allen & Company as\na broker-dealer and certain of its affiliates, directors and officers have invested or may invest, hold long or\nshort positions and may trade, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, for their own or\nbeneficiaries\u2019 accounts or for those of Allen & Company\u2019s clients, in the debt and equity securities (or\nrelated derivative securities) of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and/or their respective affiliates. The issuance\nof Allen & Company\u2019s opinion was approved by Allen & Company\u2019s opinion committee.\nFor Allen & Company\u2019s financial advisory services, Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay Allen & Company\nan aggregate cash fee of $65 million, of which $10 million was payable upon delivery of Allen & Company\u2019s\nopinion and $55 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the merger. Activision Blizzard also has\nagreed to reimburse Allen & Company\u2019s reasonable expenses and to indemnify Allen & Company and related\nparties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its\nengagement.\nTreatment of Equity Compensation\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock in the form of stock options and stock units (i.e., RSUs and PSUs). Our executive officers hold\noptions, RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock based on\nservice over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock ranging from 0 to 125% (and, in some cases, up to 250%) of the target\n57 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnumber of shares based on both service over a time-based vesting schedule and achievement of specified\nperformance goals over a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold options and RSUs,\nwhich represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, subject to vesting\nrequirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as a separation from\nservice. The merger agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity\nawards:\nStock Options\nEach outstanding option to purchase Activision Blizzard common stock granted pursuant to our\nequity incentive plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, or (ii) will become\nvested by its terms at the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the\nmerger consideration for each share of Activision Blizzard common stock that would have been\nissuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the effective time, less the applicable\noption exercise price for each such share of Activision Blizzard common stock underlying such option\nand any applicable withholding taxes.\nEach option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, and is not cancelled and\nconverted as described above, and has an exercise price per share of Activision Blizzard common\nstock that is less than the merger consideration, will be, as of the effective time and as determined by\nMicrosoft, (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a nonqualified stock option or (y) converted\ninto a nonqualified stock option granted pursuant to Microsoft\u2019s equity incentive plans, in either\ncase, in respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded\ndown to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\nsubject to such assumed option as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on\ntarget performance levels, as applicable) multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the\nmerger consideration and (B) the denominator of which is Microsoft\u2019s stock price (i.e., the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above\nrounded up) of common stock of Microsoft on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending\nwith the last trading day ending immediately prior to the closing date) (which we refer to as the\n\u201cexchange ratio\u201d), at an exercise price per share of common stock of Microsoft equal to (i) the exercise\nprice of such option divided by (ii) the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)\nrounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. In each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this\nparagraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting and exercisability will remain the same with\nrespect to Activision Blizzard options subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to Activision\nBlizzard options subject to performance-based vesting will be converted into time-based vesting\noptions (determined based on target performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the\noriginal performance period.\nIn the event that the exercise price per share under any option is equal to or greater than the merger\nconsideration, such option will be cancelled as of the effective time without payment therefor and will\nhave no further force or effect.\nStock Units\nEach outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs granted pursuant to Activision Blizzard\u2019s equity incentive\nplans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) will become vested by its terms\nat the effective time or (iii) is granted to a non-employee member of the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors, will, as of the effective time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger\nconsideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to such award,\nless any applicable withholding taxes.\nEach outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective\ntime and is not cancelled and converted as described above, will, as of the effective time, be, as\ndetermined by Microsoft (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a stock-based award or (y)\nconverted into a stock-based award pursuant to Microsoft\u2019s equity incentive plans, in either case, in\nrespect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded down to\nthe nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\n58 \n"
