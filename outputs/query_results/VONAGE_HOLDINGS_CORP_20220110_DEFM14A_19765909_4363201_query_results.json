The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the\neffective time of the Merger, will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or\notherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

            "Miscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any\nparticular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may\nhave given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less\nprobable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of Vonage. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Vonage\u2019s\n \n53Table of Contents\ncontrol. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\nterms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. This\nanalysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which Vonage Common Stock might actually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors considered by the Board in deciding to approve the Merger\nAgreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the merger\nconsideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\nterms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), or of whether the Board\nwould have been willing to agree to different consideration. The merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without\ninterest thereon, payable in the Merger was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Vonage and Parent and was unanimously approved\nby the Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Vonage during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific\nconsideration to Vonage or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from\nwhich conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short\npositions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Vonage, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates\nand Vonage or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the\nfuture provide investment banking and other financial services to Vonage or Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would\nexpect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provided Vonage with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed Merger for which it will be paid\napproximately $73 million, $250,000 of which was payable upon the execution of the engagement letter and $5 million of which was payable upon the\ndelivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the\nconsummation of the Merger. Vonage has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. Vonage has\nalso agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any\nperson controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain\nexpenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement."
