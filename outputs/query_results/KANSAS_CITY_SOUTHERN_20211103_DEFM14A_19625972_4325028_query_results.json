            "Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement and the Summary of the Merger Agreement\nThe merger agreement and the summary of its terms in this proxy statement/prospectus are included solely to provide you with information about the\nterms and conditions of the merger agreement. The terms and information in the merger agreement are not intended to provide any other public disclosure\nof factual information about CPRL, KCS, first merger sub and surviving merger sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The\nrepresentations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by CPRL, KCS, first merger sub and surviving merger sub were made solely for\nthe purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates and are qualified and subject to important limitations and exceptions agreed to by CPRL,\nKCS, first merger sub and surviving merger sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations\nand warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right\nto not complete the transaction if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue or incorrect, and allocating risk between the\nparties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual\nstandard of materiality or material adverse effect different from those generally applicable to shareholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC\nor on SEDAR, are qualified by certain matters contained in certain reports publicly filed with the SEC and on SEDAR, and in some cases were qualified by\nthe matters contained in the respective confidential disclosure schedules that CPRL and KCS delivered to each other in connection with the merger\nagreement, which disclosures were not included in the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. Moreover, information\nconcerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in\nKCS\u2019s or CPRL\u2019s public disclosures. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement except for the limited purposes expressly set\nforth therein and should not rely on the representations and warranties or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or\ncondition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.\nAccordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read\ntogether with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, and reports, statements and filings that CPRL and KCS file with the SEC and CPRL files on SEDAR from time to time.
