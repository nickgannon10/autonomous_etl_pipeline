In order to\nfully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the\ntext of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.\nThe analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion\nof such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Furthermore,\nmathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of\nusing the data referred to below.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and\nrelied upon the Financial Forecasts, as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201c- Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 45, and certain financial forecasts based on Wall Street\nresearch.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the Company, which is designed to provide\nan implied value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash\nflows and the terminal value of the company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share equity values\nas of September 30, 2021 for the shares of common stock. Morgan Stanley used estimates from the Financial\nForecasts for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows for the stub period of the fiscal year\n2021 and fiscal years 2022 through 2024 (the \u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d), which it calculated by deducting\nfrom Adjusted EBITDA for each such fiscal year (as set forth in greater detail in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c- Financial Forecasts\u201d) stock-based compensation expense, net working capital and net\ncapital expenditures and making certain further investment adjustments (including for certain categories of\ncash and bonus compensation, income tax benefit, professional fees, other income and special items). The\nestimates of Unlevered Free Cash Flow were based on the Financial Forecasts (prorated in the case of the\nstub fiscal year 2021), and were as follows:\n($ millions)\nFiscal Year ending December 31,\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n$ (43\n$(1,026\n$(800\n$(471\nFor the period from September 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021.\nMorgan Stanley also calculated a range of implied terminal enterprise values of the Company as of December\n31, 2024 by applying a range of implied exit multiples of 19.0x to 21.0x to the forecasted Adjusted EBITDA of\nthe Company for the twelve months ending December 31, 2025 with a midpoint of 20.0x at\n50 \n)(1)\n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexit. The range of multiples was selected, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience\nwith respect to valuations of these types of businesses, using the historical trading performance of the\nCompany relative to select public peers.\nMorgan Stanley then discounted the estimated Unlevered Free Cash Flow and range of estimated terminal\nvalues derived to present value as of September 30, 2021, using rates based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s judgment\nof the estimated range of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital of 5.6% to 6.4%, to derive ranges\nof implied enterprise values for the Company. From the ranges of implied enterprise values, Morgan Stanley\nthen deducted the Company\u2019s net debt of approximately $2.96 billion as of September 30, 2021, and added the\nvalue of certain equity investments of the Company of approximately $30 million as of September 30, 2021, to\narrive at a range of enterprise values for the Company, and subsequently derive a range of implied equity\nvalue in respect of the fully diluted share count as of September 30, 2021.\nThis analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for shares of common stock of\n$74.99-$89.71 (as compared to the proposed merger consideration of $90.50 per share of common stock).\nTrading Performance\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading range of shares of common stock for the 12-month period\nending September 27, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a\npotential sale of the Company). Morgan Stanley noted that the low and high closing prices for shares of\ncommon stock during such period were $61.64, on March 4, 2021, and $82.69, on June 10, 2021, respectively,\nper share.\nAnalysts\u2019 Price Target Analysis\nMorgan Stanley reviewed publicly available price targets for shares of common stock prepared and\npublished by over 20 equity research analysts. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for shares of\ncommon stock was $70.00 to $90.00, with a median price target of $80.50 per share of common stock, as of\nSeptember 27, 2021, to which Morgan Stanley applied a discount using cost of equity of 7.4% based on the\naverage of (a) the capital asset pricing based cost of equity using a risk premium assumption of 6.0% and\napplicable predicted beta according to MSCI\u2019s Barra\u2019s Risk Models and (b) the median broker reported cost\nof equity of 7.5%, resulting in a discounted price target range of $65.99 to $84.84, with a median price target\nof $74.94 per share of common stock and a mean price target of $74.43 per share of common stock, in each\ncase, based on Capital IQ.\nThe public market trading price targets published by securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect\ncurrent market trading prices for shares of common stock. All estimates are subject to uncertainties,\nincluding, but not limited to, the future financial performance of the Company and future financial market\nconditions.\nNet Asset Value\nMorgan Stanley reviewed publicly available net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) estimates for shares of common stock\npublished by those equity research analysts which published publicly available price targets for shares of\ncommon stock. As of September 27, 2021, the range of NAV estimates per share of common stock ranged\nfrom $59.00 to $92.60, with a median NAV estimate of $68.26 per share of common stock and a mean NAV\nestimate of $68.69 per share of common stock, in each case based on Capital IQ.\nComparative Public Trading Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading multiples analysis, which is designed to provide an implied\ntrading value of a company by comparing it to selected companies with similar characteristics to the\ncompany. Morgan Stanley compared certain financial information of the Company with publicly available\ninformation for the selected companies.\nMorgan Stanley selected these companies based on its professional judgment and because they are data\ncenter companies with business characteristics that, for purposes of its analysis, Morgan Stanley considered\nsimilar to the business characteristics of the Company.\n51 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe selected companies consisted of:\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR)\u037e\nEquinix, Inc. (EQIX)\u037e\nCoreSite Realty Corporation (COR)\u037e and\nSwitch Inc. (SWCH).\nMarket data for the selected companies was based on closing prices as of November 5, 2021. Balance sheet\ndata for the selected companies was as of the quarter ended September 30, 2021.\nFor purposes of this analysis, for each of the selected companies and the Company, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated:\nthe aggregate value for each such company (obtained by calculating the sum of equity market\ncapitalization of such company plus the net debt of such company and other applicable adjustments\nsuch as adjustments for preferred stock and minority interests) as a multiple of its estimated calendar\nyear 2022 EBITDA (based on Capital IQ consensus estimates) (referred to as \u201cAV / 2022E EBITDA\u201d)\u037e\nand\nthe price per share for each such company a multiple of its estimated calendar year 2022 funds from\noperations per share (based on Capital IQ consensus estimates) (referred to as \u201cP / 2022E FFO\u201d).\nBased on the analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected companies (excluding Equinix, Inc. from\nthe selected company averages given the difference in its scale and business mix), Morgan Stanley adjusted\nthe peer multiple range based on the Company\u2019s historical discount to peers and applied the relevant\nadjusted multiples to the relevant 2022 metric based on the estimates prepared by Company management"
