The descriptions of the Merger\nAgreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger\nAgreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are\ngoverned by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information\ncontained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(i) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (ii) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (iii) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Arena, Pfizer and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement and contained in the confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, the representations and\nwarranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between\nArena, Pfizer and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of\nmateriality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-\nparty beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants\nand agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Arena,\nPfizer or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the\nsubject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In\naddition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective\nbusinesses of Arena, Pfizer and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly\npermitted in the confidential disclosure schedule to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the\nappropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Arena, Pfizer, Merger Sub or their respective\nbusinesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement\nshould not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our\nfilings with the SEC regarding Arena and its business."
