The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and\nafter the effective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share\nof common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (\u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) that is outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than (a) Dissenting Shares (as such term is defined in the\nMerger Agreement), (b) Parent-held Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), or (c)\nshares held in treasury by the Company, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount\nequal to $57.50, without interest thereon (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of the Merger are\nmore fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in\naccordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other\nthan Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and\ncertain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company.

The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any\nportion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners\nutilized both the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and the consensus of third-party research analysts\u2019 projections\nas of August 4, 2021 (\u201cAnalyst Projections\u201d). Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.\nConsidering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view\nof Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of\npotential per-share present values for Cornerstone common stock as of June 30, 2021 (which is the end of\nCornerstone\u2019s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet date) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n(i)\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of Cornerstone, based\non the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan, for the third quarter of calendar year 2021 through calendar\nyear 2025 (which implied present value was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 8.0% to\n12.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Cornerstone)\u037e and\n(ii)\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Cornerstone, calculated by\nmultiplying the estimated unlevered free cash flow in calendar year 2026 of approximately $381 million\nbased on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan (noting that such number was based on a long-term\ncash tax rate of 20.0%, as provided by Cornerstone management), by a range of multiples of fully\ndiluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated unlevered free cash flow of 14.0x to 23.0x\n(which were chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment) and discounted to present\nvalue using the same range of discount rates used in item (i) above\u037e and\n(iii) Cornerstone\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of $149 million as of June 30, 2021, as provided by\nCornerstone management\u037e\n\u2022\nsubtracting the $300 million face value of Cornerstone\u2019s outstanding convertible debt and the $828 million\nprincipal amount of Cornerstone\u2019s outstanding term loan, each as of June 30, 2021, as provided by\nCornerstone management\u037e and\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock\n(calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), which takes into account restricted stock units,\nperformance-based restricted stock units and in-the-money stock options as of July 30, 2021 and inclusive\nof a subsequent August 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which amounts were provided by Cornerstone\u2019s\nmanagement, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt, with each of the above-\nreferenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the\ndegree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period (0.25%\ncombined in the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2021 and approximately 3% annually through\ncalendar year 2025) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future\nequity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Cornerstone management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone common\nstock of approximately $41.63 to $76.14.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Cornerstone with publicly\navailable information and public market multiples for selected companies, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in\nits professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of\nbusiness to Cornerstone, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or\nsimilar characteristics.

Based on the fully diluted shares of Cornerstone common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury\nstock method), which takes into account restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and in-the-\nmoney stock options as of July 30, 2021 and inclusive of a subsequent August 2, 2021 RSU grant, all of which\namounts were provided by Cornerstone\u2019s management, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money\nconvertible debt, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Cornerstone common stock of approximately\n$37.13 to $60.41 based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and approximately $37.87 to $61.40 based on the\nAnalyst Projections.\nBased upon the Analyst Projections as of August 4, 2021, for calendar year 2022, and using the closing prices as of\nAugust 4, 2021, for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied\nfully diluted equity value divided by the estimated consensus levered free cash flow for calendar year 2022 (the\n\u201cCY2022E LFCF Multiples\u201d) for each of the selected companies.\nThe CY2022E LFCF Multiple for Cornerstone was 13.2x based on the Analyst Projections, and the fully diluted equity\nvalue of Cornerstone was calculated using the closing price of Cornerstone common stock as of the Unaffected Date.\nBased on the analysis of the CY2022E LFCF Multiples for each of the selected companies and the application of its\nprofessional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 12.0x to 20.0x and applied this range to\nCornerstone\u2019s estimated calendar year 2022 levered free cash flow based on each of the Adjusted Internal Long\nRange Plan and the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count calculation as used for the\nanalysis utilizing CY2022E Revenue Multiples above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCornerstone common stock of approximately $45.16 to $72.32 based on the Adjusted Internal Long Range Plan and\napproximately $40.15 to $64.33 based on the Analyst Projections.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Cornerstone. In evaluating the selected\ncompanies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control\nof Cornerstone, such as the impact of competition on Cornerstone\u2019s business and the industry in general, industry\ngrowth and the absence of any material adverse change in Cornerstone\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the\nindustry or in the financial markets in general.
