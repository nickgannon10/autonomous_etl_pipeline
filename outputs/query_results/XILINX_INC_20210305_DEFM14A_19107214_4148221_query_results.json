See\n\u201cThe Merger-\u200bRecommendation of the AMD Board of Directors\u037e AMD\u2019s Reasons for the Merger.\u201d\nRecord Date for the AMD Special Meeting and Voting Rights\nThe record date to determine AMD stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the AMD\nspecial meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof is February 10, 2021. As of the close of\nbusiness on the AMD record date, there were 1,211,803,421 shares of AMD common stock issued and\noutstanding and entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting.\n55 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nEach AMD stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of AMD common stock such holder owned of\nrecord at the close of business on the AMD record date with respect to each matter properly brought before\nthe AMD special meeting. Only AMD stockholders of record at the close of business on the AMD record date\nare entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the AMD special meeting and any and all adjournments or\npostponements thereof.\nQuorum\u037e Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes\nA quorum of AMD stockholders is necessary to conduct the AMD special meeting. The presence, virtually via\nthe AMD special meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding\nshares of AMD common stock entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting will constitute a quorum. Shares of\nAMD common stock represented at the AMD special meeting by virtual attendance via the AMD special\nmeeting website or by proxy and entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which an AMD\nstockholder directs an \u201cabstention\u201d from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.\nHowever, because all of the proposals for consideration at the AMD special meeting are considered \u201cnon-\nroutine\u201d matters under Nasdaq rules (as described below), shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be counted as\npresent for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the AMD stockholder provides their\nbank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals at the AMD special\nmeeting. If a quorum is not present, the AMD special meeting will be adjourned or postponed until the holders\nof the number of shares of AMD common stock required to constitute a quorum attend.\nUnder Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d on behalf of the\nbeneficial owner of such shares have the authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain \u201croutine\u201d\nproposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners. However, banks,\nbrokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under\nNasdaq rules are \u201cnon-routine.\u201d This can result in a \u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d which occurs on an item when (i) a\nbank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more \u201croutine\u201d proposals to be\nvoted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other \u201cnon-routine\u201d proposals without\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank,\nbroker or other nominee with voting instructions on a \u201cnon-routine\u201d matter. All of the proposals before the\nAMD special meeting are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under Nasdaq rules, and banks, brokers or other\nnominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the AMD special meeting. As a\nresult, AMD does not expect any broker non-votes at the AMD special meeting and if you hold your shares of\nAMD common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your shares will not be represented and will not be voted on any matter\nunless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance\nwith the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you\ncast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote\non any of the proposals before the AMD special meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owners.\nRequired Votes\nExcept for the AMD adjournment proposal, the vote required to approve each of the proposals listed below\nassumes the presence of a quorum at the AMD special meeting. As described above, AMD does not expect\nthere to be any broker non-votes at the AMD special meeting.\nProposal\nRequired Vote\nEffects of Certain Actions\nAMD\nProposal 1:\nAMD share\nissuance\nproposal\nApproval requires the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding shares of AMD common stock\nthat are virtually present via the AMD special\nmeeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on\nthe AMD share issuance proposal.\nAny shares not virtually present or\nrepresented by proxy (including due to the\nfailure of an AMD stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker\nor other nominee to provide voting\ninstructions to such bank, broker or other\nnominee) will have no effect on the outcome of\nthe AMD share issuance proposal.\n56 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProposal\nRequired Vote\nEffects of Certain Actions\nAn abstention or other failure of any shares\nvirtually present or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on\nthe AMD share issuance proposal to vote on\nthe AMD share issuance proposal will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the AMD\nshare issuance proposal. However, assuming a\nquorum is present at the AMD special meeting,\nif an AMD stockholder who holds shares in\n\u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other\nnominee provides voting instructions for one\nor more other proposals, but not for the AMD\nshare issuance proposal, voting power will\ndeemed to be withheld with respect to the\nAMD share issuance proposal and such failure\nto provide voting instructions will have no\neffect on the AMD share issuance proposal.\nAMD\nProposal 2:\nAMD\nadjournment\nproposal\nApproval requires the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding shares of AMD common stock\nthat are virtually present via the AMD special\nmeeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on\nthe AMD adjournment proposal.\nAny shares not virtually present or\nrepresented by proxy (including due to the\nfailure of an AMD stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker\nor other nominee to provide voting\ninstructions to such bank, broker or other\nnominee) will have no effect on the outcome of\nthe AMD adjournment proposal.\nAn abstention or other failure of any shares\nvirtually present or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on\nthe AMD adjournment proposal will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the AMD\nadjournment proposal. However, if an AMD\nstockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d\nthrough a bank, broker or other nominee\nprovides voting instructions for one or more\nother proposals, but not for the AMD\nadjournment proposal, voting power will\ndeemed to be withheld with respect to the\nAMD adjournment proposal and such failure to\nprovide voting instructions will have no effect\non the AMD adjournment proposal.\nVote of AMD Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,\nAMD directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote\napproximately 1% of the total outstanding shares of AMD common stock. Although none of them has entered\ninto any agreement obligating them to do so, AMD currently expects that all AMD directors and executive\nofficers will vote their shares \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD share issuance proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD adjournment\nproposal. See \u201cInterests of AMD Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d as well as \u201cInformation\nAbout AMD\u2019s Board of Directors and Executive Officers,\u201d \u201cAMD Directors\u2019 Compensation and Benefits\u201d and\n\u201cAMD Executive Compensation.\u201d\n57 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMethods of Voting\nRegistered Stockholders\nIf you are an AMD stockholder of record, you may vote at the AMD special meeting by proxy over the\ninternet or telephone or by mail, or by virtually attending and voting at the AMD special meeting via the AMD\nspecial meeting website, as described below.\nBy Internet: By following the instructions provided on your proxy card.\nBy Telephone: By following the instructions provided on your proxy card.\nBy Mail: If you have received a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail, you may complete and\nreturn by mail the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope.\nVirtually via the AMD Special Meeting Website: By visiting the AMD special meeting website, you can\nvirtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting. AMD stockholders who plan to virtually attend\nthe AMD special meeting will need the 16-digit control number included on their proxy card in order\nto access the AMD special meeting website.\nUnless revoked, all duly executed proxies representing shares of AMD common stock entitled to vote at the\nAMD special meeting will be voted at the AMD special meeting and, where a choice has been specified on the\nproxy card, will be voted in accordance with such specification. If you submit an executed proxy without\nproviding instructions for any proposal, then the AMD officers identified on the proxy will vote your shares\nconsistent with the recommendation of the AMD board of directors on such proposal.

If you deliver an executed proxy, but do\nnot specify a choice for any proposal properly brought before the AMD special meeting, such proxies will\nvote your shares of AMD common stock on such uninstructed proposal in accordance with the\nrecommendation of the AMD board of directors. AMD does not expect that any matter other than the\nproposals listed above will be brought before the AMD special meeting, and the AMD bylaws provide that the\nonly business that may be conducted at the AMD special meeting are those proposals brought before the\nAMD special meeting by or at the direction of the AMD board of directors.\nBeneficial (Street Name) Stockholders\nIf you hold your shares of AMD common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee in \u201cstreet name\u201d\ninstead of as a registered holder, you must follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee in order to vote your shares.

The presence, virtually\nvia the Xilinx special meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding\nshares of Xilinx common stock entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting will constitute a quorum. Shares of\nXilinx common stock represented at the Xilinx special meeting by virtual attendance via the Xilinx special\nmeeting website or by proxy and entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which a Xilinx\nstockholder directs an \u201cabstention\u201d from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.\nHowever, because all of the proposals for consideration at the Xilinx special meeting are considered \u201cnon-\nroutine\u201d matters under Nasdaq rules (as described below), shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be counted as\npresent for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the Xilinx stockholder provides their\nbank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals at the Xilinx special\nmeeting.

However, banks,\nbrokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under\nNasdaq rules are \u201cnon-routine.\u201d This can result in a \u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d which occurs on an item when (i) a\nbank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more \u201croutine\u201d proposals to be\nvoted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other \u201cnon-routine\u201d proposals without\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank,\nbroker or other nominee with voting instructions on a \u201cnon-routine\u201d matter.

Although no Xilinx director or executive\nofficer has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, Xilinx currently expects that all Xilinx\ndirectors and executive officers will vote their shares \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx\ncompensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal.

If you submit an executed proxy without\nproviding instructions for any proposal, then the Xilinx officers identified on the proxy will vote your shares\nconsistent with the recommendation of the Xilinx board of directors on such proposal. If you are a Xilinx\nstockholder of record, proxies submitted over the internet or by telephone as described above must be\nreceived by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 6, 2021. To reduce administrative costs and help the\nenvironment by conserving natural resources, Xilinx asks that you submit a proxy to vote your shares through\nthe internet or by telephone.\nBy executing and delivering a proxy in connection with the Xilinx special meeting, you designate certain Xilinx\nofficers identified therein as your proxies at the Xilinx special meeting. If you deliver an executed proxy, but do\nnot specify a choice for any proposal properly brought before the Xilinx special meeting, such proxies will\nvote your shares of Xilinx common stock on such uninstructed proposal in accordance with the\nrecommendation of the Xilinx board of directors. Xilinx does not expect that any matter other than the\nproposals listed above will be brought before the Xilinx special meeting, and the Xilinx bylaws provide that\nthe only business that may be conducted at the Xilinx special meeting are those proposals brought before the\nXilinx special meeting by or at the direction of the Xilinx board of directors.\nBeneficial (Street Name) Stockholders\nIf you hold your shares of Xilinx common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee in \u201cstreet name\u201d\ninstead of as a registered holder, you must follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee in order to vote your shares.

If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee\nfor a proposal, your shares of Xilinx common stock will not be voted on that proposal because your bank,\nbroker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals to be voted on\nat the Xilinx special meeting. See \u201c-Quorum\u037e Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes.\u201d\nIf you hold your shares of Xilinx common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee in \u201cstreet name\u201d\n(instead of as a registered holder), you must obtain a specific control number from your bank, broker or other\nnominee in order to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting\nwebsite.
