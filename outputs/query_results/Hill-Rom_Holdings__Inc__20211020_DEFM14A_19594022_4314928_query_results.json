            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. This summary does not\npurport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to\nyou. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of\nwhich is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as the rights and\nobligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or\nany other information contained in this proxy statement.\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding\nthe terms of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any factual information about Hillrom, Baxter or\nMerger Sub or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Hillrom or Baxter contained in this proxy\nstatement or in Hillrom\u2019s or Baxter\u2019s public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the merger agreement and this\nsummary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts\nand circumstances relating to Hillrom or Baxter. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by\nand covenants of Hillrom, Baxter and Merger Sub that were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as\nof specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with\nnegotiating the terms of the merger agreement (including by being qualified by confidential disclosure schedules\nexchanged between the parties to the merger agreement) and may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality\nwhich may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors. In particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to\nbear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to close the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise,\nand allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. Information\nconcerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the\ndate of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement.\nAdditional information about Hillrom may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Hillrom\u2019s other public\nfilings.
