            "Background of the Merger\nMark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer of Nuance, joined Nuance as Chief Executive Officer and a director on April\n23, 2018. On the date prior to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment, the closing price of Nuance common stock was $14.91 per\nshare. Mr. Benjamin was charged by the Nuance Board of Directors with leading the planning and execution of a\nstrategic transformation of Nuance, with the goal of increasing shareholder value. In furtherance of that charge and in\nkeeping with the Nuance Board of Directors\u2019 commitment to maximizing shareholder value, over the approximately\nthree-year period since Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment, the Nuance Board of Directors and management have regularly\nreviewed and discussed Nuance\u2019s business strategy, performance and competitive position as well as various\nstrategic alternatives, including acquisitions, dispositions, commercial\n26TABLE OF CONTENTS\npartnerships and other strategic transactions. Since before Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of\nNuance, Evercore Group L.L.C., which we refer to as Evercore, has rendered advice to Nuance regarding various\nstrategic and financial matters in support of these efforts by the Nuance Board of Directors.\nOver the past three years, the Nuance Board of Directors have through these efforts directed a transformation of\nNuance\u2019s business through a series of value-creating actions, including the sale of Nuance\u2019s imaging business in\nFebruary 2019, the spin-off of Cerence, Nuance\u2019s automotive business, in October 2019, and the sale of Nuance\u2019s\nHealth Information Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business\nin March 2021, as well as share repurchases and debt reduction activities. Through these transactions and other\nstrategic initiatives, Nuance has streamlined its portfolio to focus on the healthcare and enterprise AI segments,\nwhere the Nuance Board of Directors and management observed accelerated demand for advanced conversational AI\nand ambient solutions.\nIn July 2019, a large private equity firm, which we refer to as Party A, contacted senior management of Nuance and\nrequested a meeting to discuss a potential acquisition of Nuance and requested that Nuance provide a form\nnondisclosure agreement.\nAlso in July 2019, the chief executive officer of a global technology company, which we refer to as Party B, contacted\nMr. Benjamin and expressed interest in meeting to discuss conversational AI technologies, among other topics.\nOn July 22, 2019, Nuance and Party A signed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did not\ncontain a standstill provision.\nOn August 15, 2019, members of Nuance\u2019s senior management met with representatives of Party A. The meeting\nconsisted of introductions of the Nuance and Party A teams and a high level discussion of Nuance\u2019s business. Party\nA made no proposal to acquire Nuance at that meeting and no immediate next steps were discussed. The closing\nprice of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.36 per share.\nOn August 21, 2019, Nuance and Party B amended an existing confidentiality agreement between the parties to,\namong other matters, extend the expiration date of such agreement. The amended nondisclosure agreement did not\ncontain a standstill provision.\nOn August 23, 2019, executives of Party B and Nuance, including the chief executive officer of each company, met to\nexplore whether there could be mutually beneficial ways for the two companies to work together, including potentially\na strategic partnership or an acquisition of Nuance by Party B. Following this meeting, Party B informed Nuance that\nit had elected not to proceed with further discussions regarding an acquisition transaction involving Nuance and\ncited a lack of strategic fit with Party B. The closing price of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.99 per share.\nBeginning prior to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of Nuance in April 2018 and through\nOctober 2019, representatives of Nuance and representatives of Microsoft engaged in discussions regarding a\npotential commercial partnership whereby Microsoft would become Nuance\u2019s exclusive cloud provider and Nuance\nand Microsoft would work together to develop and commercialize technology products and services for the\nhealthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.\nhealthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.\nOn October 1, 2019, Nuance completed the spin-off of Cerence that it had announced on November 19, 2018.\nOn October 9, 2019, Microsoft and Nuance formalized their strategic partnership by entering into a license and\ncollaboration agreement and an amendment to an existing cloud hosting agreement between the parties.\nOn October 17, 2019, at Party A\u2019s request, representatives of Nuance and Party A spoke by telephone. Party A\nadvised the Nuance representatives that Party A would be interested in exploring an acquisition of Nuance and that it\nbelieved it could offer a market-premium to Nuance\u2019s then-current stock price of $15.75 if it could confirm a number of\nassumptions with respect to Nuance\u2019s business. Following that meeting, Party A provided Nuance with a due\ndiligence request list and proposed work plan that contemplated substantial engagement between the parties through\nthe end of the year.\nFollowing receipt of Party A\u2019s diligence request list and work plan, Nuance considered the risks and benefits of\npursuing a transaction with Party A at that time. In considering these matters, senior management noted that Nuance\nhad just completed its spin-off of Cerence and was nearing its first post-spin analyst day, scheduled for\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDecember 10, 2019, which Nuance had planned as a re-launch of the new, streamlined Nuance business. In light of\nNuance\u2019s focus on, and the critical importance of, the re-launch of the Nuance business following the Cerence spin-\noff and subsequent analyst day, the challenges and risks associated with diverting management time from those\nexecution priorities and the uncertainty regarding Party A\u2019s interest, Nuance determined to defer further\nconversations with Party A.\nIn late October 2019, representatives of Nuance spoke with representatives of Party A, and informed them that, in\nlight of the recently completed Cerence spin-off and the planned analyst day, Nuance was not prepared to engage in\ndiscussions regarding a potential sale transaction at that time.\nOn December 10, 2019, Nuance hosted its planned analyst day. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common\nstock was $17.60 per share.\nIn January 2020, a representative of Evercore reviewed in the ordinary course of business development activities with\nrepresentatives of a large healthcare services and technology company, which we refer to as Party C, a number of\npotential acquisition opportunities, one of which was a potential acquisition of Nuance. During the conversation,\nrepresentatives of Party C expressed interest in scheduling a meeting with Nuance in the upcoming weeks. At the\nrequest of Party C, the representative of Evercore discussed the possibility of an introduction to Party C with\nmembers of Nuance senior management, who authorized scheduling such a meeting. The meeting was first scheduled\nfor February 13, 2020, then rescheduled to March 30, 2020. On March 24, 2020, the rescheduled meeting was\npostponed indefinitely due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying volatility in the broader\nstock market, including a decline in the price of Nuance\u2019s common stock, which had closed at $14.79 per share on\nMarch 23, 2020.\nOn February 25, 2020, during a conversation regarding another company in the ordinary course of business\ndevelopment activities, a representative of a leading cloud technology and e-commerce company, which we refer to\nas Party D, conveyed to representatives of Evercore Party D\u2019s interest in meeting with the senior leadership of\nNuance to explore potential opportunities involving Nuance, ranging from a potential strategic partnership in\nhealthcare to a potential acquisition of Nuance. The representative of Party D characterized their interest as\npreliminary, and indicated that Party D was seeking the meeting to learn more about Nuance\u2019s healthcare business in\nlight of its own nascent activities in the space. Following that conversation, a representative of Evercore\ncommunicated to Nuance senior management Party D\u2019s interest in a meeting with Nuance senior leadership.\nRepresentatives of Nuance and Party D scheduled a meeting for April 9, 2020, but subsequently canceled that\nmeeting due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic. Following such cancellation, Party D did not seek to reengage\nwith Nuance and Nuance and Party D did not have further discussions.\nOn April 22, 2020, Mr. Benjamin and representatives of Party A had a telephone conversation for the purpose of\nkeeping in touch. During that conversation, Party A did not renew its request to meet with Nuance to discussion a\npotential transaction.\nOn or around May 14, 2020, a representative of Party C in a conversation with a representative of Evercore, indicated\nParty C\u2019s desire to reengage in discussions with Nuance. Following that conversation, the representative of Evercore\ncommunicated Party C\u2019s interest to Nuance senior management, who scheduled such a meeting.\nOn June 19, 2020, representatives of Party C met with members of Nuance senior management at Nuance\u2019s offices. At\nthat meeting, Nuance representatives provided a high level overview of Nuance\u2019s Healthcare business based only on\npublicly available information, and Party C requested a second meeting to review Nuance\u2019s Enterprise business and\nto address follow up questions relating to the Healthcare business.\nOn June 26, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the Nuance\nBoard of Directors of the meeting with representatives of Party C. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board\nof Directors instructed Nuance management to hold another in-person meeting with Party C as had been requested\nby Party C.\nOn July 9, 2020, representatives of Party C had a phone conversation with Nuance senior executives to discuss\nNuance technology.\nOn July 22, 2020, representatives of Party C met with representatives of Nuance at Nuance\u2019s offices, during which the\nrepresentatives of Party C and Nuance discussed Nuance\u2019s Enterprise and Healthcare businesses.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 27, 2020, a representative of Party C informed a representative of Evercore that Party C was interested in\nfurther exploring a potential acquisition of Nuance. A representative of Evercore communicated Party C\u2019s interests to\nmembers of Nuance senior management.\nOn or around September 7, 2020, a senior executive of Party C contacted Mr. Benjamin and conveyed a request from\nthe Chief Executive Officer of Party C for another meeting at Nuance\u2019s offices and a demonstration of Nuance\u2019s\nDragon\u00ae Ambient eXperience\u2122 product, which we refer to as DAX.\nOn September 11, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the\nNuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, a representative of\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Nuance\u2019s external legal counsel, which we refer to as Paul Weiss,\nreviewed with the Nuance Board of Directors the directors\u2019 duties in the context of a potential acquisition offer.\nFollowing discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed Mr. Benjamin to have the meeting with the Chief\nExecutive Officer of Party C.\nOn September 15, 2020, representatives of Nuance\u2019s senior management met with the Chief Executive Officer of Party\nC and the president of one of Party C\u2019s divisions. At that meeting, Nuance representatives answered questions\nregarding the business and gave a demonstration of DAX. During the meeting, Mr. Benjamin made clear that he\nbelieved Nuance was in a strong position and expressed his view that the market was not overvaluing Nuance\u2019s\nshares. After such meeting, the representatives of Party C indicated to representatives of Evercore that the recent\nincrease in Nuance\u2019s share price had created valuation challenges for Party C in pursuing an acquisition of Nuance,\nnoting that the price of Nuance common stock had increased from approximately $25.00 per share when Party C\nbegan discussions in June 2020 to $32.97 as of close of trading on September 15, 2020. Representatives of Evercore\ncommunicated Party C\u2019s views to members of Nuance senior management.\nOn September 18, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the\nNuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, the Nuance Board of\nDirectors received an update from Nuance management on Nuance\u2019s stock performance, including Nuance\u2019s 5-year\nprice performance and trading multiples relative to peers.\nOn September 29, 2020, representatives of Party C informed representatives of Nuance and Evercore that Party C did\nnot wish to pursue a strategic transaction with Nuance at that time or for the foreseeable future, primarily due to Party\nC\u2019s view on Nuance\u2019s valuation and that any offer at a \u201cmarket\u201d premium to Nuance would be too dilutive to Party\nC\u2019s stockholders. They indicated that they could be interested in making an offer in the future if Nuance\u2019s share price\nwere to fall appreciably from where it was then trading, and in the meantime would like to continue to build upon the\ncommercial aspects of the relationship between Nuance and Party C. The closing price of Nuance common stock on\nthat date was $33.07 per share, which was approximately 121.8% higher than the closing price of Nuance common\nstock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 165.0% higher if\nincluding the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).\nOn October 2, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the\nNuance Board of Directors of Party C\u2019s decision not to pursue a transaction.\nOn November 11, 2020, a representative of Evercore had, in the ordinary course of business development activities,\nan introductory conversation with a senior executive at Microsoft. In the course of such conversation, which\naddressed multiple topics, including Microsoft\u2019s activities in the healthcare sector, the Evercore representative\ndiscussed recent developments with respect to Nuance. These discussions were preliminary and based solely on\npublicly available information, and no valuations involving Nuance were discussed. The representative of Microsoft\nexpressed Microsoft\u2019s strategic interest in Nuance\u2019s healthcare business, especially given the success of the\nongoing partnership between the two companies, but noted that Microsoft\u2019s willingness to consider a potential\ntransaction was tempered by the highly people-intensive nature of Nuance\u2019s Health Information Management\nTranscription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business.\nOn November 18, 2020, in conjunction with its earnings announcement, Nuance announced the sale of its Health\nInformation Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business, which\nNuance had been negotiating over the prior several months.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 19, 2020, representatives of Microsoft contacted representatives of Evercore and requested a meeting\nwith Nuance\u2019s management in order to begin evaluating the merits of a potential acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft.\nDuring this discussion, the representatives of Microsoft noted that the process would include a series of business\nand financial due diligence meetings to validate whether Microsoft did indeed want to pursue an acquisition of\nNuance. Representatives of Evercore conveyed this request to Mr. Benjamin.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting at which Mr. Benjamin\ninformed the Nuance Board of Directors of Microsoft\u2019s request for a meeting to explore a potential acquisition.\nFollowing discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors authorized a meeting with Microsoft to discuss with Microsoft\nonly publicly available information concerning Nuance.\nOn December 7, 2020, representatives of Microsoft and representatives of Nuance held an initial meeting at which\nthose present discussed Nuance\u2019s business and the potential benefits of a combination.\nOn December 18, 2020, representatives of Party C and representatives of Nuance had a telephone discussion focused\non potential commercial partnership opportunities between Party C and Nuance. There was no discussion of an\nacquisition of Nuance by Party C in that conversation.\nFollowing the meeting on December 7, 2020, various representatives of Microsoft had follow-up conversations with\nrepresentatives of Nuance, in the course of which representatives of Microsoft requested follow-up meetings with\nNuance in January to review Nuance\u2019s Healthcare and Enterprise businesses and the potential long-term\nopportunities for the two companies on a combined basis. Representatives of Microsoft indicated that following\nsuch meetings and shortly after Nuance\u2019s next earnings release, Microsoft intended to either make a formal proposal\nfor an acquisition of Nuance or notify Nuance that it did not wish to move forward with making an offer.\nOn December 22, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Nuance management updated\nthe Nuance Board of Directors on its discussions with Microsoft. The Nuance Board of Directors authorized Nuance\nmanagement to schedule the additional meetings that Microsoft had requested.\nOn January 9, 2021, Microsoft and Nuance executed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did\nnot contain a standstill provision.\nDuring January 2021, representatives of Microsoft and Nuance held several virtual due diligence sessions, focused\non issues including technology, enterprise, go-to-market, financials and potential synergies.\nOn February 2, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting with members of Nuance senior\nmanagement, as well as representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss, attending. At the meeting, representatives of\nEvercore updated the Nuance Board of Directors on the discussions with Microsoft, and members of Nuance\nmanagement presented to the Nuance Board of Directors financial forecasts for Nuance for the 2021-2025 fiscal years,\nwhich are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201c"
