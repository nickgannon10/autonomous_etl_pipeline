The Merger Agreement contains\nrepresentations and warranties by, and covenants of, Heska, Acquiror and Merger Sub (and solely in connection\nwith providing a guaranty of Acquiror\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement, Mars) that were\nmade only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and\ncovenants in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be\nsubject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being modified and qualified by confidential\ndisclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead\nof establishing these matters as facts and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality or material adverse\neffect applicable to the contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition,\ninformation concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the\ndate of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Heska\u2019s public\ndisclosures. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you should not\nrely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual\nstate of facts or condition of Heska, Acquiror, Merger Sub or Mars.\nAdditional information about Heska may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Heska\u2019s other public\nfilings. See the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 95."
