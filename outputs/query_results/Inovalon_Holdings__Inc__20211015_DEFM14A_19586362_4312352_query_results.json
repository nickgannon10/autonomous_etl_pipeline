In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management will\noperate the Company\u2019s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today, and that the Company\u2019s stockholders will continue to be\nsubject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject.

            "Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\nPursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Company Board on August 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board that, as of such date and\nbased upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in\npreparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public\nStockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its August 18, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Company Board, dated August 19, 2021,\nthat, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public\nStockholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated August 19, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex D to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company\u2019s public common stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nopinion was addressed to the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger,\nwas directed only to the consideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as\nto the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion\nwas approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how\nsuch stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies J.P.\nMorgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies J.P.\nMorgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded\nsecurities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the Projections and Extrapolations\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of\nits opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and Parent with respect to certain aspects of\nthe Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the\nCompany, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was\nfurnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any\nsuch information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its\n42Table of Contents\nengagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not\nconduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or\nParent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P.\nMorgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses\nor forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also\nassumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions\nwith, and materials furnished to J.P. Morgan by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement and\npursuant to the certificate of incorporation. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the\nMerger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,\nregulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all\nmaterial governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse\neffect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.\nThe Projections and Extrapolations furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by the Company\u2019s management, as discussed more fully under \u201cCertain\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d The Company does not publicly disclose internal management Projections and Extrapolations of the\ntype provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the proposed Merger, and such Projections and Extrapolations were not\nprepared with a view toward public disclosure. These Projections and Extrapolations were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are\ninherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and\ncompetitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such Projections and\nExtrapolations. For more information regarding the use of Projections and Extrapolations and other forward-looking statements, please refer to the section\nentitled \u201cCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P.\nMorgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P.\nMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, of the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion\nas to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or\nother constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any\nclass of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger or with respect to\nthe fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company\u2019s common stock will trade at any future\ntime.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders, were determined\nthrough arm\u2019s length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the\nCompany Parent. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of\nthe proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or management with respect to the proposed\nMerger or the consideration, including the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s public common stockholders.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodologies in rendering its\nopinion to the Company Board on August 18, 2021 and in the financial analysis presented to the Company Board on such date in connection with the\nrendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion\nto the Company Board and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without\nconsidering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data for\nselected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged by the Company.\nThe companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:\n\u2022\nNICE LTD.\n\u2022\nPTC Inc.\n\u2022\nBlack Knight, Inc.\n\u2022\nGoDaddy Inc.\n\u2022\nDatto Holding Corp.\n\u2022\nQualys, Inc.\n\u2022\nMimecast Limited\n\u2022\nOmnicell, Inc.\n\u2022\nR1 RCM Inc.\n\u2022\nHealth Equity, Inc.\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, were considered in its judgment sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of the Company based on business\nsector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical or directly\ncomparable to the Company and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The\nanalyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies\ninvolved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect the Company.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of firm value to the Wall Street research analyst\nconsensus estimate of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d). Based on the results of this analysis and\nother factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 18.5x \u2013 24.0x. After applying such range to the\nprojected Adjusted EBITDA for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2022, the analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value\n(rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the common stock of the Company of $34.00 to $45.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the\nCompany common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the\nimplied per share consideration of $41.00.\nSelected Transaction Multiple Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses\nwhich J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s experience and familiarity\nwith the industries in which the Company operates (the \u201cJ.P. Morgan Selected Transactions\u201d). The following transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as\nrelevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:\nAnnouncement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nApril 23, 2021\nBlue Yonder Group, Inc.\nPanasonic Corporation\nApril 12, 2021\nNuance Communications, Inc.\nMicrosoft Corporation\nAugust 22, 2019\nCarbon Black, Inc.\nVmWare, Inc.\nJune 12, 2019\nMedidata Solutions, Inc.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes\nJune 10, 2019\nTableau Software, Inc.\nSalesforce.com, Inc.\nOctober 28, 2018\nRed Hat, Inc.\nInternational business Machines Corporation\nJune 19, 2018\nCotiviti Holdings, Inc.\nVerscend Technologies, Inc.\nJanuary 30, 2018\nCallidus Software Inc.\nSAP SE\nApril 26, 2021\nProofpoint, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nDecember 21, 2020\nRealPage, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nNovember 10, 2020\nPlanview Inc.\nTA Associates\nFebruary 6, 2020\nForescout Technologies, Inc.\nAdvent International\nOctober 14, 2019\nSophos Group plc\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nFebruary 4, 2019\nUltimate Software Group Inc.\nHellman & Friedman LLC\nFebruary 12, 2019\nEllie Mae, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, LLC\nNovember 11, 2018\nApptio, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners\n44\nTable of Contents\nNone of the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. Certain of these transactions may have\ncharacteristics that are materially different from those of the proposed Merger. However, the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions were chosen because\ncertain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily\ninvolve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other\nfactors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each J.P. Morgan Selected Transaction, the multiple of the target company\u2019s firm\nvalue implied in the relevant transaction to the target company\u2019s revenue for the next twelve-month period following announcement (the \u201cNTM\u201d) of the\napplicable transaction (the \u201cFV/NTM Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 7.0x to 11.0x. J.P. Morgan then\napplied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the NTM as of August 3, 2021. The analysis indicated a range of implied equity\nvalues per share (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $32.75 to $54.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company\ncommon stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per\nshare consideration of $41.00.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted\nequity value per share for the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate\nduring fiscal years 2021E through 2030E based upon the financial Projections and Extrapolations prepared by Company management (as set forth in the\nsection entitled \u201cCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, which was discussed with, and approved by, the Company Board for use by\nJ.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of this period by\napplying perpetual growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%, based on guidance provided by the Company\u2019s management and on J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nprofessional judgment and experience, to estimates of the unlevered terminal free cash flows for the Company at the end of fiscal-year 2030E, as provided\nin the Company management Projections and Extrapolations. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of\nterminal values to present value as of August 3, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00% for the Company, which range was chosen by J.P.\nMorgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and\nthe range of terminal values were then adjusted by subtracting net debt and other adjustments for the Company as of August 3, 2021.\nBased on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the Company common\nstock of $34.00 to $51.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the\nclosing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per share consideration of $41.00.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data\npresented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the\nanalyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were\nmerely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value\nof the Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan"
