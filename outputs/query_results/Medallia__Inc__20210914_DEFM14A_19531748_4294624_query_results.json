            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger\nagreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger\nagreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, and in its entirety because this summary may not\ncontain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the\nparties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other\ninformation contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Medallia, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms\nof the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those\ngenerally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential\nmatters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Medallia in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the\nrepresentations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating\ncontractual risk between Medallia and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may\nbe subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.\nFurther, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.\nOur stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of Medallia, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the\nmerger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the\nmerger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the\nrespective businesses of Medallia, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are\neither expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to\nby the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Medallia, Parent, Merger Sub or\ntheir respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the\nmerger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this\ndocument and in our filings with the SEC regarding Medallia and our business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second\nbusiness day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions\nthat by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of\nsuch conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by Medallia, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the\nmerger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided\nunder the DGCL. If, on or prior to October 27, 2021, all of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement have been\nand continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of\nwhich is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived, then Parent may delay the closing until November 1,\n2021. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a later time as\nmay be agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger."
