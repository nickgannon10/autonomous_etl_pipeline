            "Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger\nCompletion of the merger is subject to the condition that all consents and approvals of any governmental authority required to consummate the merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement shall have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting\nperiods in respect thereof shall have expired or been terminated. The merger also is subject to the condition that none of the required regulatory\napprovals shall impose a \u201cBurdensome Condition,\u201d which is defined in the merger agreement to mean any prohibition, limitation or other requirement that\nwould prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Meridian or any of its subsidiaries, or by Independent or any of its subsidiaries, of all or\nany material portion of the business or assets of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries or Independent or its subsidiaries, or compel Independent or any of\nits subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries or Independent or\nany of its subsidiaries.\n \n96Table of Contents\nThe consents and approvals of governmental authorities that Independent and Meridian have determined required to consummate the merger and the the\nmerger of East Boston with Rockland Trust (which is referred to in this document as the bank merger) include:\n \n \n\u2022\n the approval of or waiver of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the FDIC\u2019s approval under the Bank Merger Act\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the approval of the Massachusetts Division of Banks under relevant Massachusetts law (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 167I).\nIn order to consummate the bank merger, Independent and Meridian must also receive (1) confirmation from the Massachusetts Housing Partnership\nFund (which is referred to in this document as the Housing Partnership Fund) that Independent has made arrangements satisfactory to the Housing\nPartnership Fund\u037e and (2) confirmation from the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund (which is referred to in this document as the Massachusetts\nDIF) that arrangements satisfactory to the Massachusetts DIF have been made in connection with the termination of Massachusetts DIF deposit\ninsurance coverage for East Boston Savings Bank in excess of FDIC deposit insurance.\nFederal Reserve. Certain of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve pursuant to section 3\nof the Bank Holding Company Act. In considering the approval of a transaction such as the conversion to a bank holding company and the merger, the\nBank Holding Company Act, requires the Federal Reserve to review: (1) the competitive impact of the transaction, (2) the financial condition and future\nprospects, including capital positions and managerial resources, (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the record of the\ninsured depository institution subsidiaries of the bank holding companies under the Community Reinvestment Act (the \u201cCRA\u201d), (4) the effectiveness of\nthe companies and the depository institutions concerned in combating money-laundering activities, and (5) the extent to which the proposal would result\nin greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review, the Federal Reserve provides\nan opportunity for public comment on the application and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if they determine that such meeting\nor other proceeding would be appropriate.\nUnder the CRA, the Federal Reserve must take into account the record of performance of the companies and the depository institutions concerned in\nmeeting the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, served by such companies and depository\ninstitutions. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA by their primary federal supervisor and are assigned ratings.\nIn evaluating the record of performance of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served by the institution, the Federal\nReserve considers the institution\u2019s record of compliance with the CRA, including the most recent rating assigned by its primary federal supervisor. As of\ntheir last respective CRA examinations, Rockland Trust was rated \u201cOutstanding\u201d and East Boston was rated \u201cSatsifactory\u201d with respect to CRA\ncompliance.\nThe federal Bank Merger Act also mandates that the prior approval of the FDIC, the primary federal regulator of the resulting bank, is required to merge\nEast Boston Bank with and into Rockland Bank. In evaluating an application filed under the Bank Merger Act, the FDIC generally considers: (1) the\ncompetitive impact of the transaction, (2) financial and managerial resources of the banks party to the bank merger or mergers, (3) the convenience and\nneeds of the community to be served and the record of the banks under the CRA, including their CRA ratings, (4) the banks\u2019 effectiveness in combating\nmoney-laundering activities and (5) the extent to which the bank merger or mergers would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of\nthe U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review, the FDIC also provides an opportunity for public comment on the application and is\nauthorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if they determine it to be appropriate.\n \n97\nTable of Contents\nMassachusetts Division of Banks. Certain of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to approval by the Massachusetts\nDivision of Banks pursuant to Chapter 167I of the Massachusetts General Laws. In evaluating a merger application under these sections, the\nMassachusetts Division of Banks will review a proposed merger to determine whether competition among banking institutions will be unreasonably\naffected and whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted. In making such determination, the commissioner shall consider, at a minimum,\na showing of net new benefits. Net new benefits may include for example, initial capital investments, job creation plans, consumer and business services,\nand commitments to maintain and open branch offices within the continuing institution\u2019s assessment area.\nThe parties have filed or will file certain applications and notice materials necessary to obtain these regulatory approvals or confirmations in accordance\nwith applicable law. The merger cannot be completed until all the required approvals and confirmations have been obtained, are in full force and effect and\nall statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired, and the bank merger cannot be completed until after both approvals listed above have been\nobtained. The merger may not be consummated until 30 days after the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (or such shorter period as the Federal\nReserve Board may prescribe with the concurrence of the United States Department of Justice, but not less than 15 days), during which time the\nDepartment of Justice may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds. The bank merger may not be consummated until 30 days after the approval of the\nFDIC (or such shorter period as the FDIC may prescribe with the concurrence of the United States Department of Justice, but not less than 15 days),\nduring which time the Department of Justice may challenge the bank merger on antitrust grounds. The commencement of an antitrust action by the\nDepartment of Justice would stay the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve Board or FDIC approval, as the case may be, unless a court specifically orders\notherwise. In reviewing the merger and the bank merger, the Department of Justice could analyze the merger\u2019s effect on competition differently than the\nFederal Reserve Board and the FDIC, and it is possible that the Department of Justice could reach a different conclusion than the applicable banking\nregulator regarding the merger\u2019s (or the bank merger\u2019s) competitive effects.\nIndependent and Meridian cannot assure you that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained or\nwhether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals. Independent and Meridian also cannot assure\nyou that the United States Department of Justice or the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will not attempt to challenge the\nmerger on antitrust grounds, or what the outcome will be if such a challenge is made. Independent and Meridian are not aware of any other government\napprovals or actions that are required prior to the parties\u2019 consummation of the merger. It is currently contemplated that if any additional governmental\napprovals or actions are required, such approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any of the additional approvals or\nactions will be obtained.",
            "Conditions to Complete the Merger\nOur respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the fulfillment or waiver if legally permitted (except for the condition set forth in the third\nbullet below, which may not be waived in any circumstance) of mutual conditions, including:\n \n \n\u2022\n the requisite Independent vote and the requisite Meridian vote having been obtained\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this document is a part, with respect to the Independent common stock to be issued\nin the merger under the Securities Act and the absence of any stop order or proceedings initiated or threatened by the SEC or any other\ngovernmental authority for that purpose\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the receipt and effectiveness of all regulatory approvals, registrations and consents and the expiration or termination of all waiting periods\nrequired to complete the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the absence of any judgment, order, injunction or decree issued by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or\nprohibition preventing the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the absence of any\nstatute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree in effect by any court or other governmental authority that prohibits or makes illegal the\nconsummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the authorization for listing on NASDAQ of the shares of Independent common stock issuable pursuant to the merger, subject to official\nnotice of issuance\n \n \n\u2022\n the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger agreement as of the date on which the merger\nagreement was entered into and as of the date on which the merger is completed, subject to the materiality standards provided in the merger\nagreement (and the receipt by each party of an officers\u2019 certificate from the other party to such effect)\u037e\n \n115Table of Contents\n \n\u2022\n the performance by the other party in all material respects of all obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under\nthe merger agreement at or prior to the date on which the merger is completed (and the receipt by each party of an officers\u2019 certificate from\nthe other party to such effect)\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n receipt by such party of an opinion of legal counsel to the effect that on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or\nreferred to in such opinion, the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code..\nNeither Independent nor Meridian can provide assurance as to when or if all of the conditions to the merger can or will be satisfied or waived by the\nappropriate party.",
            "Employee Benefits Matters\nBenefit Plans\nThe merger agreement provides that following the closing date of the merger, Independent may choose to maintain any or all of Meridian\u2019s benefit plans\nin its sole discretion. If any Meridian benefit plan terminated for which there is a comparable Independent benefit plan of general applicability, those\nindividuals who are employees of Meridian and its subsidiaries and who continue as employees of Independent or any of its subsidiaries will be entitled\nto participate in the Independent benefit plan to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Independent or Rockland Trust. In addition,\ncontinuing Meridian employees who experience a qualifying termination of employment within one year following the effective time and who are not\notherwise covered by a contractual severance arrangement would be eligible, subject to the execution of a release of claims in favor of Rockland Trust, for\nseverance pay in a lump sum equal to the amount determined under the East Boston Amended and Restated Employee Severance Compensation Plan\n(subject to a minimum of eight weeks of base compensation).\nWith respect to the comparable Independent benefit plan, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and\nvacation entitlement (but not for accrual of benefits under any Independent benefit plan, including any post-retirement welfare benefit plan but excluding\nany severance, vacation and/or paid time off plans), service by a Meridian employee will be recognized to the same extent such service was recognized\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the merger under a comparable employee benefit plan in which such Meridian employee was a participant\nimmediately prior to the effective time, or, if there is no comparable employee benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the\nMeridian 401(k) plan immediately prior to the effective time of the merger to the extent applicable\u037e provided, however, that such service shall not be\nrecognized to the extent recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.\nIndependent will cause each benefit plan providing medical, health or dental benefits to continuing employees to waive any preexisting condition\nlimitations relating to any conditions that were covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of Meridian and its subsidiaries, use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to provide full credit for any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their\nbeneficiaries during the portion of the plan year prior to participation, and use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any waiting period limitation or\nevidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to the continuing employee, in each case to the extent the employee had\nsatisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the effective time of the merger for the plan year in which the effective time\nof the merger occurs.\nIndependent will continue to be obligated to perform all vested benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, continuing employees existing as of the\neffective time, as well as all employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or \u201cchange-in-control\u201d agreements, plans, or policies of East\nBoston."

As\nyou are aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we express no opinion or view as to any potential\neffects of such volatility on the Merger, the Company, or Independent and this Opinion does not purport to address potential developments in any such\nmarkets.

We provided advice to the Board with respect to the proposed Merger.

We did not solicit\nindications of interest with respect to a transaction involving the Company. This letter does not express any opinion as to the likely trading range of\nIndependent\u2019s stock following the Merger, which may vary depending on numerous factors that generally impact the price of securities or on the financial\ncondition of Independent at that time.

We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Independent or the\nability of the Company or Independent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.\nThe delivery of this opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Raymond James.\nRaymond James has been engaged to render financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed Merger and will receive a fee\nfor such services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Raymond James will also receive a fee upon the\ndelivery of this Opinion, which is not contingent upon the successful completion of the Merger or on the conclusion reached herein.
