You are encouraged to read\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was directed to the Special\nCommittee, in its capacity as such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger\nConsideration to be received by the Company\u2019s stockholders (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the\naggregate pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the relative merits of\nthe Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such\nalternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a\nrecommendation as to how the Company\u2019s stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting with respect to the Merger\nor any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information\nof QAD\u037e\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning\nQAD\u037e\nreviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of QAD (as more fully defined\nherein, the \u201cManagement Case\u201d) and certain extrapolations prepared with guidance from the\nmanagement of QAD (which were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by the\nmanagement of QAD) (as more fully defined herein, the \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d)\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of QAD with\nsenior executives of QAD\u037e\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Class A Common Stock\u037e\ncompared the financial performance of QAD and the prices and trading activity of the Shares with\nthat of certain other publicly traded companies comparable with QAD, and their securities\u037e\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition\ntransactions\u037e\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of QAD, Parent and their\nrespective financial and legal advisors\u037e\nreviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of June 27, 2021, a draft of the Equity Commitment\nLetter, substantially in the form of the drafted June 26, 2021, and certain related documents\u037e and\n40 \u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors\nas Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the\naccuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made\navailable to Morgan Stanley by QAD and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the\nFinancial Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting\nthe best currently available estimates and judgments of QAD\u2019s management of the future financial\nperformance of QAD. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such Financial Projections or the\nassumptions on which they were based.

For\npurposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s fully diluted equity\nvalue plus total debt, plus non-controlling interest, less cash and cash equivalents, and \u201cEBITDA\u201d as\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application\nof its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of (i) aggregate\nvalue to estimated revenue multiples and (ii) aggregate value to estimated EBITDA multiples, and applied\nthese ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for QAD. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan\nStanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as of June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day\nprior to the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt\nthe Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger).\nBased on the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis as provided by QAD\u2019s management, Morgan\nStanley calculated the estimated implied value per Share as follows:\n42 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPublic Trading Multiples\nSelected\nComparable \nQAD Multiple \nRanges\nImplied Value\nPer \nShare ($)\nCY 2021E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n51.56\u202f-\u202f95.79\nManagement Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n51.71\u202f-\u202f96.10\nCY 2022E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f5.5x\n55.31\u202f-\u202f95.28\nManagement Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f5.5x\n56.50\u202f-\u202f97.47\nCY 2021E AV / EBITDA\nStreet Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n30.63\u202f-\u202f54.30\nManagement Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n31.28\u202f-\u202f55.59\nCY 2022E AV / EBITDA\nStreet Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f25.0x\n36.64\u202f-\u202f56.40\nManagement Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f25.0x\n32.74\u202f-\u202f49.93\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to QAD. In evaluating the\ncomparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,\ngeneral business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are\nbeyond QAD\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on QAD\u2019s business\nand the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial\ncondition and prospects of QAD and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical\nanalysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using\ncomparable company data.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the\npotential future equity value of a company as a function of such company\u2019s estimated future revenue and\nEBITDA. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied\npresent value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity\nvalues per Share on a standalone basis for each of the Street Case and Management Case.\nTo calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized (i) calendar year 2023\nrevenue estimates and (ii) calendar year 2023 EBITDA estimates under each of the Street Case and\nManagement Case, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,\nMorgan Stanley applied a forward range of aggregate value to (i) estimated revenue multiples, and (ii)\nEBITDA multiples (based on the range of aggregate value to revenue and EBITDA multiples for the\ncomparable companies) to these revenue and EBITDA estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future\nimplied fully diluted equity value.\nIn each case, Morgan Stanley then added net cash to QAD\u2019s future implied aggregate value to reach a future\nimplied fully diluted equity value. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future implied fully diluted\nequity value by estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates provided by QAD\nmanagement) to calculate a per share price. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future\nshare price to June 30, 2021, at a discount rate of 8.1%, which rate was selected based on QAD\u2019s estimated\ncost of equity, which was arrived at by applying the capital asset pricing model, to calculate the discounted\nfully diluted equity value.\nBased on Calendar Year 2023\nSelected AV / \nEstimated\nRevenue \nMultiple Ranges\nImplied Value\nPer \nShare ($)\nEstimated Revenue\nStreet Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n53.26\u202f-\u202f97.33\nManagement Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n55.11\u202f-\u202f101.21\nEstimated EBITDA\nStreet Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n38.68\u202f-\u202f68.46\nManagement Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n38.02\u202f-\u202f67.14\n43 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of\na company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such\ncompany. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per Share based on a discounted\ncash flow analysis to value QAD as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the Street\nCase and Management Case for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described\nbelow.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as EBITDA less (1)\nstock-based compensation expense, (2) cash taxes, (3) capital expenditures, and plus or minus changes in net\nworking capital. Each of the Street Case and Management Case included extrapolations through calendar\nyear 2030 prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by QAD\u2019s management. The\nfree cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a mid-year convention, to present values as of\nJune 30, 2021, at a discount rate ranging from 7.1% to 9.1%, which discount rates were selected, upon the\napplication of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of QAD\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing model. Morgan\nStanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% as part of its analyses, with such rates selected upon\nthe application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value\nwas then adjusted for net cash and further adjusted for the net present value of net operating losses.\nBased on the outstanding Share on a fully diluted basis as provided by QAD\u2019s management, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated the estimated implied value per Share as follows:\nImplied Value\n"

While we believe that the\nfollowing description covers the material aspects of the Merger, the description may not contain all of the\ninformation that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully this entire document, including the\nMerger Agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the\nMerger. The following description is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Merger\nAgreement. You may obtain additional information without charge as described in the section titled \u201cWhere\nYou Can Find More Information.\u201d\nWe are asking our stockholders to consider and vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,\nsubject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company\nwith the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed,\nthe holders of Shares (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) will have the right to receive the\nMerger Consideration of $87.50 per Share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes,\nsubject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nBackground of the Merger\nQAD regularly evaluates strategies for improving its competitive position and enhancing stockholder value.\nAs part of these evaluations, the QAD Board has, from time to time, considered various strategic\nalternatives, such as public offerings, joint ventures, collaborations and business combinations, including a\npossible merger or sale of QAD. From time to time, prior to 2021, QAD received unsolicited indications of\ninterest from third parties.\nDuring 2019 and 2020, the QAD Board and senior management met from time to time with multiple potential\nfinancial advisors, including, among other firms, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, which we refer to as Morgan\nStanley, to receive market and industry updates, evaluate the financial advisors\u2019 capabilities, and to discuss\na potential review of strategic alternatives for QAD. No financial advisors were engaged.\nOn December 14, 2020, the QAD Board invited representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss with the QAD\nBoard the most recent developments in the software industry, equity markets, potential strategic alternatives\nand the general economy.\nOn February 9, 2021, the QAD Board and its legal counsel, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, which we refer to\nas Manatt, met to discuss, among other things, a potential review of strategic alternatives for QAD. In\nconnection with such discussion, a representative of Manatt provided the QAD Board with an overview of\nlegal considerations in connection with potential transactions, including the potential formation of a special\ncommittee. After discussion and deliberation, the independent members of the QAD Board determined to\nrequest that senior management of QAD meet with representatives of Morgan Stanley in order for such\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley to provide their views regarding recent developments in the software\nindustry and potential strategic options for the Company.\nOn February 18, 2021, Ms. Lopker, the President and founder of QAD, Mr. Anton Chilton, the Chief Executive\nOfficer of QAD, and Mr. Daniel Lender, the Chief Financial Officer of QAD, met with representatives of\nMorgan Stanley to review potential strategic alternatives for QAD. After such meeting, Messrs. Chilton and\nLender discussed the meeting with Mr. Peter van Cuylenburg, the chair of the QAD Board.\nOver the following days, after discussion and deliberation, the members of the QAD Board executed a\nunanimous written consent, effective as of February 21, 2021, to form the Special Committee, with Mr. van\nCuylenburg, Mr. Scott Adelson, Ms. Kathy Crusco and Mr. Lee Roberts as its members. The QAD Board\ndetermined each member of the Special Committee to be unaffiliated with, and otherwise independent from,\nMs. Lopker and to be otherwise independent and disinterested with respect to the Special Committee\u2019s\nmandate. The Special Committee was delegated the full power and authority of the QAD Board to review,\nevaluate and negotiate potential strategic alternatives, to engage its own advisors and to make a\n21 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nrecommendation to the QAD Board regarding any such transaction. The resolution also provided that the\nQAD Board would not recommend any potential transaction to QAD stockholders without a prior favorable\nrecommendation by the Special Committee.\nDuring this same period, members of the Special Committee recommended to Ms. Lopker that she retain\nindependent financial and legal advisors. Ms. Lopker also expressed to such members her willingness to\npursue a process, her openness to consider any type of transaction, and her preference for retaining an\nongoing stake in the Company.\nOn February 23, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Morgan Stanley to further evaluate\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s capabilities and to review Morgan Stanley\u2019s tentative proposed plan to reach out to third\nparties potentially interested in a transaction with QAD.\nOn February 24, 2021, Ms. Lopker retained Paul Hastings LLP, which we refer to as Paul Hastings, as legal\ncounsel to the Lopker Entities in connection with a potential transaction.\nOn March 1, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, at which the members discussed their review of, and\nmeetings with, various potential law firms that the Special Committee was considering for engagement as\nlegal counsel to the Special Committee.\nOn March 8, 2021, the Special Committee met and, after discussion and deliberation, approved the selection\nof Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, which we refer to as Paul, Weiss, as legal counsel to the\nSpecial Committee. The Special Committee selected Paul, Weiss based, in part, on its experience representing\nspecial committees in circumstances similar to that of the Special Committee. At this meeting, the Special\nCommittee also appointed Messrs. van Cuylenburg and Adelson as co-chairs of the Special Committee.\nOn March 9, 2021, the Special Committee provided Paul, Weiss an executed engagement letter formalizing\nPaul, Weiss\u2019s engagement as legal counsel to the Special Committee.\nOn March 15, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, attended by representatives of Paul, Weiss and\nMorgan Stanley, to discuss, among other topics, organizational matters to facilitate the Special Committee\u2019s\nreview and process. During this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee\na preliminary overview of potential strategic alternatives for QAD. Morgan Stanley also disclosed its\nrelationships with respect to several potential counterparties. Also during such meeting, representatives of\nMorgan Stanley confirmed that it had not performed any work or services for Ms. Lopker, nor had it provided\nany financial analysis regarding QAD to any third party. The members of the Special Committee and\nrepresentatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussions in an executive session.\nThereafter, and after further discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee determined to engage\nMorgan Stanley as its financial advisor, based in part, on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, expertise and\nreputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in QAD\u2019s industry, and its knowledge of\nQAD\u2019s business and affairs, with such engagement being formalized in a written engagement letter dated\nMarch 30, 2021.\nDuring the period from mid-March 2021 to early May 2021, at the direction of the Special Committee,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley contacted over 25 potential counterparties, including both potential\nstrategic counterparties and financial sponsors, to gauge their interest in potential transactions with QAD.\nDuring this period, QAD entered into 18 confidentiality agreements with interested parties. None of these\nconfidentiality agreements included any standstill provisions.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender, met with representatives of all\n18 parties that signed confidentiality agreements to provide background regarding QAD and its financial\nperformance.\nDuring the period from mid-March 2021 to early May 2021, the Special Committee held regular weekly\nmeetings with its advisors, including on March 22, March 29, April 5, April 12, April 19 and April 26, 2021. All\nmeetings included discussion among the members of the Special Committee with representatives of Paul,\nWeiss during an executive session. The Special Committee invited Messrs. Chilton and Lender to participate\nin certain portions of such meetings, and instructed Messrs. Chilton and Lender not\n22 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto have any discussions relating to information learned in a Special Committee meeting with anyone,\nincluding Ms. Lopker, without the permission of the Special Committee.\nOn May 3, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley, as well\nas Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to discuss status\nof the process and timeline for requesting preliminary indications of interest from the eight potential\ncounterparties who continued to show engagement in the process. After review and deliberation, the Special\nCommittee directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to send a process letter to such parties containing bid\ninstructions and procedures (the form of which was approved by the Special Committee) and to request\npreliminary indications of interest by May 11, 2021. Over the course of the following weeks, representatives\nof Morgan Stanley, together with Messrs. Chilton and Lender, continued to participate in due diligence\ndiscussions upon the request of the potential counterparties involved in the process.\nAlso on May 3, 2021, the Special Committee discussed with its advisors outreach to additional potential\ncounterparties. At the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley then proceeded\nto contact two additional potential counterparties, which we refer to as Party C and Party D, to gauge their\ninterest in participating in the process.\nOn May 10, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party C. Such confidentiality agreement\ndid not include any standstill provisions.\nOn May 11, 2021, on behalf of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley received written\npreliminary, non-binding indications of interest from two of the eight parties who had been sent a process\nletter, which indications were promptly provided to the Special Committee and its advisors. The two parties\nwho submitted preliminary indications of interest were Thoma Bravo and a party we refer to as Party B.\nThoma Bravo\u2019s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which QAD stockholders would\nreceive up to $90 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash\nconsideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Thoma Bravo\u2019s indication of interest\nindependently raised the possibility of Ms. Lopker continuing to hold a portion of her interests in QAD by\nrolling over a percentage of her holdings and also expressly stated that, in connection with its diligence,\nThoma Bravo representatives would require discussions with Ms. Lopker regarding her involvement in the\nCompany following the closing of the proposed transaction. Party B\u2019s indication of interest outlined a\npotential transaction in which QAD stockholders would receive approximately $86 per share in cash, subject\nto further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt\nand equity. Party B also verbally indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley its request to meet with Ms.\nLopker to discuss her involvement in the Company following the closing of the proposed transaction. Both\nThoma Bravo and Party B indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that they would each require a\nsupport agreement in connection with any transaction, which would require, among other things, that the\nLopker Entities vote in favor of the contemplated transaction (subject to certain exceptions) with the relevant\ncounterparty.\nFour of the eight parties that received the process letter expressed to representatives of Morgan Stanley\npotential interest in a transaction with QAD at a \u201clow-to-no premium\u201d value over the then-current publicly\ntraded price per share, but did not submit any indications of interest. The remaining two parties who had\nreceived a process letter expressed to representatives of Morgan Stanley potential interest in a private\ninvestment in public equity transaction with QAD, but did not submit indications of interest. On May 11,\n2021, QAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $67.30.\nOn May 12, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided to the Special Committee an updated\nrelationship disclosure letter with respect to Thoma Bravo and Party B, the two parties who submitted\npreliminary indications of interest.\nAlso on May 12, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan\nStanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to\ndiscuss the preliminary indications of interest received, the status of the process and potential next steps.\nThe Special Committee reiterated that Messrs. Chilton and Lender were not to have any discussions relating\nto information learned in a Special Committee meeting with anyone, including Ms. Lopker, without\n23 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe permission of the Special Committee, and added that no one other than members of the Special\nCommittee were to discuss the process or preliminary indications of interest with Ms. Lopker at that stage.\nThe members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussion during an\nexecutive session of the meeting. After review and deliberation, the Special Committee determined to seek\nadditional details from each of Thoma Bravo and Party B regarding their respective preliminary indications of\ninterest.\nOn May 13, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party\nC.\nOn May 14, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party D. Such confidentiality agreement\ndid not include any standstill provisions.\nAlso on May 14, 2021, Messrs. van Cuylenburg and Adelson met with Ms. Lopker to provide her with the\nhigh-level terms of the preliminary indications of interest received from each of Thoma Bravo and Party B.\nMs. Lopker indicated that she was interested in continuing to have a role in QAD following the closing of a\npotential transaction if one were to occur, and that she was open to discussions with each of Thoma Bravo\nand Party B about such role. Ms. Lopker indicated that she had not yet decided whether she would seek a\nrollover of a portion of her shares in QAD, but that she was leaning in favor of rolling a portion of her shares\nin QAD as part of a potential transaction.\nOn May 17, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,\nas well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee) to discuss\nthe overall status of the process, as well as a potential process for involving Ms. Lopker in certain\ndiscussions with Thoma Bravo, Party B, or other potential counterparties that may submit indications of\ninterest. Representatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed that, at the direction of the Special Committee, they\nwould schedule additional calls with Thoma Bravo and Party B to discuss further details of their respective\nindications of interest. At that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed status and\nfeedback received from the other potential counterparties involved in the process that did not submit\nindications of interest. After discussion and deliberation, representatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed that,\nat the direction of the Special Committee, they would request that any remaining parties in the process\nsubmit indications of interest by May 25, 2021. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of\nPaul, Weiss had further discussion during an executive session of the meeting.\nOver the course of the week of May 17, 2021, Messrs. Chilton and Lender, together with representatives of\nMorgan Stanley, continued to participate in due diligence discussions upon the request of potential\ncounterparties.\nOn May 19, 2021, and on May 21, 2021, Ms. Lopker had initial discussions with each of Party B and Thoma\nBravo, respectively, with representatives of Morgan Stanley present on behalf of the Special Committee, to\ndiscuss potential counterparties\u2019 plans for QAD and Ms. Lopker\u2019s potential involvement in QAD following\nthe closing of a potential transaction with each such counterparty. No discussion of any specific terms of\nsuch an arrangement, or a potential rollover of a portion of Ms. Lopker\u2019s shares in QAD, took place.\nFollowing these meetings, Ms. Lopker indicated to Messrs. Adelson and van Cuylenburg that she was open\nto further discussion with both of Thoma Bravo and Party B.\nOn May 21, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party\nD.\nOn May 25, 2021, of the seven potential counterparties who had been sent a process letter, Morgan Stanley\nreceived one additional written non-binding preliminary indication of interest, from two parties who\npartnered together, which we refer to collectively as Party E. Such indication of interest included a range of\n$80 to $82.50 per share, as well as a list of outstanding diligence items, and stated that any transaction would\nbe financed with a mix of debt and equity. Such indication of interest was promptly provided to the Special\nCommittee and its advisors.
