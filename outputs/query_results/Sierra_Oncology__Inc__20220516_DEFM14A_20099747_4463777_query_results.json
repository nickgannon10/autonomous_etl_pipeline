During such six-year period or such period in which an indemnified person is asserting a claim for indemnification\npursuant to the merger agreement, whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to\nany applicable indemnified persons except as required by applicable law.\nFurthermore, during the period commencing at the effective time of the merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the\nmerger, the surviving corporation has agreed to (and GSK has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, in accordance\nwith provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws or the other similar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of Sierra, as applicable, as of the date\nof the merger agreement, or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the\nmerger agreement, each indemnified person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees and investigation expenses),\njudgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil,\ncriminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such legal proceeding arises, directly or\n95Table of Contents\nindirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person\u2019s capacity as a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of Sierra or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action\nor omission, occurred prior to, at or after the effective time of the merger)\u037e and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by Sierra, GSK or Merger Sub\nwith respect to the merger (including any disposition of assets of the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the\nsurviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent).\nFurthermore, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the merger, any indemnified person delivers to GSK a written notice\nasserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to the merger agreement, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the\neffective time of the merger until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In connection with any legal proceeding of the type contemplated by the merger\nagreement, (A) the surviving corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the effective time of the merger\u037e (B) to the extent required\nin the applicable organizational documents or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with Sierra Oncology or any of its subsidiaries in effect as of\nthe date of the merger agreement, (1) the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by any indemnified person in connection with such legal proceeding\nwill be paid by the surviving corporation\u037e and (2) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified person to repay any amount if it is\nultimately determined that such indemnified person is not entitled to indemnification, the surviving corporation will advance all reasonable fees and\nexpenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) as incurred by an indemnified person in the defense of such legal proceeding, whether or\nnot the surviving corporation elects to control the defense of any such legal proceeding\u037e and (C) no indemnified person will be liable for any settlement\nof such legal proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the\nsurviving corporation is entirely responsible).\nDuring the period commencing at the effective time of the merger and ending on the sixth anniversary thereof, the surviving corporation will (and\nGSK will cause the surviving corporation to) maintain in effect the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to\nthe effective time of the merger on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of\nthe directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance in effect prior to the effective of the merger, subject to certain annual premium maximums described in the merger\nagreement. In lieu of the foregoing, prior to the effective time of the merger, Sierra Oncology may purchase a prepaid \u201ctail\u201d policy with respect to the\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance.

            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger agreement in this summary and\nelsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the\nmerger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information\nabout the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made only for\npurposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be\nsubject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Sierra Oncology, GSK and Acquisition Sub in connection\nwith negotiating the terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally\napplicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to GSK and Acquisition\nSub by Sierra Oncology in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the\nmerger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Sierra Oncology and GSK and Acquisition Sub rather than to establish\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement\nmay have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in\ncircumstance or otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of\nSierra Oncology, GSK or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing\nof the merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not\nrely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Sierra Oncology, GSK and Acquisition Sub because\nthe parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise\nconsented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and\nincluded as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual\ninformation regarding Sierra Oncology, GSK, Acquisition Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants\nand other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and\nin our filings with the SEC regarding Sierra Oncology and our business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or\nwaiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but\nsubject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by Sierra Oncology, GSK and Acquisition Sub. On the\nclosing date of the merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The\nmerger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a later time as may be agreed to in writing by the parties and\nspecified in such certificate of merger.\n80Table of Contents"
