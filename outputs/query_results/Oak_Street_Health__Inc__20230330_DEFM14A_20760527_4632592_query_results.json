Monroe Street, Suite 1200\nChicago, Illinois 60603\nThe Board of Directors:\nYou have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per\nshare (the \u201cShares\u201d) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of Oak Street Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), of $39.00 per\nShare in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger proposed to be entered into and\ndated as of February 7, 2023 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), by and among CVS Pharmacy, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (\u201cParent\u201d), Halo Merger Sub Corp., a\nDelaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), the Company and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein,\nCVS Health Corporation, a Delaware corporation and ultimate parent company of Parent (\u201cCVS\u201d). The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be\nmerged with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the \u201cTransaction\u201d), as a\nresult of which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective\ntime of the Merger (other than (i) each Share that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock or (B) owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries\n(including Merger Sub), in each case as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (ii) Shares subject to outstanding awards of Company\nRestricted Stock (as defined in the Agreement) and (iii) Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) (the Shares referred to in clauses (i),\nand (ii) and (iii), together with any Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, \u201cExcluded Shares\u201d)) will be converted into the right to receive\n$39.00 per Share in cash, without interest (the $39.00 per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the \u201cConsideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of\nthe Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our\nservices in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is\ncontingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us\nagainst certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.\nWe are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and\nmerchant banking activities. In the past two years, except for our current engagement in respect of the Transaction, we have not been engaged to provide\nfinancial advisory or other services to the Company, and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. We are currently\nengaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to a portfolio company of General Atlantic Service Company, LP (\u201cGeneral\nAtlantic\u201d) (affiliates of which own approximately 25% of the Shares), and we may receive compensation from such company in the future. In 2022, our\nrestructuring team was engaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to a portfolio company of General Atlantic in\nconnection with certain restructuring-related matters, and we received compensation from such company. In 2021, we were engaged to provide financial\nadvisory services to Landmark Health, LLC (\u201cLandmark Health\u201d) in connection with its sale to UnitedHealth Group, at which time General Atlantic was\nthe majority owner of Landmark Health, and we received compensation from Landmark Health forTable of Contents\nsuch services. In the past two years, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Parent or CVS, Parent\u2019s ultimate parent\nentity, and we have not received any compensation from Parent or CVS during such period. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or\nwith respect to the Company, Parent, CVS, General Atlantic or their respective affiliates, including portfolio companies of General Atlantic, in the future,\nfor which we may receive compensation. Certain (i) of our and our affiliates\u2019 directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such\npersons, (ii) of our affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial\ninterests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments\n(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, Parent, CVS, General Atlantic or any of their respective\naffiliates, including portfolio companies of General Atlantic, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.\nIn connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement dated February 7, 2023 (the \u201cDraft\nAgreement\u201d)\u037e (ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\u037e (iii) certain interim reports\nto stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company\u037e (iv) certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company\u037e (v) certain\nother communications from the Company to its stockholders\u037e and (vi) certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash\nflow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the Company prepared by\nmanagement of the Company and furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis (the \u201cForecasts\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cInternal Data\u201d).
