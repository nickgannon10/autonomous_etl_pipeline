For purposes of its\nanalyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized both the Financial Forecasts, described in the section above entitled \u201c\u2014Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d and third-\nparty research analyst consensus estimates as of December 9, 2022 (which are referred to as the \u201cstreet case\u201d). Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand\nthe financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth\nbelow without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential per-share present values\nfor Company common stock as of October 31, 2022 (which is the end of the Company\u2019s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance\nsheet date) by:\n \n\u2022\nadding:\n \n(a)\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows (which are referred to as the \u201cUFCF\u201d) of the\nCompany, based on the Financial Forecasts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027 (which implied\npresent value was calculated using a range of discount rates of 9.5% to 13.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of\ncapital for the Company)\u037e\n \n(b)\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of the Company, calculated by multiplying the Company\u2019s\nestimated UFCF in fiscal year 2028 of approximately $360 million, based on the Financial Forecasts (assuming a long-term cash tax\nrate of 15%, as provided by management of the Company), by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months\u2019\nestimated UFCF multiples of 20.0x to 32.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment and\nexperience), and discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above\u037e\n \n(c)\nthe cash and cash equivalents of the Company as of October 31, 2022, as provided by management of the Company\u037e and\n \n(d)\nthe implied net present value of estimated federal tax savings due to its net operating losses for the fiscal years 2028 and beyond,\nas provided by management of the Company, discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a)\nabove\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nsubtracting:\n \n(a)\nthe face value of the outstanding Convertible Notes as of October 31, 2022, and the Company\u2019s redeemable non-controlling\ninterests in Coupa K.K. (the Company\u2019s Japanese joint venture), as of October 31, 2022, as provided by management of the\nCompany\u037e and\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n63\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding (calculated using the\ntreasury stock method, taking into account the restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and in-the-money stock\noptions, as of December 8, 2022, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money Convertible Notes) as of October 31, 2022, and is\npro-forma for the net-share settlement of the outstanding capped calls related to the 2023 Convertible Notes due January 15, 2023, all as\nprovided by management of the Company, with each of the above-referenced estimated future UFCFs, terminal value and federal tax\nsavings due to net operating losses for the fiscal years 2028 and beyond having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution\nto current stockholders through each respective applicable period (which totaled approximately 13% in the case of the terminal value)\ndue to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of\nfuture dilution provided by management of the Company.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $40.30 to $79.42 per\nshare.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company with publicly available financial\ninformation and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in this comparison were those companies listed below, which\nwere selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of\nbusiness to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.\nBased upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of December 9, 2022 and using the closing prices as of December 9, 2022 for shares\nof the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus\nrevenue for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the \u201cCY2023E revenue multiples\u201d), for each of the selected companies, as shown below:\n \nSelected Companies\nCY2023E\nRevenue\nMultiple\nServiceNow, Inc.\n8.8x\nAdobe Inc.\n7.9x\nBlackLine, Inc.\n7.5x\nQualys, Inc.\n7.4x\nKinaxis Inc.\n7.1x\nWorkiva, Inc.\n6.9x\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc.\n6.8x\nWorkday, Inc.\n6.1x\nTenable Holdings, Inc.\n5.6x\nFive9, Inc.\n5.6x\nUiPath, Inc.\n5.1x\nBox, Inc.\n4.6x\nDocuSign, Inc.\n3.9x\nSalesforce, Inc.\n3.8x\nNew Relic, Inc.\n3.8x\nZoom Video Communications, Inc.\n3.8x\nQualtrics, LLC\n3.5x\nRingCentral, Inc.\n2.2x\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E revenue multiples for the selected companies and the application of its professional judgment, Qatalyst\nPartners selected a representative multiple range of 3.8x to 7.0x.\nQatalyst Partners then applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated revenue for calendar year 2023, based on the Financial Forecasts and based on\nthe street case. Based on the fully diluted shares of Company common stock\n \n \n64\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\noutstanding as of December 8, 2022 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above discounted cash flow analysis), this analysis\nimplied (a) a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $27.70 to $64.54 per share based on the Financial Forecasts for calendar\nyear 2023 and (b) a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $29.48 to $67.81 per share based on the street case for calendar year\n2023.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.\nMany of these matters are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s business or the industry in\ngeneral, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in\nthe financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is\nnot in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared fifty-one selected public company transactions, including transactions involving companies participating in similar lines\nof business to the Company or with similar business models, similar financial performance or other relevant or similar characteristics.\nFor each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the\ntarget company as a multiple of last-twelve-months\u2019 revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the \u201cLTM revenue multiples\u201d) and (b)\nthe implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-\nmonths\u2019 revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the \u201cNTM revenue multiples\u201d).\n \nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nLTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\n10/27/22\nUserTesting, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n6.2x\n5.3x\n10/12/22\nKnowBe4, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n14.9x\n11.4x\n10/11/22\nForgerock, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n10.5x\n8.4x\n09/28/22\nBTRS Holdings Inc.\nEQT X Fund\n9.7x\n7.9x\n08/08/22\nAvalara, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n10.5x\n8.7x\n08/03/22\nPing Identity Holding Corp.\nThoma Bravo\n8.9x\n8.0x\n06/24/22\nZendesk, Inc.\nHellman & Friedman LLC & Permira Advisers\nLLC\n6.8x\n5.4x\n06/06/22\nAnaplan, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n16.0x\n12.8x\n04/11/22\nDatto Holding Corp.\nKaseya Inc. & Insight Partners, LLC\n9.7x\n8.3x\n04/11/22\nSailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n15.7x\n13.3x\n12/07/21\nMimecast Limited\nPermira Holdings Limited\n10.0x\n8.8x\n12/01/21\nBlue Prism Group PLC\nSS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\n7.2x\n5.8x\n08/19/21\nInovalon Holdings, Inc.\nNordic Capital Limited\n10.0x\n8.8x\n08/05/21\nCornerstone OnDemand, Inc.\nClearlake Capital Group, L.P.\n6.3x\n5.9x\n07/26/21\nMedallia, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n13.0x\n10.8x\n06/28/21\nQAD Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n5.8x\n5.3x\n04/26/21\nProofpoint, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n10.8x\n9.4x\n03/10/21\nTalend S.A.\nThoma Bravo\n8.5x\n7.4x\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n65\nTable of Contents\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nLTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\n03/08/21\nPluralsight, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n9.8x\n8.4x\n12/21/20\nRealPage, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n9."
