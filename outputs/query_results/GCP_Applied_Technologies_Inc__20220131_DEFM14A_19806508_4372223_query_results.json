After giving effect to these adjustments, the financial projections provided to Saint-Gobain and Party\nA showed, for fiscal year 2021 (in millions), Net Revenue of $965, Adjusted Gross Profit of $347, Adjusted EBIT of $93 and Adjusted EBITDA of $139.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow calculated by RBCCM was not provided to Saint-Gobain and Party A.\n58Table of Contents\nGCP\u2019s ability to achieve the results set forth in the Management Projections are expressly dependent upon certain assumptions, including with respect to\nbroad trends in the construction chemicals and building materials industries and the continued impact of pandemic restrictions, cost inflation and supply\nchain disruptions. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included herein only because such\ninformation was made available as described above. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to comply with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the\nguidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.\nFurthermore, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accountant, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied\nprocedures to the Management Projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for them and expresses no opinion on them. The Management\nProjections included herein have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, GCP\u2019s management.\nAlthough a summary of the Management Projections is presented with numerical specificity, the Management Projections reflect numerous variables,\nassumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the Management\nProjections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to the Company\u2019s management at the time the Management Projections\nwere prepared. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important\nfactors that may cause actual results to deviate from the Management Projections include general economic conditions, results or financial condition,\nindustry performance, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, the continued\nimpact of pandemic restrictions, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions, accuracy of certain industry forecasts prepared by third parties,\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting our results, our contingent liabilities and tax matters\ncausing us to incur losses or costs, any inability to protect our intellectual property rights adversely affecting our business or our competitive position,\ncosts or adverse effects on our business, reputation or results from governmental regulations, failure to hire and retain employees, results or financial\ncondition, and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Management Projections do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nthe Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Management Projections.\nSince the Management Projections cover multiple years, that information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The inclusion\nof this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, GCP, our financial advisor or Saint-Gobain, or any of their respective\nrepresentatives and affiliates, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management Projections to be material\ninformation of GCP or that actual future results will necessarily reflect the Management Projections, and the Management Projections should not be relied\nupon as such. The summary of the Management Projections is not included herein to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or\nany of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the\nMerger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to shares of GCP common stock.\nThe Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements, risk factors and other information\nregarding GCP contained in our public filings with the SEC. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d on page 119 of this proxy statement.\nThe Management Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause GCP\u2019s future results to materially vary, see\n\u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 30 of this proxy statement.\nExcept to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to update or otherwise\nrevise the Management Projections to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even if the\nassumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be in error. By including in this proxy statement a summary of certain\n59\nTable of Contents\nfinancial projections, neither GCP nor any of its representatives or advisors, nor Saint-Gobain or any of its representatives and affiliates, makes any\nrepresentation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of GCP compared to the information contained in such financial projections and should\nnot be read to do so.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to unduly rely on the\nManagement Projections included herein.\nCertain of the measures included in the Management Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures as used by GCP may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies."
