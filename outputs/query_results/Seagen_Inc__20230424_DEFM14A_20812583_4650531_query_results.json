In particular, the merger agreement and this\nsummary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts and circumstances relating to\nSeagen or Pfizer. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of Seagen, Pfizer and Merger Sub that were made only\nfor purposes of the merger agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely\nfor the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with negotiating the terms of the\nmerger agreement (including by being qualified by the confidential disclosure letter exchanged between the parties to the merger agreement) and may be\nsubject to a contractual standard of materiality that may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors. In particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations\nand warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right\nnot to close the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and\nallocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. Information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the\nmerger agreement.\nAdditional information about Seagen may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Seagen\u2019s other public filings.
