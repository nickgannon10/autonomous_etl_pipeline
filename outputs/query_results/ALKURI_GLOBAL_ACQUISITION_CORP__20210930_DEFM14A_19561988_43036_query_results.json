            "ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nNOTE 1 \u2014 DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nAlkuri Global Acquisition Corp. (formerly known as Ark Global Acquisition Corp.) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December\n1, 2020. On March 5, 2021, Alkuri filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change its corporate name from Ark Global Acquisition\nCorp. to Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp., effective March 8, 2021. Alkuri was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange,\nasset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d).\nAlkuri is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, Alkuri is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth\ncompanies.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Alkuri had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from December 1, 2020 (inception) through\nDecember 31, 2020 relates to Alkuri\u2019s formation and the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d). Alkuri will not generate any operating\nrevenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. Alkuri will generate non-operating income on cash and cash\nequivalents in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\nThe registration statement for Alkuri\u2019s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 4, 2021. On February 9, 2021, Alkuri consummated\nthe Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the \u201cPublic\nShares\u201d), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating\ngross proceeds of $345,000,000, which is described in Note 3.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, Alkuri consummated the sale of 5,933,333 warrants (each, a \u201cPrivate Placement\nWarrant\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Ark Sponsor LLC\n(the \u201cSponsor\u201d), generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000, which is described in Note 4.\nTransaction costs amounted to $19,500,194, consisting of $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $525,194 of\nother offering costs.\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, an amount of $345,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the\nsale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a Trust Account, invested in U.S. government\nsecurities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended\ninvestment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), as determined by Alkuri, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the\ndistribution of the funds in the Trust Account to Alkuri\u2019s stockholders, as described below, except that the interest earned on the Trust Account can be\nreleased to Alkuri to pay its tax obligation.\nAlkuri\u2019s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of\nthe Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business\nCombination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value\nequal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest\nearned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. Alkuri intends to complete a Business\nCombination if the\nF-125Table of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\npost-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling\ninterest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nAlkuri will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the \u201cpublic stockholders\u201d) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their\nPublic Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business\nCombination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether Alkuri will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a\ntender offer will be made by Alkuri, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of\nthe amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust\nAccount and not previously released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business\nCombination with respect to Alkuri\u2019s warrants.\nAlkuri will proceed with a Business Combination only if Alkuri has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such\nconsummation of a Business Combination and, if Alkuri seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business\nCombination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and Alkuri does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, Alkuri will,\npursuant to its Charter (the \u201cAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however,\nstockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or Alkuri decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, Alkuri will\noffer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If Alkuri seeks\napproval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after\nthe Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares\nirrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or don\u2019t vote at all.\nNotwithstanding the above, if Alkuri seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the\ntender offer rules, the Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such\nstockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)),\nwill be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of\nAlkuri.\nThe Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the\ncompletion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if Alkuri fails to complete a Business\nCombination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Charter (i) to modify the\nsubstance or timing of Alkuri\u2019s obligation to allow redemption in connection with Alkuri\u2019s initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public\nShares if Alkuri does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial\nbusiness combination activity, unless Alkuri provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any\nsuch amendment.\nAlkuri will have until February 9, 2023 to complete a Business Combination (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d). If Alkuri is unable to complete a Business\nCombination within the Combination Period, Alkuri will (i) cease all\nF-126\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\noperations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the\nPublic Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the\nfunds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution\nexpenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as\nstockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such\nredemption, subject to the approval of Alkuri\u2019s remaining stockholders and Alkuri\u2019s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to\nAlkuri\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights\nor liquidating distributions with respect to Alkuri\u2019s warrants, which will expire worthless if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within the\nCombination Period.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within\nthe Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to\nliquidating distributions from the Trust Account if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have\nagreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event Alkuri does not complete a\nBusiness Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account\nthat will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets\nremaining available for distribution will be less than the Proposed Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to Alkuri if and to the extent any claims by a third\nparty for services rendered or products sold to Alkuri, or a prospective target business with which Alkuri has discussed entering into a transaction\nagreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the\nTrust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest\nwhich may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all\nrights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under Alkuri\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public Offering\nagainst certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Moreover, in the event that an executed\nwaiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.\nThe Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to\nhave all vendors, service providers (except Alkuri\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with\nwhich Alkuri does business, execute agreements with Alkuri waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust\nAccount.\nLiquidity and Management\u2019s Plan\nPrior to the completion of the initial public offering, Alkuri lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which\nis considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statement. The Company has since competed its Initial Public Offering at which time\ncapital in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to Alkuri for general working capital\npurposes. On March 26, 2021, Alkuri\u2019s cash position is approximately $315,000. On\nF-127\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nMarch 25, 2021, our Sponsor committed to provide us with an aggregate of $650,000 in loans. The loans, if issued, will be non-interest bearing, unsecured\nand will be repaid upon the consummation of a Business Combination. If Alkuri does not consummate a business combination, all amounts loaned to\nAlkuri will be forgiven except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the Trust Account to repay such loans. Accordingly, management has\nsince reevaluated Alkuri\u2019s liquidity and financial condition and determined that sufficient capital exists to sustain operations through for a reasonable\nperiod of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements and therefore substantial doubt has been alleviated.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus\ncould have a negative effect on Alkuri\u2019s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily\ndeterminable as of the date of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nNOTE 2 \u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business\nStartups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered\npublic accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive\ncompensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Alkuri\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a\ncondition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,\ncould change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nF-128\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The\nCompany did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs consisted of legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that were directly related to the\nInitial Public Offering. On February 9, 2021, offering costs amounting to $19,500,194 were charged to stockholders\u2019 equity upon the completion of the\nInitial Public Offering (see Note 1). As of December 31, 2020, there were $247,735 of deferred offering costs recorded in the accompanying balance sheet.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The Company complies with the accounting and\nreporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income\ntaxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that\nwill result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to\naffect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax\npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained\nupon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax\nexpense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020. The Company is currently\nnot aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments",
            "NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nAlkuri Global Acquisition Corp. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December 1, 2020. The Company was\nformed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business\ncombination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the\nCompany is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period ending June 30, 2021 relates to the Company\u2019s\nformation, the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a\ntarget company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business\nCombination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income on cash and cash equivalents in the form of interest income from the\nproceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\nThe registration statement for the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 4, 2021. On February 9, 2021, the Company\nconsummated the Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units\nsold, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at $10.00 per\nUnit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000, which is described in Note 3.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 5,933,333 warrants (each, a \u201cPrivate Placement\nWarrant\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Ark Sponsors\nLLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d), generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000, which is described in Note 4.\nTransaction costs amounted to $19,500,194, consisting of $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $525,194 of\nother offering costs.\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, an amount of $345,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the\nsale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d),\ninvested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or\nless, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a\nBusiness Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company\u2019s stockholders, as described below, except that the\ninterest earned on the Trust Account can be released to the Company to pay its tax obligation.\nThe Company\u2019s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the\nsale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a\nBusiness Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair\nmarket value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable\non interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company intends to\ncomplete a Business\nF-140Table of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nCombination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise\nacquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the \u201cpublic stockholders\u201d) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion\nof their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business\nCombination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or\nconduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a\npro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds\nheld in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion\nof a Business Combination with respect to the Company\u2019s warrants.\nThe Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon\nsuch consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the\nBusiness Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other\nreasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cAmended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation\u201d), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and file tender offer\ndocuments with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the\nCompany decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy\nsolicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks approval in connection with a Business\nCombination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of\napproving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or\nagainst the proposed transaction or don\u2019t vote at all.\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant\nto the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such\nstockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the\nPublic Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.\nThe Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the\ncompletion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business\nCombination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company\u2019s\ninitial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any\nother provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the\nopportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.\nThe Company will have until February 9, 2023 to complete a Business Combination (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d). If the Company is unable to\ncomplete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the\nF-141\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nCompany will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days\nthereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including\ninterest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of\ninterest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public\nstockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible\nfollowing such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company\u2019s remaining stockholders and the Company\u2019s board of directors, dissolve and\nliquidate, subject in each case to the Company\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other\napplicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company\u2019s warrants, which will expire worthless if the\nCompany fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination\nwithin the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to\nliquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The\nunderwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company\ndoes not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in\nthe Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share\nvalue of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Proposed Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a\nthird party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into\na transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share\nheld in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the\ninterest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any\nand all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public\nOffering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Moreover, in the event that an\nexecuted waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party\nclaims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by\nendeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses\nor other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or\nto monies held in the Trust Account.\nMerger Agreement\nOn June 3, 2021, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among the Company, Babylon Holdings Limited, Liberty USA\nMerger Sub, Inc. and, solely for purposes of Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement, each of Alkuri Sponsors LLC and Dr. Ali Parsadoust.

The Earnout Shares will be subject to milestones\n(based on the achievement of certain price targets of Pubco Class A shares following the Closing). In the event such milestones are not met, all of the\nEarnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Pubco which Pubco can redeem for $1.00.\nSubscription Agreements\nAdditionally, the Company and Babylon entered into subscription agreements, each dated as of June 3, 2021, with certain investors, pursuant to\nwhich, among other things, Babylon agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 23,000,000\nPubco Class A shares for $10 per share.

Holders of Alkuri public shares will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if they\ndeliver their shares to Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the special meeting. Holders of Alkuri public shares do not need\nto affirmatively vote on the Business Combination Proposal or be a holder of such Alkuri public shares as of the record date to exercise redemption\nrights. If the Business Combination is not consummated, these shares will not be redeemed for cash. If a holder of Alkuri public shares properly demands\nsuch redemption, delivers his, her or its shares to Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent as described above, and the Business Combination is consummated, Alkuri will\nredeem each Alkuri public share into a full pro rata portion of the trust account, calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the date of the special\nmeeting. It is anticipated that this would amount to approximately $10.00 per share. If a holder of Alkuri public shares exercises his, her or its conversion\nrights, then it will be redeeming its shares of Alkuri Common Stock for cash and will not become a shareholder of Babylon.\nAlkuri\u2019s Sponsor, officers and directors do not have redemption rights with respect to any Babylon Class A Shares owned by them, directly or\nindirectly.\nAlkuri requires public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to\nAlkuri\u2019s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the vote on the Business Combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent\nelectronically using Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option. There is a nominal cost\nassociated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will\ntypically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder.\nAny request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination. Furthermore,\nif a holder of an Alkuri public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote\non the Business Combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or\nelectronically).\nIf the Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then Alkuri Stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights\nwould not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account.

Alkuri has engaged Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies, and it will\npay such firm $37,500 plus disbursements for such services.\nOther Matters\nAs of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Alkuri board of directors does not know of any business to be presented at the special\nmeeting other than as set forth in the notice accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus. If any other matters should properly come before the special\nmeeting, it is intended that the shares represented by proxies will be voted with respect to such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons\nvoting the proxies.\nInterests of Alkuri\u2019s Officers and Directors in the Transactions\nIn considering the recommendation of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors to vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri\nStockholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in such proposal that are different from, or\nin addition to, those of Alkuri Stockholders generally. In particular:\n\u2022\nIf the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such\nlater date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming\n100% of the outstanding Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of\ndirectors, dissolving and liquidating. In such event, the Alkuri Securities held by the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and officers, which\nwere acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to\nparticipate in any redemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based\nupon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated,\neach outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private. This purchase took place on a private\nplacement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from these purchases were\nplaced in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $8,484,666 based upon the closing price of\n$1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants had an\naggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The private\nplacement warrants and the Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants will become worthless if Alkuri does\nnot consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an\namendment to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each outstanding whole warrant will\nbecome a Babylon warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation of the Business Combination and\neach outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under certain\ncircumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the\n116\nTable of Contents\ntrust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for\nservices rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri consummates a business combination, on the other hand, Alkuri will\nbe liable for all such claims.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them\nin connection with certain activities on Alkuri\u2019s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business\ncombinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have any claim\nagainst the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business Combination\nor another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an\namendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates had incurred\napproximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have agreed\nto purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the\nother PIPE Investors.\n\u2022\nUntil the first anniversary of Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will\nhave the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.\n\u2022\nThe Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers and the continuation of\ndirectors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the\nextent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.\nInterests of Babylon Holdings\u2019 Directors and Officers in the Business Combination\nIn considering the recommendation of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors in favor of the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, stockholders\nshould keep in mind that Babylon\u2019s directors and officers may have interests in such proposal that are different from, or in addition to, those of Alkuri\nStockholders and warrant holders generally. These interests include, among other things, the interests listed below:\n\u2022\nEntities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust, Babylon Holdings\u2019 Chief Executive Officer and chairman of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors,\nhave agreed to purchase 200,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and\nconditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth, member of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder\nof greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 share capital, and (ii) Georgi Ganev, member of Babylon",
            "ALKURI\u2019S BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nAlkuri was incorporated on December 1, 2020 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,\nrecapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Alkuri\u2019s efforts to identify a prospective\ntarget business were not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although it initially focused its search for target businesses on\ncompanies operating in the technology industry. Prior to executing the Merger Agreement, Alkuri\u2019s efforts were limited to organizational activities,\ncompletion of its initial public offering and the evaluation of possible business combinations.\nInitial Public Offering and Simultaneous Private Placement\nOn February 9, 2021, Alkuri closed the Alkuri IPO of 34,500,000 Alkuri units (after taking into account the full exercise of the over-allotment option\nby Alkuri\u2019s underwriters), with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one redeemable Alkuri Warrant, with\neach whole Alkuri Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share commencing 30 days\nafter the consummation of an initial business combination.\nFair Market Value of Target Business\nThe target business that Alkuri acquires must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust\naccount (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive\nagreement for its initial business combination, although Alkuri may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the\ntrust account balance. Alkuri\u2019s board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Babylon\nHoldings as described in the section entitled \u201cProposal One\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Satisfaction of 80% Test\u201d above.\nStockholder Approval of Business Combination\nUnder the SPAC Charter, Alkuri must seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which\npublic stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri public shares converted into cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed\nbusiness combination or do not vote at all, subject to the limitations described in the prospectus for the Alkuri IPO. Accordingly, in connection with the\nBusiness Combination, the Alkuri public stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri Common Stock converted to cash in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. See \u201cSpecial Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders\u2014Conversion Rights.\u201d\nVoting in Connection with the Stockholder Meeting\nIn connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, including the vote with respect to the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri\nStockholders prior to the Alkuri IPO and its officers and directors have each agreed to vote their Alkuri Common Stock in favor of such proposed\nBusiness Combination.\nAt any time prior to the special meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding Alkuri or its\nsecurities, the Alkuri initial stockholders, its officers and directors, Babylon shareholders and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares from\ninstitutional and other investors who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination Proposal, or execute agreements to\npurchase such shares from them in the future, or they may enter into transactions with such persons and others to provide them with incentives to\nacquire Alkuri Common Stock or vote their shares in favor of the Business\n183Table of Contents\nCombination Proposal. The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions would be to increase the likelihood of satisfaction of the requirement\nthat the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting to approve the Business Combination Proposal vote in its favor and that\nthe conditions to the Closing of the Business Combination otherwise will be met, where it appears that such requirements or conditions would otherwise\nnot be met. While the exact nature of any such incentives has not been determined as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, they might include,\nwithout limitation, include arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their shares, including the granting of put\noptions and the transfer to such investors or holders of shares for nominal value.\nEntering into any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on the shares of Alkuri Common Stock. For example, as a result of these\narrangements, an investor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to\nsell the shares he owns, either prior to or immediately after the special meeting.\nIf such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Business Combination to be approved in circumstances where such\napproval could not otherwise be obtained. Purchases of shares by the persons described above would allow them to exert more influence over the\napproval of the Business Combination Proposal and the other proposals to be presented at the special meeting and would likely increase the chances that\nsuch proposals would be approved. Moreover, any such purchases may make it more likely that the conditions to the Closing of the Business\nCombination are met.\nNo agreements dealing with the above arrangements or purchases have been entered into as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Alkuri\nwill file a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose any arrangements entered into or significant purchases made by any of the aforementioned persons that\nwould affect the vote on the Business Combination Proposal or the satisfaction of any closing conditions. Any such report will include descriptions of\nany arrangements entered into or significant purchases by any of the aforementioned persons.\nLiquidation if No Business Combination\nUnder the SPAC Charter, if Alkuri does not complete the Business Combination with Babylon or another initial business combination by February\n9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter), Alkuri will (i) cease all operations except for\nthe purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding\nAlkuri public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of Alkuri\u2019s remaining stockholders\nand its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to Alkuri\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for\nclaims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the Alkuri Warrants will expire. Holders of warrants will receive nothing\nupon a liquidation and the warrants will be worthless.\nEach of the initial stockholders of Alkuri and its officers and directors has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any distribution from Alkuri\u2019s\ntrust account or other assets with respect to the shares held by them prior to the Alkuri IPO. There will be no distribution from the trust account with\nrespect to Alkuri\u2019s warrants, which will expire worthless if Alkuri is liquidated.\nThe proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of Alkuri\u2019s creditors which would be prior to the claims\nof the Alkuri public stockholders. Although Alkuri has obtained waiver agreements from certain vendors and service providers it has engaged and owes\nmoney to, and the prospective target businesses Alkuri has negotiated with, whereby such parties have waived any right, title, interest or claim of any\nkind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, and although Alkuri will seek such waivers from vendors it engages in the future, there\nis no guarantee that they or other vendors who did not execute such waivers will not seek recourse against the trust account notwithstanding such\nagreements. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable under certain circumstances to pay debts and obligations to target\n184\nTable of Contents\nbusinesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to it, but Alkuri cannot\nensure that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally there are two exceptions to the\nSponsor\u2019s indemnity: the Sponsor will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has\nexecuted an agreement with Alkuri waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2)\nas to any claims under the indemnity with the underwriters of the Alkuri IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.\nMoreover, the Sponsor will not be liable to the Alkuri public stockholders and instead will only have liability to Alkuri. Furthermore, the Sponsor may not\nbe able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to as the Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of Alkuri and Alkuri has not taken any\nfurther steps to ensure that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Accordingly, the actual per-share redemption\nprice could be less than approximately $10.00, plus interest, due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an\ninvoluntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy\nlaw, and may be included in Alkuri\u2019s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of Alkuri Stockholders. To\nthe extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, Alkuri cannot assure you it will be able to return to the Alkuri public stockholders at least\napproximately $10.00 per share. Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders are entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of its failure to complete\na business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders properly seek to have Alkuri redeem their respective shares for cash upon a\nbusiness combination which is actually completed by Alkuri. In no other circumstances does a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in\nthe trust account.\nIf Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, any distributions received\nby stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor, creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent\nconveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by Alkuri Stockholders. Because Alkuri intends to distribute the\nproceeds held in the trust account to its public stockholders promptly after the expiration of the time period to complete a business combination, this may\nbe viewed or interpreted as giving preference to its public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from its\nassets. Furthermore, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors may be\nviewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to Alkuri\u2019s creditors and/or may be viewed as having acted in bad faith, which may subject Alkuri and\nAlkuri to claims of punitive damages. Alkuri cannot assure you that such claims will not be brought against it.\nAlkuri will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust account plus the up to $100,000 of interest\nearned on the funds in the trust account that Alkuri may use for liquidation and dissolution expenses.\nEmployees\nAlkuri has two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to Alkuri\u2019s matters and intend to\ndevote only as much time as they deem necessary to its affairs. Alkuri does not intend to have any full time employees prior to the Closing.\nFacilities\nUpon the Closing, the principal executive offices of Alkuri will be those of Babylon.\n185\nTable of Contents\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nAlkuri\u2019s current directors and executive officers are as follows:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nSultan Almaadeed\n31\nChairman\nRichard Williams\n46\nChief Executive Officer\nSteve Krenzer\n62\nChief Financial Officer\nStephen Smith\n50\nDirector\nJason Harinstein\n45\nDirector\nKatie May\n53\nDirector\nSultan Almaadeed, Chairman\nMr. Almaadeed is the Founder and CEO of ENVST, a technology-enabled investment platform that allows individuals to strengthen their networks\nwithin the global investing ecosystem as well as source and participate in attractive investment opportunities.
