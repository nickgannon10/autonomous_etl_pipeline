Morgan has confirmed its November 1, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written\nopinion to the Board, dated November 1, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the\nholders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nshareholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated November 1, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company\u2019s shareholders are\nurged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as\nsuch) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed merger, was directed only to the\nMerger Consideration to be paid in the proposed merger and did not address any other aspect of the proposed\nmerger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders of any other\nclass of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the\nCompany to engage in the proposed merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a fairness\ncommittee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as\nto how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the proposed merger with the publicly available financial terms of\ncertain transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for\nsuch companies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the Company\u2019s capital stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the internal financial forecasts and projections prepared by the management of the Company\nrelating to its business, which are summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Financial Projections\u201d\nbeginning on page 40 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the proposed merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed\nnecessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for\nindependently verifying) any such information or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was\nnot provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nthe Company, DuPont or the Merger Sub under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar\nmatters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan\nassumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the\nCompany to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts\nor the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the proposed merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement.\nJ.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, DuPont and Merger Sub in\nthe Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its\nanalysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the\nCompany with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other\nconsents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the proposed merger will be obtained without any\nadverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the proposed merger.\nThe projections furnished to J.P. Morgan and summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Financial Projections\u201d\nbeginning on page 40 of this proxy statement were prepared by the Company\u2019s management. The Company does not\npublicly disclose the internal management projections provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nanalysis of the proposed merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These\nprojections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the\ncontrol of the Company\u2019s management. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the\nprojections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please refer\nto the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Financial Projections\u201d beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed\nmerger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other\nclass of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or the underlying decision by the Company to\nengage in the proposed merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature\nof any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed merger, or any class of\nsuch persons relative to the Merger Consideration in the proposed merger or with respect to the fairness of any such\ncompensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company\u2019s capital stock will trade at\nany future time.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between the Company and DuPont, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely\nthat of the Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the\nBoard in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board\nor the Company\u2019s management with respect to the proposed merger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on November 1, 2021 and contained in the presentation delivered\nto the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The summary below does not purport to\nbe a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial\nanalyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmore fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text\nof each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the\nCompany with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses that J.P. Morgan judged to\nbe analogous to the Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., CMC\nMaterials, Inc., Entegris, Inc., FormFactor, Inc., Graco, Inc., Helios Technologies, Inc., Idex Corporation, II-VI, Inc.,\nIngevity Corporation, Littelfuse, Inc., Nordson Corporation, Quaker Chemical Corporation, Teledyne Technologies\nIncorporated, and Wolfspeed, Inc. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly\ntraded companies with operations and business that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses, may be considered\nsufficiently similar to those of the Company based on business sector participation, operational characteristics and\nfinancial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical to the Company and certain of these\ncompanies have financial and operating characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The\nanalyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently\nthan they would affect the Company.\nFor each of the selected companies, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of firm value to EBITDA based on publicly\navailable financial information and Wall Street estimates per FactSet Research Systems as of October 29, 2021 for the\n2022 calendar year (which we refer to as \u201cCY2022E FV / EBITDA\u201d). For each of the selected companies, J.P. Morgan\nalso calculated the price to earnings ratio based on publicly available financial information and Wall Street estimates\nper FactSet Research Systems as of October 29, 2021 for the 2022 calendar year (which we refer to as \u201cCY2022E P/E\u201d).\nBased on the results of these analyses and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a\nmultiple reference range of 12.0x to 20.0x for CY22E FV / EBITDA and a multiple reference range of 16.5x to 30.0x for\nCY22E P/E and applied these reference ranges to the CY2022E EBITDA and CY22E earnings per share, respectively,\nas provided by the Company\u2019s management in its management projections. This resulted in an implied equity value\nrange of $179.00 to $297.00 per share for the CY22E FV / EBITDA analysis and an implied equity value range of\n$142.00 to $259.00 per share for the CY22E P/E analysis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company,\ncompared, in each case, to (i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00 per share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital\nstock on October 29, 2021 of $201.12 per share.\nSelected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions\ninvolving companies that engaged in businesses that J.P. Morgan judged to be reasonably analogous to the\nbusiness of the Company or aspects thereof. None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the\nproposed merger. Certain of these transactions may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the\nproposed merger. However, the selected transactions were chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed merger. The analyses necessarily\ninvolve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of\nthe companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the\nproposed merger. For each of the selected transactions, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of the target company\u2019s firm\nvalue to the public estimates of EBITDA for the last 12-month period prior to the date of announcement (which we\nrefer to as \u201cLTM FV / EBITDA\u201d). Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:\nAnnouncement \nDate\nAcquiror\nTarget\nSeptember 2021\nMaterion Corporation\nHCS-Electronic Materials\nJuly 2021\nMKS Instruments, Inc.\nAtotech Limited\nJune 2021\nElement Solutions Inc.\nCoventya Holding SAS\nMarch 2021\nDuPont de Nemours, Inc.\nLaird Performance Materials\nApril 2019\nParker Hannifin Corporation\nLORD Corporation\nApril 2019\nMerck KGaA\nVersum Materials, Inc.\nAugust 2018\nCabot Microelectronics Corporation\nKMG Chemicals, Inc.\nJuly 2018\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nBOYD Corporation\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnouncement \nDate\nAcquiror\nTarget\nJune 2018\nEntegris, Inc.\nSAES Pure Gas\nMarch 2018\nAdvent International Corp.\nLaird PLC.\nOctober 2017\nBC Partners\nCeramTec GmbH\nApril 2017\nQuaker Chemical Corporation\nHoughton International Inc.\nApril 2017\nKMG Chemicals, Inc.\nFlowchem LLC\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a\nmultiple reference range of 11.0x to 19.5x for LTM FV / EBITDA, and applied this reference range to the LTM EBITDA\nfor the Company as of September 30, 2021, which includes Silicone Engineering, as provided by the Company\u2019s\nmanagement in its management projections. This resulted in an implied equity value range of $139.00 to $245.00 per\nshare (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company, compared to (i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00\nper share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital stock on October 29, 2021 of $201.12 per share.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of\ndetermining the implied fully diluted equity value per share for the Company\u2019s capital stock. J.P. Morgan calculated\nthe unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate from Q4 2021 through 2026 based upon\nfinancial projections prepared by the management of the Company, which are summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger-Financial Projections\u201d beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of\nterminal asset values of the Company at the end of the six-year period ending in 2026 by applying a perpetual growth\nrate ranging from 4.0% to 5.0% of the unlevered free cash flow of the Company during the terminal year of the six-\nyear period. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal asset values were then discounted to present\nvalues using a range of discount rates from 9.0% to 10.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an\nanalysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free cash flows\nand the range of terminal asset values were then adjusted for the Company\u2019s net cash of $43 million. Based on the\nresults of this analysis, J.P. Morgan arrived at a range of equity values of between $202.00 and $330.00 per share (in\neach case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company\u2019s capital stock on a stand-alone basis (i.e., without\nsynergies).\nOther Information.\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, J.P. Morgan\nreviewed the trading range for Company capital stock for the 52-week period ended October 29, 2021. J.P. Morgan\nnoted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $116.00 and $214.00 per share of Company\ncapital stock, respectively.\nAnalyst Price Targets for the Company. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, J.P.\nMorgan reviewed certain publicly available equity research analyst share price targets adjusted to present value\nassuming a cost of equity of 10.5% for Company capital stock, and noted that the range of such price targets,\nrounded to the nearest $1.00, was $204.00 to $253.00 per share of Company capital stock, in each case, as compared to\n(i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00 per share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital stock on October 29, 2021\nof $201.12 per share.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the\nforegoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of\nthe processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual"

In reaching its recommendation, the Board focused on a number of factors,\nincluding the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration of $277.00 per share in cash to be received by the Company\u2019s\nshareholders represented a significant premium across a number of measuring periods, including a premium\nof 33% over the $208.23 closing price of the Company\u2019s capital stock on November 1, 2021 (the last trading\nday prior to the public announcement of the merger) and a 46% premium to the one-month volume\nweighted average share price of $189.74\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the certainty provided by the acquisition of the Company by Parent for $277.00 per\nshare in cash was more favorable to Company shareholders than the potential risk-weighted value of\nremaining an independent public company, which belief was informed by its evaluation of the Company\u2019s\nshort-, medium- and long-term prospects were it to remain an independent public company and pursue its\ngrowth strategy, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such strategy, including those\ninherent in the Company\u2019s inflecting growth opportunities (including resources, capacity expansion and\nhistoric capital and operational expenditures) and the current and prospective business environment in\nwhich the Company operates, including international, national and local economic conditions and the\ncompetitive and regulatory environments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, based on the historical and projected financial information concerning the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, financial performance and condition, results of operations, earnings, competitive position and\nprospects as a stand-alone company and the Board\u2019s assessment that the merger would be favorable to the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration would be paid solely in cash, which provides certainty of value and\nimmediate liquidity to Company shareholders upon the consummation of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of the risks to the Company\u2019s business,\noperations, assets, operating results, financial condition, competitive position, and industry on the trading\nprice of the Company\u2019s capital stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe extensive negotiations between the Company and Parent over price, including the fact that the\nCompany was able to obtain as a result of such negotiations a 15.4% increase in the price per share from\nthe initial Parent proposal at $240.00 per share to the final price of $277.00 per share, and the Board\u2019s belief\nthat the $277.00 per share price represented the highest price per share that Parent was willing to pay for\nthe Company\u2019s capital stock, considering the due diligence conducted by Parent and the negotiations\nbetween the parties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, based on consultation with its financial advisors, that the negotiations with Parent had\nresulted in a transaction price, taking into account the Company\u2019s forecasts, at or above the upper end of\napplicable valuation methods and that undertaking broader outreach to third parties, which could prove\nunsuccessful, would raise undue risk to the Company of potential loss of competitively sensitive\nconfidential information and key personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nthe financial analyses of J.P. Morgan and its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board\nthat, as of November 1, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions set forth in its opinion, the\nMerger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the shares of Company capital stock in the proposed\nmerger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders, as more fully described in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-"
