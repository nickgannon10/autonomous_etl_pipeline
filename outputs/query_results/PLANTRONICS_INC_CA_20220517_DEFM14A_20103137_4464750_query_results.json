A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an\namendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, action by\nits board of directors or the duly authorized designee of its board of directors.\nARTICLE IX",
            "SECTION 8.02 Effect of Termination.\n(a) Any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.01 will be effective (subject to the cure periods provided above) immediately upon\nthe delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other parties of a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01. In the event of\nthe valid termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01, there shall be no liability or further obligation on the\npart of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Representatives\u037e provided, however that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to\nthe contrary, this Section 8.02 shall survive such termination and the following shall also survive such termination: Section 6.02 (penultimate sentence\nonly), Section 6.08, and Article IX\u037e and provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any willful and\nmaterial breach of, or fraud with respect to, any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement occurring prior to\nsuch termination. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the date\non which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto (unless any provision therein\nearlier terminates in accordance with the terms thereof).\n(b) The Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent a fee of $66,000,000 (the \u201cTermination Fee\u201d) if: (i) Parent terminates this\nAgreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)\u037e (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)\u037e (iii) a Takeover Proposal (whether or not\nconditional and whether or not withdrawn) has been made to the Company or to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise\nbecome publicly known and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) Section 8.01(b)(i) or (y) Section 8.01(c) and (B) within 12 months\nof such termination the Company or any Company Subsidiary consummates any Takeover Proposal or enters into a definitive agreement providing for\nany Takeover Proposal (in each case, whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same as the original Takeover Proposal made or communicated or that\nbecame publicly known prior to such termination)\u037e or (iv) a Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) has been made\nto the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant\nto Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (B) within 12 months of such termination the Company or any Company Subsidiary consummates any Takeover Proposal or\nenters into a definitive agreement providing for any Takeover Proposal (in each case, whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same as the original\nTakeover Proposal made or communicated or that became publicly known prior to such termination). Solely for purposes of clauses (iii) and (iv) of the\nfirst sentence of Section 8.02(b): (I) the term \u201cTakeover Proposal\u201d shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in\nSection 5.02(e) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed to be references to 50%\u037e and (II) in the event that a \u201cTakeover Proposal\u201d is a transaction\ndescribed in clause (i) of the definition of \u201cTakeover Proposal\u201d and one or more Company Subsidiaries is a party to (but the Company is not a party to)\nsuch a transaction, then clause (i) of the definition of \u201cTakeover Proposal\u201d, as it relates to a Company Subsidiary consummating or entering into a\ndefinitive agreement providing for a Takeover Proposal, shall instead be deemed to read \u201cfor a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business\ncombination, dual listed company structure, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, strategic alliance, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar\ntransaction involving more than 50% of the revenues or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis\u201d.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.02 or\nelsewhere in this Agreement, in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b) at a time when Parent would have\nhad the right to terminate this Agreement and would have been (or would have become) entitled to receive the Termination Fee as a result of such\ntermination, then Parent shall be entitled to receipt of the Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had\nParent terminated this Agreement at such time.

Notwithstanding anything in the contrary to this\nAgreement, in no event will the Company be required to pay more than one Termination Fee, collectively, or be required to pay the Termination Fee on\nmore than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at\ndifferent times and upon the occurrence of different events.\nSECTION 8.03",

            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger agreement in this summary and\nelsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the\nmerger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about\nthe merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement,\nand not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made only for\npurposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be\nsubject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Poly, HP and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating\nthe terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to\nreports and documents filed with the SEC and from those applicable to investors, and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to\nHP and Merger Sub by Poly in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the\nmerger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Poly and HP and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts.\nFurther, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the\nmerger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a\nchange in circumstance or otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on\nthe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of\nPoly, HP or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations\nand warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger,\nand, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not rely on the\ncovenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Poly, HP and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain\nactions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate\nparty, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to\nprovide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Poly, HP, Merger\nSub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should not\nbe read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Poly and our\nbusiness. Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or\nwaiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but\nsubject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time as agreed to in writing by Poly and HP.
