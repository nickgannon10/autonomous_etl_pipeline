Accordingly, the Board\nrecommends that stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.\nIn reaching their decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and to recommend that Ping Identity\nstockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board and the Transaction Committee considered the\nfollowing positive reasons to support the Merger Agreement:\nthe fact that the price of $28.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate\nvalue and liquidity to Ping Identity stockholders\u037e\nthe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Ping Identity\ncommon stock, including the fact that the $28.50 per share to be received by Ping Identity\nstockholders in the Merger represents a premium of approximately 63% over the closing price per\nshare as of August 2, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger, and\napproximately 52% over the volume weighted average price per share for the 60 days ending August\n2, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger\u037e\nthe current and prospective business environment in which Ping Identity operates, including\ninternational, national and local economic conditions, the current environment in the enterprise\nidentity security industry, and the likely effect of these factors on Ping Identity and the execution of\nPing Identity\u2019s plans as a standalone public company\u037e\nthe fact that Ping Identity is undergoing a Software as a Service and platform transformation and is\nsubject to market challenges and unpredictability in connection with such transition, as well as\nincreased exposure to variability in GAAP accounting results which could expose investors to\nincreased volatility in trading prices\u037e\nthe belief that the $28.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to Ping Identity\nstockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives\nreasonably available to Ping Identity, based upon the directors\u2019 extensive knowledge of Ping\nIdentity\u2019s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, the challenges completing\nthe cloud transformation in the current macro-economic environment, Ping Identity\u2019s historical and\nprojected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger represented an\nattractive and comparatively certain value for Ping Identity stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted\nprospects for

losing the favorable opportunity with Thoma Bravo in the event Ping Identity\nsought to pursue discussions with other third parties who may be interested in pursuing a strategic\ntransaction with Ping Identity prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential negative\neffect that such a process might have on Ping Identity\u2019s business\u037e\nthe business reputation, experience, expertise and capabilities of Thoma Bravo, and its strong track\nrecord of investing in high-growth cloud software security business and supporting companies with\ninitiatives to turbocharge innovation and open new markets\u037e\nthe belief that, after negotiations with Thoma Bravo and its representatives (as described in more\ndetail under the section titled \u201c- Background of the Merger\u201d), $28.50 per share was the highest price\nthat Thoma Bravo was willing to pay as of the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and that\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to Ping Identity, in the\naggregate, to which Thoma Bravo would be willing to agree\u037e\nthe belief that, if Ping Identity did not enter into the Merger Agreement with Thoma Bravo, there\ncould be a considerable period of time before the trading price per share of Ping Identity\u2019s common\nstock would reach and sustain the per share merger consideration of $28.50, as adjusted for present\nvalue (even assuming full realization of the management projections)\u037e\nthe oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written\nopinion dated August 2, 2022, to the effect that, as of August 2, 2022, and based upon and subject to\nthe various assumptions set forth therein, the per share consideration of $28.50 in cash to be paid to\nthe holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Ping Identity common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully described\nunder the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c-"
