The original complaint generally\nalleged, among other things, that certain subsidiaries of Terminix violated the non-compete restriction under\nthe licensee\u2019s license agreement and the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. As\nsupplemented, the Bruce Lawsuit further generally alleges, among other things, that a Rentokil Initial\nsubsidiary currently competes in the licensee\u2019s territory and that the transaction would violate the non-\ncompete restriction under the licensee\u2019s license agreement. The Bruce Lawsuit also alleges, among other\nthings, that Bruce would suffer irreparable harm from purported competition with Rentokil Initial should the\ntransaction be consummated, and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from\nmerging with Rentokil Initial so long as Rentokil Initial owns pest control companies with locations within\nBruce\u2019s service area and from disclosing to Rentokil Initial certain confidential or proprietary information of\nthe Company. On August 1, 2022, the court denied Bruce\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the\ntransaction. Terminix believes that the claims asserted in the Bruce Lawsuit are without merit.\nIn connection with the transaction, three complaints have been filed by purported Terminix stockholders\nagainst Terminix and its directors, and one draft complaint has been sent to Terminix. The complaints are\ncaptioned Ferreiro v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-04987 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e Justice v. Terminix\nGlobal Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-05519 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e and Baker v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc., et\nal., No. 1:22-cv-05524 (S.D.N.Y.). The draft complaint is captioned Paxton v. Terminix Global Holdings, Inc.,\net al. and does not specify any court. The complaints and draft complaint generally allege that the\npreliminary registration statement filed with the SEC on June 7, 2022 omitted certain allegedly material\ninformation in connection with the transaction in violation of federal proxy laws, and one of the complaints\nfurther alleges that the Terminix directors further breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the\ntransaction and that Terminix aided and abetted that breach. The lawsuits seek various remedies, including:\nenjoining the consummation of the transaction\u037e rescission of the transaction, or rescissory damages in the\nevent the transaction is consummated without the allegedly material disclosures\u037e declaring the merger\nagreement unenforceable\u037e directing dissemination of additional allegedly material disclosures\u037e declaring that\nTerminix and its directors violated federal proxy laws\u037e awarding plaintiffs costs and an allowance for\nattorneys\u2019 and experts fees\u037e and an accounting to the plaintiffs for any damages allegedly suffered. Given the\nearly stage of the proceedings, it is impossible to predict the outcome or to estimate possible loss or range of\nloss. Rentokil Initial and Terminix believe that the claims asserted in the complaints and draft complaint are\nwithout merit.",

In 2021,\nRentokil Initial introduced a new system to track its chemical usage across its top 20 operating countries.\nThis greater analysis will enable Rentokil Initial to target reductions in those chemicals that have the greatest\nenvironmental impact. Rentokil Initial currently estimates that, if it is able to develop new, more sustainable\nsolutions for use in fumigation, it will have reduced GHG emissions from fumigation by 70% by 2030.\nRentokil Initial believes it is leading the pest control industry in targeting these alternatives, which are often\nsafer to use as well as less carbon-intensive.\nProperties\nAs of December 31, 2021, Rentokil Initial leases executive offices in Gatwick, United Kingdom and operates\n1,650 facilities in 64 countries. Rentokil Initial\u2019s major research and development facilities are based in the UK\nRentokil Initial believes its existing properties are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of its business for\nthe foreseeable future.

Rentokil\nInitial relies on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality\nprocedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property and\nproprietary rights.\nRentokil Initial owns various service marks, trademarks and trade names, such as Rentokil, Initial, Ambius,\nSteritech, Western Exterminator, Ehrlich, Anderson and Presto-X, that it deems particularly important to its\nadvertising activities. As of December 31, 2021, Rentokil Initial owned approximately 53 registered U.S.\ntrademarks, six pending U.S. trademark applications, 1,047 registered foreign trademarks and eight pending\nforeign trademark applications. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, Rentokil Initial owned approximately\n14 issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, 16 nationalized E.U. patents, 227 issued foreign\npatents and seven pending foreign patent applications.\nRentokil Initial may not be able to obtain protection for its intellectual property, and its existing and future\ntrademarks, patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights may not provide it with competitive\nadvantages or distinguish its products and services from those of its competitors.

Additionally, Rentokil Initial\u2019s current and future trademarks, patents,\ncopyrights and other intellectual property rights may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or\ninvalid, and Rentokil Initial may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or\notherwise violating them.

For more information, see \u201cRisk Factors - \nRisks Related to Rentokil Initial\u2019s Business - Rentokil Initial may not be able to adequately protect its\nintellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to its business.\u201d\nRegulatory Compliance\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business is subject to various international, provincial and local laws and regulations,\ncompliance with which increases its operating costs, limits or restricts the services provided or the methods\n245 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nby which its business offers, sells and fulfills those services or conducts business, or subjects it to the\npossibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject\nRentokil Initial to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business is subject to various laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and\nsafety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the\nenvironment, the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances\nand wastes, the impact of chemicals, as well as pesticide and biocide products, on human health and safety\nand the environment, and the protection of the health and safety of Rentokil Initial\u2019s colleagues. These laws\nalso impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and\npast releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites Rentokil\nInitial currently owns or operates. These laws and regulations can result in costs associated with\ntransporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines, penalties,\norders requiring corrective action or suspending or otherwise impacting Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations or other\nsanctions if it is found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of\ncertain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Changes in such laws\nand regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations, could impact the sales\nof some of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and\ndelivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions\nto Rentokil Initial\u2019s business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should it be unable to\nmeet the demands of its customers for products or services. Environmental and regulatory matters most\nsignificant to Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations are discussed below.\nPesticide and Biocide Legislation. Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations\ngovern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. Rentokil Initial provides services utilizing certain\ndisinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria,\nviruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such\nproducts constitute \u201cpesticides\u201d or \u201cantimicrobial pesticides\u201d under the current definitions of the Federal\nInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\u201cFIFRA\u201d), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of\n1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides.\nRentokil Initial maintains product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d).\nRegistration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay\nongoing registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and\npayment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by\nFIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and\nCalifornia imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state.\nIn Europe, the Biocidal Products Regulation (\u201cBPR\u201d) establishes a program to evaluate and authorize\nmarketing of biocidal active substances and products. BPR requires the use of only approved biocides in\nRentokil Initial\u2019s products imported to or used in the European Union. Compliance with these regulations\n(and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere, such as the United Kingdom, Australia,\nChina, Russia, Turkey, Korea, and other countries) may require registration, notification, or certification\nregarding regulated substances, imposition of import restrictions, or in certain cases the redesign or\nreformulation of Rentokil Initial\u2019s products.\nIn addition, some of Rentokil Initial\u2019s operations involve the application of restricted-use pesticides that it\ngenerally purchases from third parties. Those operations must comply with certain standards pertaining to\nthe use of such pesticides and to the licensing of colleagues who apply such pesticides. Such regulations\nare enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations.\nU.S. Federal and State Chemicals Regulations. The primary chemicals management law in the United States, the\nToxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d), was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the\nFrank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (\u201cLCSA\u201d) in 2016. The LCSA modernizes the\noriginal 1976 legislation, aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in\ncommerce, improve the EPA capability and authority to regulate existing and new\n246 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nchemical substances, and prevent further state action or other notification programs like REACH (see below).\nThe TSCA changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the United\nStates. In addition, the EPA likely will be more aggressively using the existing TSCA tools to manage\nchemicals of concern. Certain states have their own chemical regulations, such as California\u2019s Proposition 65,\nwhich requires businesses to provide warnings to California residents about significant risk of exposures to\nchemicals in products that are known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.\nREACH. The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and\nAuthorization of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d), which aims to manage chemical safety risks. REACH established a\nEuropean Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine\nhazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe.\nIn addition, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and other countries are implementing similar requirements.\nGHS. In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical\nproducts known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (\u201cGHS\u201d).\nGHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals\nthrough a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates\ninformation about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets (\u201cSDSs\u201d). Most\ncountries in which Rentokil Initial operates adopted GHS-related legislation by 2021. The primary cost of\ncompliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels.\nFDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements. Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state,\nlocal and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured, used and sold by Rentokil Initial for\ncontrolling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements\ngenerally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). However, the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to\nfood. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety\nand effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including\nproposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional\nrequirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the\nFDA. FDA regulations associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act may impose additional\nrequirements related to safety product lines.\nOther Environmental Legislation. Rentokil Initial is subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws\nand regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the\ntransportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary U.S. federal statutes that apply to\nRentokil Initial\u2019s activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act. It is also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of\n1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air,\nland and water. Under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\nof 1980, and analogous state statutes, Rentokil Initial could be liable for contamination at current or former\nowned, leased or operated properties or at sites to which it sent wastes for disposal. Liability under these\nstatutes can be imposed on a joint and several basis and without regard to fault or the legality of the\nunderlying conduct.\nRentokil Initial cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental laws on its operations. Changes in,\nor new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously\nunknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, may\nlead to additional compliance or other costs.\nData Privacy\nRentokil Initial is required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and\nstandards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. In\nthe U.S., Rentokil Initial is, or may become, subject to numerous federal, state and local data privacy and\nsecurity laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security,\ntransfer, storage and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy laws,\ndata breach notification laws, and data disposal laws.

Regional, full-service companies provide service solutions, either direct or through\ncleaning companies or facility managements, differentiating on services, products and coverage. In several\nmarkets, washroom requirements can be met by facilities management or cleaning companies directly, but this\nsolution does not typically provide the same standard as provided by washroom services companies. Key\ninternational competitors include: PHS Group Inc. (based in the UK), Elis (based in France), CWS (based in\nGermany), Citron Hygiene Canada Limited (based in Canada) and Ecolab Inc. (based in the U.S.) in hygiene\nservices\u037e Kimberly-Clark Corporation (based in the U.S.) in hygiene consumables and products\u037e and Mitie\nGroup plc (based in the UK) in facilities management provision. The principal methods of competition in\nRentokil Initial\u2019s business include quality and speed of service, brand awareness and reputation, technology\nand systems, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, professional sales forces, contractor network\nand referrals.\nWorkwear (France)\nRentokil Initial\u2019s Workwear (France) segment specializes primarily in the supply and laundering of workwear,\nuniforms, cleanroom garments and personal protective wear in France. Rentokil Initial\u2019s strategy in Workwear\n(France) is aimed at creating a business that has a clear market differentiation through the highest level of\nproduct and service quality by focusing on rigorous application of key performance indicators to measure\nquality of service, using radio-frequency and identity tags to improve service accountability, utilizing\nhighest standards in washing and repair quality (including quality of detergents), being responsive to\ncustomer needs, dedicating a separate team to focus on innovation of services and products and leveraging\nexisting supply chain, research and development, processing, sales and marketing from the Pest Control and\nHygiene & Wellbeing segments.\nHuman Capital Management\nRentokil Initial employs approximately 46,000 colleagues in 88 countries, excluding contractors.

Over the past seven years Rentokil Initial\u2019s safety performance has\nimproved consistently, with its Lost Time Accident (\u201cLTA\u201d) rate improving from 2.06 in 2008 to 0.38 in 2021,\nthe lowest LTA rate ever achieved. Listening to colleagues\u2019 opinions has been a bedrock of Rentokil Initial\u2019s\nculture. In 2021, Rentokil Initial undertook Your Voice Counts, a global, confidential survey providing every\ncolleague with the opportunity to give feedback on workplace culture, leadership, customer focus,\ndevelopment and line manager performance. With a record high response rate of 91%, Rentokil Initial\nmaintained high levels of colleague engagement (80%) and colleague enablement (83%), and 25 questions\nsaw improvements in their scores over pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Strong improvements were made with\ncolleagues feeling informed about news concerning Rentokil Initial and its overall strategic direction. In\nparticular, scores for equal opportunities came in 10% higher than the global high-performance norm of\nleading companies.\nRentokil Initial is a diverse organization by its nature, operating in 88 countries and across 40 languages.\nRentokil Initial has strived, and will continue to strive, to ensure that its local businesses reflect the\ncountries, markets and communities in which they operate and to create an environment where everyone\u2019s\nview is heard, everyone\u2019s contribution matters and everyone has equal opportunities to succeed.

In support of this strategy, in 2021 Rentokil Initial\ndeployed a global diversity, equality and inclusion upskilling initiative to managers and leaders. The program\nfeatured two elements: \u201cInclude,\u201d where sessions focused on how to foster an inclusive environment, and\n\u201cDecide,\u201d which focused on bias and how to mitigate it. In 2021, approximately 1,000 managers and leaders\nparticipated in this program, with highly positive feedback. In June 2021, Rentokil Initial reviewed and\nupdated its Group Diversity, Inclusion & Equality Policy to further strengthen its focus on equality. This\npolicy is published internally on the Rentokil Initial intranet and externally on its corporate website.\nIn 2021, Rentokil Initial\u2019s U+ courses were viewed 4.3 million times (compared to 3.2 million in 2020, a 34%\nincrease), and more than 500 new pieces of learning content, including videos and courses, were created by\nan in-house content development team. This equates to an average of 107 content views per colleague\nthroughout 2021, up from 79 views per colleague in 2020 (an increase of 26%) with each colleague completing\na U+ training course on average every two working days during 2021.

This was created using funds from RI Cares, together with a voluntary salary waiver by the Chief\nExecutive Officer of 65% of his salary for the second quarter of 2020 (having already waived 35% as part of\nRentokil Initial\u2019s response to the pandemic), together with salary or director\u2019s fee waivers by\n243 \n",
