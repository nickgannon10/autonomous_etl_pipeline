LLC",
            "Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters\nThe obligations of Globus and NuVasive to consummate the Merger are subject to, among other conditions, the expiration or earlier termination of\nany waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act.\nUnder the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting period requirements have expired or\nbeen terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a notification and report form with the Antitrust Division of the United States\nDepartment of Justice (which we refer to as the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d). A transaction\nnotifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective\nnotification and report forms. If the Antitrust Division or the FTC issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (a \u201cSecond\nRequest\u201d) prior to the expiration of this initial 30-calendar-day waiting period, the transaction cannot close until the parties observe a second 30-calendar-\nday waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless such second waiting\nperiod is terminated earlier. The parties filed their respective notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR Act on March 3, 2023. Unless extended or\nearlier terminated, the 30-calendar-day waiting period under the HSR Act will expire on April 3, 2023.\nAt any time before the Effective Time, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the\nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any state could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public\ninterest with respect to the Merger, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally approve the\nMerger upon the divestiture of assets, or to impose restrictions on the operations of NuVasive or Globus following the completion of the Merger. Private\nparties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that the Merger will not be\nchallenged on antitrust grounds or, if such a challenge is made, that the challenge will not be successful.\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Globus and NuVasive have agreed to use their respective reasonable best\nefforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to cause their respective directors, executive officers and other representatives to take, all actions, to file, or\ncause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or\nadvisable under applicable law to consummate and make effective the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as\nsoon as reasonably practicable, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations,\napprovals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods from governmental bodies and making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all\nsteps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a\nwaiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental body in connection with any applicable law\u037e (ii) obtaining all\nnecessary consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties\u037e (iii) defending any lawsuit or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or\nadministrative, brought by any governmental body or third party challenging the Merger Agreement or seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or\nmake illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and contesting any order that enjoins,\nrestrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding, resolving any objections of or challenge made by any governmental body or third party to the merger or any other transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement under any antitrust law\u037e (iv) refraining from taking any other action that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere\nwith, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger\u037e and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate\nthe Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\n \n-108-Table of Contents\nIn furtherance of and consistent with Globus\u2019s obligation to use its reasonable best efforts, Globus has agreed to take, and to cause to be taken, all\nactions and things necessary, proper or advisable to eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law that is asserted by any governmental\nbody, to obtain the consent or cooperation of any other person, and to permit and cause the satisfaction of the closing relating to the expiration or earlier\ntermination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act and the absence of legal restraints against the Merger, in each of the\nforegoing cases, to permit the closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, including:\n \n\u2022\nnegotiating,

            "VOTING AGREEMENT\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on February 8, 2023, Globus and NuVasive entered into the Voting Agreement with the\nSupporting Stockholders. The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Voting Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as\nAnnex B and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The description of the Voting Agreement in this section and elsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Voting Agreement.\nVoting Commitment. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, until the earliest to occur of (a) the Effective Time, (b) a Globus Adverse Recommendation\nChange, (c) receipt of the approval of Globus stockholders for the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, and (d) such date and time as the Merger Agreement\nis validly terminated (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cExpiration Time\u201d), at every meeting of Globus stockholders at which the Globus Share\nIssuance Proposal is to be voted on (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and on any action or approval of Globus stockholders by\nwritten consent with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, the Supporting Stockholders are required to vote all of their shares of Globus\nCommon Stock in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board as of the time of the Globus Special Meeting with respect to the Globus\nShare Issuance Proposal. Even though a special meeting is required to be held and all Globus stockholders of record on the Globus Record Date have a\nright to vote on the proposals presented at the Globus Special Meeting, the shares of Globus Class B Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement will\nbe sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.\nUntil the Expiration Time, at every meeting of Globus stockholders (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), the Supporting\nStockholders are required to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting (or cause the holders of record on any applicable record date to be\nrepresented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Supporting Stockholders\u2019 shares of Globus Common Stock to be counted as present\nfor purposes of establishing a quorum.\nAs of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the shares of Globus Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement represent\napproximately 70% of the total voting power of outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock and therefore such shares of Globus Common Stock are\nsufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.\nTransfer Restrictions. Until the Expiration Time, the Supporting Stockholders have agreed not to directly or indirectly transfer any of their shares of\nGlobus Common Stock, other than (i) with the prior written consent of NuVasive, or (ii) (a) to any member of their immediate family, or to a trust for the\nbenefit of the Supporting Stockholders or any member of their immediate family, or otherwise for estate planning purposes, (b) by will or under the laws of\nintestacy upon their death or (c) pursuant to a qualified domestic order\u037e provided, however, that the transfers described in clause (ii) are only permitted if\nthe transferee agrees in a written document, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to NuVasive, to be bound by all of the terms of the Voting\nAgreement.\nRegulatory Support. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger Agreement, the Supporting Stockholders are\nrequired to use their reasonable best efforts to assist and cooperate in obtaining the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any\nextension thereof) under the HSR Act, and have agreed not to take any action which would limit, impair or delay Globus in taking any action or making\nany commitment or otherwise complying with its regulatory efforts covenant set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described in the section of this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Approvals\u201d). The Supporting Stockholders are not required to divest or agree to\nany restriction on any Globus Common Stock held by the Supporting Stockholders.\nNon-Solicitation. Until the Expiration Time, the Supporting Stockholders have agreed not to take any action that Globus is prohibited from taking\nunder the non-solicitation restrictions applicable to it under the Merger\n \n-142-Table of Contents\nAgreement (or permit any entity under their control to take such actions), as described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation.\u201d\nTermination. The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate and will have no further force or effect as of the Expiration Time, except that the\nobligations described above under \u201cRegulatory Support\u201d will continue until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger\nAgreement.\nExclusive Remedy. The Voting Agreement provides that NuVasive\u2019s right to receive the one-time payment of the Globus Termination Fee (as\ndefined in the section titled \u201cMerger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees and Expenses\u201d) pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement will\nbe the sole and exclusive remedy available to NuVasive or any of its former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or\nrepresentatives against Globus or the Supporting Stockholders or any of Globus\u2019s respective former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers,\naffiliates, agents or representatives with respect to the Voting Agreement or any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Supporting Stockholders\ncontained in the Voting Agreement, and, upon such payment of the Globus Termination Fee, (i) in no event may NuVasive or any of its former, current or\nfuture equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or representatives seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on\na claim in law or equity with respect to any breach, termination or failure of or under the Voting Agreement and (ii) none of Globus or the Supporting\nStockholders or any of Globus\u2019s former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or representatives will have any further\nliability relating to or arising out of the Voting Agreement. NuVasive has expressly waived the right to seek specific performance of the Supporting\nStockholders\u2019 obligations or covenants under the Voting Agreement and has agreed not to seek any injunction, order or other equitable remedy with\nrespect to the performance of the Supporting Stockholders\u2019 obligations under the Voting Agreement or the voting of their shares of Globus Common\nStock.\n \n-143-\nTable of Contents"

            "Vote of NuVasive Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of March 24, 2023, the NuVasive Record Date, NuVasive directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote in the\naggregate shares of NuVasive Common Stock, which represented less than 1% of the NuVasive Common Stock issued and outstanding on the NuVasive\nRecord Date.\nNuVasive currently expects that all NuVasive directors and NuVasive executive officers will vote their shares \u201cFOR\u201d the NuVasive Merger Proposal,\n\u201cFOR\u201d the NuVasive Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal, although none of them has entered into any agreements\nobligating them to do so.\n \n-49-Table of Contents\nMethods of Voting\nStockholders of Record\nIf you are a NuVasive stockholder of record, you may vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting by proxy through the internet, by telephone, by mail, or\nby virtually attending and voting at the NuVasive Special Meeting via the NuVasive Special Meeting website, as described below.\n \n\u2022\nBy Internet: Go to the web address www.proxypush.com/NUVA and follow the instructions for internet voting as shown on the notice\nmailed to you. Your vote must be received before the polls close at the NuVasive Special Meeting to be counted. If you vote via the internet,\nyou do not need to return a proxy card by mail.\n \n\u2022\nBy Telephone: Dial (866) 217-7017 and follow the instructions for telephone voting shown on the proxy card mailed to you.\n \n\u2022\nBy Mail: If you received a proxy card in the mail, and you do not wish to vote via the internet or by telephone, you can complete, sign, date\nand mail the proxy card in the envelope provided. If you vote via the internet or by telephone, please do not mail your proxy card. If you\nvote by mail, your completed proxy card must be received prior to the NuVasive Special Meeting.\n \n\u2022\nVirtually via the NuVasive Special Meeting Website: You may vote during the virtual meeting by following the instructions available on the\nNuVasive Special Meeting website at www.proxydocs.com/NUVA. To be admitted to the NuVasive Special Meeting, you must register by the\nRegistration Deadline and provide the Control Number as described in the proxy card. After completion of your registration by the\nRegistration Deadline, further instructions, including a unique link to access the NuVasive Special Meeting, will be emailed to you. We\nrecommend you submit your vote by proxy prior to the date of the NuVasive Special Meeting even if you plan to attend the meeting\nvirtually via the internet.\nUnless revoked, all duly executed proxies representing shares of NuVasive Common Stock entitled to vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting will be\nvoted at the NuVasive Special Meeting and, where a choice has been specified on the proxy card, will be voted in accordance with such specification. If\nyou submit an executed proxy without providing instructions for any proposal, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the NuVasive Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe NuVasive Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal. NuVasive does not expect that any matter other than the\nproposals listed above will be brought before the NuVasive Special Meeting.\nBeneficial (Street Name) Stockholders\nIf your shares of NuVasive Common Stock are held through a broker (typically referred to as being held in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you will receive separate\nvoting instructions from your broker. You must follow the voting instructions provided by your broker in order to instruct your broker on how to vote\nyour shares. Stockholders who hold shares in street name should generally be able to vote by returning the voting instruction form to their broker or by\ntelephone or via the internet. However, the availability of telephone or internet voting will depend on the voting process of your broker. If you hold\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee and intend to vote your shares online during the NuVasive Special Meeting, you must\nrequest and obtain a valid legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and register to attend the NuVasive Special Meeting as a stockholder at\nwww.proxydocs.com/NUVA. See the section titled \u201cStockholders of Record.\u201d\nRevocability of Proxies\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the NuVasive Special Meeting by: (a) providing new\nvoting instructions by telephone or via the internet as described above\u037e (b) delivering a proxy revocation or another duly executed proxy bearing a later\ndate to the Secretary of NuVasive at NuVasive\u2019s principal executive offices located at 12101 Airport Way, Broomfield, CO 80021\u037e or\n \n-50-\nTable of Contents\n(c) voting during the NuVasive Special Meeting by following the instructions available on the NuVasive Special Meeting website. Attendance at the\nNuVasive Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy unless you actually vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting. If you beneficially hold shares in street\nname, you must contact the broker or other nominee holding your shares and follow their instructions to change your vote or revoke your proxy.\nProxy Solicitation Costs\nNuVasive is soliciting proxies on behalf of NuVasive and the NuVasive Board. NuVasive will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from NuVasive\nstockholders. Proxies may be solicited on behalf of NuVasive or the NuVasive Board by NuVasive directors, officers and other employees in person or by\nmail, telephone, facsimile, messenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic communication. NuVasive directors, officers and\nemployees will not be paid any additional amounts for their services or solicitation in this regard.\nNuVasive will request that banks, brokers and other nominee record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of NuVasive\nCommon Stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. NuVasive may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and other nominees on\nrequest for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.\nNuVasive has also retained Innisfree to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with NuVasive stockholders and estimates that it will pay\nInnisfree a fee of approximately $80,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. NuVasive also has agreed to indemnify Innisfree\nagainst various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).\nHouseholding\nSEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and notices with respect to\ntwo or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This\nprocess, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d provides cost savings for companies. NuVasive has previously adopted householding for\nNuVasive stockholders of record. As a result, NuVasive stockholders with the same address and last name may receive only one copy of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. Registered NuVasive stockholders (those who hold shares of NuVasive Common Stock directly in their name with NuVasive\u2019s\ntransfer agent) may opt out of householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending a written\nrequest to NuVasive at the address below.\nSome brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple NuVasive stockholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be\nhouseholding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you\nno longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple\ncopies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.\nIf you reside at the same address as another NuVasive stockholder and wish to receive a separate copy of the applicable materials, you may do so\nby contacting the bank, broker or other holder of record, or NuVasive by telephone at: (858) 210-2129 or by mail to: 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego,\nCalifornia 92121, Attn: Investor Relations Department. Upon written or oral request, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of the notice of the NuVasive\nSpecial Meeting and, if applicable, the proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these\ndocuments.\n \n-51-\nTable of Contents\nAdjournments\nIf a quorum is present at the NuVasive Special Meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the NuVasive Special Meeting to approve the\nNuVasive Merger Proposal, then NuVasive stockholders may be asked to vote on the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, the\nholders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, may adjourn the NuVasive Special Meeting, from time to time,\nwithout notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. The NuVasive Special Meeting may also be adjourned\nto another place, if any, date or time, even if a quorum is present.\nAt any subsequent reconvening of the NuVasive Special Meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have\nbeen transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the\nNuVasive Special Meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened\nmeeting.\nAssistance\nIf you need assistance voting or completing your proxy card, or if you have questions regarding the NuVasive Special Meeting, please contact\nInnisfree, NuVasive\u2019s proxy solicitor for the NuVasive Special Meeting, at:\n \nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, New York 10022\nStockholders may call toll free: (877) 456-3524 \nBanks and Brokers may call collect: (212) 750-5833 \nNUVASIVE STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR\nMORE DETAILED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER.
