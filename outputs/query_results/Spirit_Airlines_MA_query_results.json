With\nrespect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of Spirit management of the future financial performance of Spirit. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions,\nincluding, among other things, that the definitive merger agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan\nStanley.

In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit, and did not\nsolicit, interest from any party with respect to any acquisition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving Spirit. Morgan Stanley\ndid not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby\nor any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith.\nMorgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor.

The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses performed\nand factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or\nweight given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any analysis described below. Considering any portion of such analyses and factors considered, without considering all\nanalyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Some of these summaries of\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables\nmust be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Furthermore,\nmathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to below.\nFor purposes of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the analyses described below, and with the consent of Spirit management, Morgan Stanley has assumed\nthat the merger consideration is $33.50 per share in cash.\n57\nTable of Contents\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or\nbefore July 26, 2022, the last trading day prior to the date of the meeting of the Spirit board of directors at which Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,\nand is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Capitalization information for Spirit, including fully-diluted number of shares and balance\nsheet information, was provided on July 25, 2022 by Spirit management to Morgan Stanley, and was approved by Spirit management for Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nuse in its financial analyses.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and relied upon the Spirit Financial Forecasts,\nas more fully described in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, which were approved by Spirit management for\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s use in connection with its financial analyses.\nPublic Trading Benchmark Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading benchmark analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for Spirit with comparable publicly available\nconsensus equity analyst research estimates for selected companies that, in Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment, share certain similar business\ncharacteristics with and have certain comparable operating characteristics, including, among other things, product characteristics, similarly sized revenue\nand/or revenue growth rates, market capitalization, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics, to those of Spirit (which companies\nare referred to as the comparable companies) (which we refer to as the \u201cSpirit Consensus Forecasted Financial Information of Spirit\u201d). JetBlue was\nincluded in the group of comparable companies.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of adjusted enterprise value (which we refer to as \u201cAdj. EV\u201d), which Morgan Stanley\ndefined as fully diluted market capitalization plus total debt, including capitalized operating lease liabilities, plus preferred stock, plus non-controlling\ninterest, less cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities and short term investments), to EBITDAR, which Morgan Stanley defined as\noperating income plus depreciation, amortization and rent expense plus addbacks for certain one-time costs, in each case estimated for the calendar year\n2023, which ratio Morgan Stanley referred to as 2023E Adj. EV / EBITDAR. Morgan Stanley also analyzed the ratio of price per share as of July 26, 2022 to\nearnings per share estimated for the calendar year 2023, which ratio Morgan Stanley referred to as 2023E P / E. The Spirit (Unaffected) market data was as\nof February 4, 2022 (the unaffected date for Spirit\u2019s share price, reflecting the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Frontier merger\nagreement). The Spirit (JETS Adjusted) market data was as of February 4, 2022 (the unaffected date for Spirit\u2019s share price, reflecting the last trading day\nprior to the announcement of the Frontier merger agreement), but the Spirit share price was adjusted for the percentage change in the US Global Jets ETF\nbetween February 4, 2022 and July 26, 2022.\nThe below tables summarize the companies, the metrics and the multiples employed in this analysis:\n2023E\nAdj. EV /\nEBITDAR\n2023E\nP / E\nAllegiant Travel Company\n4.3x\n9.1x\nFrontier Group Holdings Inc.\n3.9x\n7.9x\nJetBlue Airways Corporation\n3.3x\n7.9x\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\n4.1x\n10.8x\nSpirit\n6.0x\n16.6x\nSpirit (Unaffected)\n4.8x\n8.1x\nSpirit (JETS Adjusted)\n5.4x\n12.5x\nSun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n5.0x\n9.6x\nBased on its analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected a reference range of (i) 2023E Adj. EV / EBITDAR of 4.0x to 5.0x for Spirit\nand (ii) 2023E P / E of 8.0x to 10.0x for Spirit. Morgan Stanley applied\n58\nTable of Contents\nthe selected reference range to the corresponding financial estimates set forth in the Spirit Financial Forecasts and the Spirit Consensus Forecasted\nFinancial Information of Spirit.

EV / EBITDAR\nReference Range\nImplied Value\nPer Share Range\nSpirit Financial Forecasts\n4.0x\u20135.0x\n$\n7.00\u2013$17.50\nSpirit Consensus Forecasted Financial Information of Spirit\n4.0x\u20135.0x\n$\n4.00\u2013$13.75\n2023E P / E\nSpirit Financial Forecasts\n8.0x\u201310.0x\n$\n16.25\u2013$20.25\nSpirit Consensus Forecasted Financial Information of Spirit\n8.0x\u201310.0x\n$\n11.25\u2013$14.00\nMorgan Stanley noted that the merger consideration was $33.50 per share, based upon its assumptions made with the consent of Spirit management.\nNo company utilized in the public trading benchmark analysis is identical to Spirit or directly comparable in business mix, size or other metrics.\nAccordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing analysis necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences\nbetween Spirit and the companies being compared and other factors that would affect the value of the companies to which Spirit is being compared. In\nselecting comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with respect to size, business mix, industry performance,\ngeneral business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Spirit. These include,\namong other things, the impact of competition on Spirit\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material\nchange in the financial condition and prospects of Spirit, the industry, or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of\nSpirit or the companies to which it is being compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on Spirit, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the\npresent value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range\nof per share equity values for Spirit.\nMorgan Stanley calculated the estimated present value of the stand-alone unlevered free cash flows that Spirit was forecasted to generate for the nine\nmonths ending December 31, 2022 and calendar years 2023 through 2026 on a standalone basis. Financial data used in this analysis were based on the\nSpirit Financial Forecasts.\nMorgan Stanley performed this analysis on the estimated future cash flows contained in the Spirit Financial Forecasts as set forth in the section entitled\n\u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d For purposes of this analysis, unlevered free cash flows were calculated as Adjusted EBITDAR less\nrent expense, less unlevered cash tax expense (taking into account net operating losses and other differences between accounting tax expense and cash\ntaxes paid), less change in net working capital, less change in deferred heavy maintenance, less capital expenditures (including pre-delivery deposits for\nflight equipment, net of refunds, and proceeds from sale of property and equipment), plus certain other non-cash expenses. These estimated unlevered\nfree cash flows were reviewed and approved by Spirit management for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use.\nMorgan Stanley calculated terminal values for Spirit by applying a range of multiples of Adj. EV / EBITDAR of 5.5x to 7.0x, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nprofessional judgment, to the Adjusted EBITDAR of Spirit for the\n59\nTable of Contents\ncalendar year 2026. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the terminal value for the capitalized operating leases at December 31, 2026 (based on the Spirit\nFinancial Forecasts) and discounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to present value as of March 31, 2022 using mid-year convention\n(except for terminal value which was discounted using end-of-period methodology) and a range of discount rates from 10.6% to 12.2%, which were\nselected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment to reflect an estimate of Spirit\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (which we refer to as\n\u201cWACC\u201d). The WACC was determined utilizing the capital asset pricing model to calculate Spirit\u2019s cost of equity and estimated blended interest rate for\nSpirit\u2019s secured and unsecured debt as the basis for Spirit\u2019s cost of debt. To calculate the implied per share equity value, Morgan Stanley then divided the\nimplied equity value by the number of fully diluted shares of Spirit common stock outstanding as of July 25, 2022, as provided by Spirit management on\nJuly 25, 2022 using the treasury stock method.\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of Spirit common stock on a fully-diluted basis\n(rounded to the nearest $0.25):\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nImplied Equity\nValue\nPer Share Range\nSpirit Financial Forecasts\n$\n26.00\u2013$48.25\nMorgan Stanley noted that the merger consideration was $33.50 per share, based upon its assumptions made with the consent of Spirit management.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company\nas a function of the company\u2019s estimated future earnings. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied\npresent value for such company\u2019s potential future equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present\nequity values per share on a stand-alone basis for Spirit.\nTo calculate the discounted equity value for Spirit, Morgan Stanley utilized estimated calendar year 2025 EBITDAR and estimated calendar year 2025\nearnings per share based on the Spirit Financial Forecasts. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience after reviewing and\ncomparing certain financial estimates for Spirit, Morgan Stanley applied a range of multiples of Adj. EV / EBITDAR for the 12-month period following\nJanuary 1, 2025 of 5.0x to 6.5x, and a range of multiples of P / E for the 12-month period following January 1, 2025 of 9.0x to 11.0x, respectively, to these\nestimates, which ranges were selected based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience taking into account Spirit\u2019s historical long-\nterm trading multiples, and discounted the resulting values to March 31, 2022 at a discount rate of 12.9% based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s estimate of Spirit\u2019s\nthen-current cost of equity.\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of Spirit common"
