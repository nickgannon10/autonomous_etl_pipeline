            "Annex B\n \nJune 23, 2022\nBoard of Directors \nZendesk, Inc. \n989 Market Street \nSan Francisco, CA 94103\nMembers of the Board:\nWe understand that Zendesk, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), Zoro BidCo, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation (\u201cParent\u201d), and Zoro Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of\nParent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), plan to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) dated as of\nJune 24, 2022, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the\n\u201cMerger\u201d). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the\nMerger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, of the Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the\nMerger (such shares, collectively, \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d or \u201cShares\u201d and each, a \u201cShare\u201d), other than (i) each\nShare that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or its Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in the Merger\nAgreement), including Merger Sub, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger or held by the Company or\nits wholly owned subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (in each case, other than any such\nShares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of third parties), (ii) Dissenting Shares (as such\nterm is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (iii) Shares underlying or comprising unexercised, unvested or\nunsettled Company Equity Awards (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) shall be converted\nautomatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $77.50 in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d), subject to any required Tax (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) withholding as\nprovided in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger\nAgreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in\naccordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other\nthan Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated June 23, 2022\n(the \u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and\nother business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information\nrelating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial projections and operating\ndata of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and\nfinancial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed\nthe historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance\nof the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected\npublicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly\navailable, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information\nand considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed\nwith, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the\nCompany, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,\nthat they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of\nthe management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered\nthereby. We express no view as to the Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have\nassumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final executed Merger\nAgreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in\nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u202f\naccordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition,\nwe have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no\ndelays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or\nthe contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent\nevaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have\nwe been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent\nverification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and\nproducts of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our\nservices, a portion of which will become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger\nfee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us\nfor certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material\nrelationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which\ncompensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except that Qatalyst Partners has provided financial\nadvisory services to Permira and received a fee of $15 million in connection with such services. Qatalyst Partners\nand/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or\nParent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these\nactivities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\neffect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nThis opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion\nis for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without\nour prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the\nMerger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company Common Stock will trade\nat any time.\nOur opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion\nand the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this\nopinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or\nthe relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our\nopinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant\nto, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with\nrespect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of\nthe Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.\nBased on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be\nreceived by the Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement is fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such Holders.\nYours faithfully,\n/s/ Qatalyst Partners LP\nQatalyst Partners LP\nOne Maritime Plaza\u2002|\u200224th Floor\u2002|\u2002San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700\u2002|\u2002www.qatalyst.com\u2002|\u2002Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnex C"
