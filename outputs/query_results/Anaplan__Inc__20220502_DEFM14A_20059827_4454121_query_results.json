            "Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for\npurposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (3) may be\nsubject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Anaplan, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with\nnegotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different\nfrom those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent\nand Merger Sub by Anaplan in connection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the\nMerger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among Anaplan, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and\nmay be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party\nbeneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof\nas characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Anaplan, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.\nMoreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In\naddition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Anaplan, Parent and\nMerger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement\nor as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual\ninformation regarding Anaplan, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other\nagreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our\nfilings with the SEC regarding Anaplan and our business.",
