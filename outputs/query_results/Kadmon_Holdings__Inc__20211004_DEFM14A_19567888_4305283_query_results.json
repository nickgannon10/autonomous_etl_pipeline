With respect to the projections, we have relied on\nrepresentations that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of the senior management of Kadmon as to the expected future performance of Kadmon.

We have assumed that the executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from those reviewed\nby CF&CO.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(contingent or otherwise) of Kadmon, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. During the course of our\nengagement, we were asked by the Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest from various third parties\nregarding a transaction with Kadmon, and we have considered the results of such solicitation in rendering our\nopinion. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms\nof the Agreement without any limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory or\notherwise, that would be material in any respect to our analysis or our opinion.

CF&CO may seek to provide Kadmon and Sanofi and their respective affiliates with certain\ninvestment banking and other services unrelated to the Merger in the future.\nConsistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, CF&CO has adopted certain policies and procedures to\nestablish and maintain the independence of CF&CO\u2019s research departments and personnel. As a result, CF&CO\u2019s\nresearch analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports\nwith respect to Kadmon, Sanofi, the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from the views of\nCF&CO\u2019s investment banking personnel.\nIn the ordinary course of business, CF&CO and its affiliates may actively trade (for their own accounts and for the\naccounts of their customers) certain equity and debt securities, bank debt and/or other financial instruments issued\nby Kadmon and/or Sanofi and their respective affiliates, as well as derivatives thereof, and, accordingly, may at any\ntime hold long or short positions in such securities, bank debt, financial instruments and derivatives.\nIt is understood that this letter is intended for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of Kadmon (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger.
