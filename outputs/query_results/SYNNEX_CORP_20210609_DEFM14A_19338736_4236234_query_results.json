VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE \u00a7 25401\nBreidenbach, Laurie Simon Hodrick, Hau\nLee, Matthew Miau, Dwight Steffensen,\nAnn Vezina, Thomas Wurster, Duane\nZitzner, Andrea Zulberti, SYNNEX\nCorporation, and Tech Data Corporation,\n \n                     Defendants.\n \n  \n  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED\nPlaintiff, as and for his complaint for securities fraud under California Corporations Code \u00a725401, intentional misrepresentation and concealment, and\nnegligent misrepresentation and concealment, alleges upon personal knowledge as to himself and his own acts, and upon information and belief derived\nfrom, inter alia, documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and publicly available news sources, as to all other matters, as\nfollows:\nNATURE OF THE ACTION\n1. This lawsuit is brought pursuant to California Corporations Code \u00a725401 and the common law of California against SYNNEX Corporation (\u201cSYNNEX\u201d\nor the \u201cCompany\u201d), its board of directors (collectively the \u201cBoard\u201d or the \u201cDirector Defendants\u201d) as well as Tech Data Corporation (\u201cTech Data\u201d).\nPlaintiff, a shareholder of SYNNEX, asserts claims under California law in connection with SYNNEX\u2019s transfer of $ 1.61 billion in cash and 44 million newly\nissued shares of SYNNEX\u2019s common stock (the \u201cShare Issuance\u201d), representing 45% of SYNNEX\u2019s voting stock, to funds affiliated with private equity\nfund Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the \u201cApollo Funds\u201d) in exchange for Tech Data (the \u201cSale\u201d), a corporation wholly owned by the Apollo Funds.\nThe Sale consideration amounts to $7.2 billion, or $1.2 billion more than the $6 billion that the Apollo Funds paid to purchase Tech Data almost one\nyear ago. Even the valuation prepared by Defendants\u2019 financial advisor indicates that Defendants are overpaying for Tech Data.\n \nG-1\nCOMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATIONTable of Contents\n2. The transaction is being driven by the Defendants\u2019 personal interests in empire building. The Sale will result in the combined company becoming the\nworld\u2019s largest IT distributor, nearly $10 billion larger than its nearest competitor. Following the Sale, Dennis Polk, SYNNEX\u2019s current Chief Executive\nOfficer, will serve as Executive Chairman of the combined Company and a majority of SYNNEX\u2019s current, highly compensated directors will become\ndirectors of the significantly larger, merged company and will receive additional compensation as a result of the merger.\n3. The Sale and Share Issuance are subject to the approval of the shareholders of SYNNEX, including Plaintiff.\n4. On or about May 3, 2021, in connection with soliciting action by Plaintiff in connection with the Sale and Share Issuance, the Defendants caused a\nproxy statement (the \u201cProxy\u201d) to be distributed to Plaintiff and other SYNNEX\u2019s shareholders soliciting and urging shareholders, including Plaintiff, to\nvote in favor of the Sale and Share Issuance.\n5. The Proxy violates California Corporations Code \u00a725401 and the common law of California because it contains intentionally false and misleading\nstatements regarding, among other things, the conflicts of interest of those promoting the Sale, and the financial information upon which SYNNEX\u2019s\nfinancial advisor, Duff & Phelps, LLC (\u201cDuff & Phelps\u201d), relied in formulating its opinion that the Sale consideration is fair to SYNNEX shareholders.\n6. This action seeks, inter alia, to enjoin the Defendants from continuing to violate California Corporations Code \u00a725401 and California common law and\nto remedy the false and misleading statements in the Proxy.\n7. This complaint asserts claims under California law only and specifically excludes, does not allege and disclaims any and all claims (i) asserted\nderivatively on behalf of the corporation, (ii) for breach of fiduciary duties, (iii) arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation\nLaw (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, and/or (iv) governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nJURISDICTION\n8. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to the California Constitution, Article VI, Section 10, because this case is an\naction not given by statute to other trial courts.\n9. This Court has jurisdiction over the Defendants in this action pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 410.10 because SYNNEX is headquartered and has its\nprincipal place of business in this State, the Director Defendants are residents of this State and/or and the improper conduct alleged in this Complaint\noccurred in and/or was directed at this state.\n10. Venue lies in this Court because certain Defendants, including, upon information and belief, Dwight Steffensen, are residents of San Luis Obispo\nCounty.\nTHE PARTIES\n11. Plaintiff Joel Zalvin has owned shares of SYNNEX at all relevant times.\n12. Defendant SYNNEX is a corporation headquartered at 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont, California 94538.

He previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company from March 2008 to March I, 2018, and as Co-\nChief Executive Officer of the Company from March 2008 until December 2008. Mr. Murai\u2019s interests are not aligned with those of Plaintiff and other\nSYNNEX\u2019s shareholders with regard to the Sale. Indeed, Defendants have admitted that they have conflicts of interest with regard to the Sale. Among\nsuch conflicts are that certain of SYNNEX\u2019s directors may continue to serve as directors of the post-Sale company with concomitant lucrative\ncompensation and/or may receive payments for outstanding equity awards they hold. The Defendants have failed to disclose the extent to which\nMr. Murai will receive the above benefits.

Defendant Fred Breidenbach (\u201cMr. Breidenbach\u201d) is a longstanding SYNNEX director having served as a director of the Company since 2003.\nMr. Breidenbach\u2019s interests are not aligned with those of Plaintiff and other SYNNEX\u2019s shareholders with regard to the Sale.

The\ndecrease in the absolute dollar value of the provision for income taxes as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in taxable earnings, as\nwell as the net impact of the aforementioned items.\n2020 - 2019 Commentary\nThe increase in both the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the impact of the\nfollowing:\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we finalized our analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased our estimate of the one-time\ntransition tax by $49.2 million.\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $13.0 million in relation to a settlement agreement reached with Avnet.\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $9.6 million due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters related to TS.\n \n \n\u2022\n In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $6.0 million related to changes in deferred tax valuation allowances.\nAdditionally, the increase in the absolute dollar value of the provision for income taxes as compared to the prior year is due to an increase in taxable\nearnings. The change in the effective tax rate was also impacted by goodwill impairment expense in fiscal 2019 which was not deductible for tax purposes\nand the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (which we refer to as \u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) which significantly\nrevised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a\nmodified territorial tax system that included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The SEC provided\naccounting and reporting guidance that allowed us to report provisional amounts within a measurement period up to one year due to the complexities\ninherent in adopting the changes. Accordingly, in fiscal 2018, we recorded our provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we finalized our analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased our estimate of the one-time transition tax by\n$49.2 million, primarily due to further analysis of earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries and the utilization of foreign tax credits.\n \n141\nTable of Contents\nTax Indemnifications\nIn connection with the acquisition of TS, pursuant to the interest purchase agreement, the Company and Avnet agreed to indemnify each other in relation\nto certain tax matters. As a result, we have recorded certain indemnification assets and liabilities for expected amounts to be received from and paid to\nAvnet. During the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters and the expiration of certain\nstatutes of limitation, we recorded benefits in income tax expense of\n$0.6 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively.
