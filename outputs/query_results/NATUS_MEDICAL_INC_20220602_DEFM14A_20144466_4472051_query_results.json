Such forecasts and projections\nwere not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure. All such forecasted or projected financial information is\nbased on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors\nrelated to general economic and competitive conditions, including, without limitation, assumptions regarding the\nwidespread disruption, extraordinary uncertainty and unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such\nforecasted or projected financial information. Stifel has relied on this forecasted or projected information, including\nwithout limitation estimates of the management of the Company of the price to be received for the Specified Assets,\nwithout independent verification or analyses and does not in any respect assume any responsibility for the accuracy\nor completeness thereof. Stifel expresses no opinion as to any such forecasted or projected information or any other\nestimates or the assumptions on which they were made.\nWe also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of\noperations, business or prospects of the Company since the date of the last financial information made available to\nus. We did not make or obtain any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the Company\u2019s assets\nor liabilities, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Estimates of values of companies and\nassets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be\nsold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, Stifel assumes no responsibility for their accuracy.\nWe have assumed that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the Draft Merger Agreement.\nWe have also assumed that the Merger will be consummated substantially on the terms and conditions described in\nthe Merger Agreement without any waiver of material terms or conditions by the Company or any other party and\nwithout any anti-dilution or other adjustment to the Merger Consideration, and that obtaining any necessary\nregulatory approvals or satisfying any other conditions for consummation of the Merger will not have an adverse\neffect on the Company or the Merger. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a manner that\ncomplies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further assumed\nthat the Company has relied upon the advice of its counsel, independent accountants and other advisors (other than\nStifel) as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to the Company, the\nMerger and the Merger Agreement.\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard of Directors - Natus Medical Incorporated \nApril 17, 2022 \nPage 3\nOur Opinion is limited to whether the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded\nShares), from a financial point of view, and does not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the Merger\nincluding, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any consequences of the Merger on the Company,\nits stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects or implications of any voting, support, stockholder or\nother agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the Merger or\notherwise.

In addition, the Opinion does not compare the relative\nmerits of the Merger with any other alternative transactions or business strategies which may have been available to\nthe Company and does not address the underlying business decision of the Board or the Company to proceed with\nor effect the Merger.\nWe are not legal, tax, regulatory or bankruptcy advisors.

We have acted as financial\nadvisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of\nwhich is contingent upon the completion of the Merger (the \u201cAdvisory Fee\u201d). We have also acted as financial\nadvisor to the Board and will receive a fee upon the delivery of this Opinion that is not contingent upon\nconsummation of the Merger (the \u201cOpinion Fee\u201d), provided that such Opinion Fee is creditable against any Advisory\nFee.
