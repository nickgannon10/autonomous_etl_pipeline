Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to\nBrookfield Reinsurance and/or its affiliates and BN and its affiliates and portfolio companies, from time to\ntime for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has received, and may receive, compensation, including\nhaving acted as a book runner in connection with an equity offering for SelectQuote, Inc., a portfolio\ncompany of BN, in March 2021\u037e as a book runner in connection with a bond offering for Vistra Operations\nCompany LLC, a subsidiary of Vistra Corp., a portfolio company of BN (which we refer to as \u201cVistra\u201d), in May\n2021\u037e as a book runner with respect to a term loan facility and asset-based loan facility in connection with\nBN\u2019s acquisition of DexKo Global Inc. in October 2021\u037e as a book runner in connection with an offering of\nperpetual preferred units for Vistra, in October 2021\u037e as lead book runner in connection with an offering of\nperpetual preferred units for Vistra in December 2021\u037e as financial advisor to Brookfield Property Partners\nL.P., an affiliate of BN, in connection with the sale of Capital Automotive LLC, a portfolio company of BN, in\nFebruary 2022\u037e and as a book runner in connection with a bond offering for Sabine Pass Liquefaction, LLC, a\nportfolio company of BN, in November 2022. During the two-year period ended February 8, 2023, Goldman\nSachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by\nGoldman Sachs Investment Banking to Brookfield Reinsurance and/or its affiliates and BN and/or its\nsubsidiaries, of approximately $71 million. During the two-year period ended February 8, 2023, Goldman\nSachs Investment Banking has not been engaged by Voce or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or\nunderwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs may also in\nthe future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance,\nVoce and their respective affiliates and BN and its affiliates and portfolio companies, for which Goldman\nSachs Investment Banking may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-\ninvested with BN, Voce and their respective affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited\npartnership units or other securities, as applicable, of BN, Voce and/or their respective affiliates from time to\ntime and may do so in the future.\nThe board of directors of Argo Group selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an\ninternationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to\nthe merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 26, 2022, Argo Group engaged Goldman Sachs to act as\nits financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction. The engagement letter between Argo\nGroup and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available\nas of the date of announcement, at approximately $10.5 million, all of which is contingent upon\nconsummation of the merger. In addition, Argo Group has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of\nits expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related\npersons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nCertain Argo Group Prospective Financial Information\nArgo Group management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future\nperformance or earnings and is especially cautious of making projections due to the significant\nunpredictability inherent in its businesses. However, certain financial projections were prepared by Argo\nGroup\u2019s management and provided to and approved for use by, Goldman Sachs, a financial advisor to the\nArgo Group board of directors, in connection with its evaluation of the merger (which we refer to as the\n\u201cfinancial projections\u201d). The financial projections were not developed for the purposes of providing earnings\nguidance. In addition, Argo Group provided the financial projections to certain interested parties in\nconnection with their evaluation of a potential transaction with Argo Group, including Brookfield\nReinsurance.\nThe financial projections each represent only one scenario in a wide range of potential outcomes. While\npresented with numeric specificity, the financial projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions\nwith respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial\nconditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Argo Group\u2019s business, all of which are\ninherently uncertain and difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Argo Group\u2019s control. The\nfinancial projections are subjective in many respects and thus are susceptible to multiple interpretations and\nperiodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections may\nalso be affected by Argo Group\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the\napplicable periods. As such, the financial projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject\nto risks and uncertainties,\n42 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nincluding the various risks set forth in the sections of this proxy statement titled \u201cCautionary Statements\nConcerning Forward-Looking Information\u201d and in Argo Group\u2019s most recent reports on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and\nother documents of Argo Group on file with or furnished to the SEC. Argo Group shareholders should read\nsuch sections of this proxy statement and such reports filed with the SEC for additional information\nregarding the risks inherent in forward-looking information such as the financial projections. The financial\nprojections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each\nsuccessive year.\nThe financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of\nCertified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information, but, in\nview of Argo Group\u2019s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis. However, this information is not\nfact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy\nstatement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial projections. Argo Group\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, KPMG LLP, has\nnot audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the financial\nprojections included below and, accordingly, KPMG LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of\nassurance with respect thereto. The KPMG LLP report, incorporated by reference in Item 15 of Argo Group\u2019s\nmost recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, relates to Argo\nGroup\u2019s previously issued financial statements and does not extend to the prospective financial information\nand should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the financial projections do not take into account any\ncircumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.\nCertain of the financial projections set forth herein were not prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cnon-GAAP\u201d) financial measures. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in\ncompliance with generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d), and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures as used in the financial projections may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts\nused by other companies or persons. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from\nthe definition of non-GAAP financial measures and therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding\ndisclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Accordingly, Argo Group has not provided a reconciliation\nof the financial measures included in the financial projections which have been provided to Goldman Sachs\nfor purposes of preparing its financial analyses and opinions.\nThe information about the financial projections set forth below do not give effect to the merger and\nnone of the financial projections take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated.\nYou are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on the financial projections set forth below. The\ninclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that\nany of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or their affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or\nconsider the financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the financial projections\nshould not be relied upon as such. None of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or their respective affiliates,\nadvisors or representatives can give any assurance that actual results will not materially differ from the\nfinancial projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile\nthe financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such financial projections were\ngenerated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions\nunderlying the financial projections are shown to be in error. None of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or\ntheir respective affiliates, advisors or representatives makes any representation to any other person\nregarding the financial projections. The financial projections are not being included in this proxy statement\nto influence a shareholder\u2019s decision regarding how to vote on any given proposal, but because the financial\nprojections were provided to Goldman Sachs, and, at the direction of Argo Group, used by Goldman Sachs in\nits financial analysis, they are accordingly disclosed in this proxy statement. The financial projections are for\nillustrative purposes and should not be considered an indication of what Argo Group may do in the future.\n43 \n",

However, Argo Group will continue to make securities filings with\nrespect to its publicly-held preferred shares to the extent such filings are required under SEC regulations\nfollowing the completion of the merger. Argo Group may decide, following the merger, to delist the\ndepositary shares from the NYSE, to deregister such depositary shares under the Exchange Act or to take\nother action with respect to the depositary shares and preferred shares.\nThe directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be the initial directors of Argo\nGroup as the surviving company until their earlier death, resignation or removal or until their respective\nsuccessors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

            "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is included\nas Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the material\nprovisions of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain\nall of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. Argo Group encourages you to\nread carefully the merger agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger as it\nis the legal document governing the merger.\nThe merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with\ninformation regarding the terms of the merger agreement and is not intended to provide any factual\ninformation about Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance. Factual disclosures about Argo Group or\nBrookfield Reinsurance contained in this proxy statement or Argo Group\u2019s public reports filed with the\nSEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Argo Group or Brookfield\nReinsurance contained in the merger agreement and described in the summary. The representations,\nwarranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance and\nMerger Sub are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Argo Group, Brookfield\nReinsurance and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In\nparticular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and\ndescribed in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were\nnegotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement,\nrather than establishing matters as facts, and may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. The\nrepresentations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be\ndifferent from that generally relevant to shareholders or applicable to reports and documents filed with the\nSEC, and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other,\nwhich disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed. The\nrepresentations and warranties in the merger agreement will not survive the completion of the merger.\nMoreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have\nchanged since the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information\nqualifying a representation or warranty may have been included or incorporated by reference into this\nproxy statement. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any\ndescriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the\ninformation provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents incorporated by reference\ninto this proxy statement. See the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d\nThe Merger\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement, and\npursuant to the applicable provisions of the Companies Act, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with\nand into Argo Group, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Argo Group will survive\nthe merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance.\nEffects of the Merger\nThe merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, each common share issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time (other than any common share that is owned by Argo Group as\ntreasury shares, by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or by Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance,\nMerger Sub or wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or any common share\nthat is subject to an Argo Group equity award) will be converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash,\nwithout interest and less any required withholding tax. All such common shares will no longer be issued and\noutstanding and will be canceled and cease to exist and each holder of a certificate previously evidencing\nany common shares or uncertificated common shares represented by book-entry will cease to have any\nrights with respect to those shares, except the right to receive the merger consideration.\nAt the effective time, Brookfield Reinsurance will become the sole owner of Argo Group\u2019s common\nshares. Therefore, current Argo Group common shareholders will cease to have direct or indirect ownership\ninterests in Argo Group or rights as Argo Group common shareholders, will not participate in any future\nearnings or growth of Argo Group, will not benefit from any appreciation in value of Argo Group and will not\nbear the future risks of Argo Group\u2019s operations.\n57 ",
