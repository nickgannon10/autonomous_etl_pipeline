We have not been requested\nto opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the Company\u2019s underlying business\ndecision to proceed with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the\nProposed Transaction. In addition, we express no opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner\naddress, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or\nemployees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger\nConsideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company in the Proposed Transaction.

In\naddition, we have had discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business,\noperations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects and have undertaken such other studies,\nanalyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial\nand other information used by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not\nassumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information) and have further\nrelied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or\ncircumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading.
