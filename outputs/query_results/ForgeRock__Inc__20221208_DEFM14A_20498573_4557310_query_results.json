We\nhave not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our\nengagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\nhave we evaluated the solvency of the Company, the Acquiror or Merger Sub under any state or federal laws relating\nto bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived\ntherefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and\nfinancial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that\nthe definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us.

In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a\nlender under outstanding credit facilities of portfolio companies of TB, for which it receives customary compensation\nor other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the\noutstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we\nand our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,\nbank loans or other obligations) of the Company, the Acquiror or TB and its portfolio companies for our own account\nor for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities\nor other financial instruments.\nOn the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid\nto the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders.\nThe issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P.

            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger\nagreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger\nagreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not\ncontain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the\nparties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other\ninformation contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from\nthose generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by\nconfidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by ForgeRock in connection with the merger agreement.\nIn addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of\nallocating contractual risk between ForgeRock and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as\nfacts. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.\nOur stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of ForgeRock, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the\nmerger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the\nmerger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the\nrespective businesses of ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are\neither expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to\nby the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding ForgeRock, Parent, Merger Sub or\ntheir respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the\nmerger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this\ndocument and in our filings with the SEC regarding ForgeRock and our business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub and ForgeRock that is no\nlater than (a) if the last condition to the closing of the merger to be satisfied or waived is related to (i) waiting periods\nor required consents under the HSR Act, (ii) the absence of any order issued by any governmental authority of\ncompetent jurisdiction or any law that, in each case, prevents, materially restrains or materially impairs the\nconsummation of the merger or (iii) requisite consents, approvals and filings under certain specified FDI laws, the\nfifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions\u037e (b) if the last condition to the closing of the\nmerger to be satisfied or waived is any condition except for the ones mentioned in clause (a) above, the third\nbusiness day after the satisfaction or waiver of such condition (in each case, other than those conditions that by\ntheir terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such\nconditions)\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the\nmerger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided\nunder the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a\nlater time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.",
