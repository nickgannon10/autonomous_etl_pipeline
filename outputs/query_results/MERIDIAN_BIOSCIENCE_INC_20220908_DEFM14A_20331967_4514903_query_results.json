We refer to the Preliminary Meridian projections provided\non March 5, 2022 and the Updated Meridian projections provided on April 5, 2022 collectively as \u201cthe Meridian projections.\u201d\nThe Updated Meridian projections were made available to potential counterparties who executed a confidentiality agreement with Meridian in connection\nwith the market check performed by Meridian in June 2022 (see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d for details\nregarding the market check). The Updated Meridian projections were also made available to Rothschild & Co in connection with its review and advice to\nthe Meridian Board and special committee regarding the financial terms of the merger and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. At the\ninstruction of Meridian\u2019s management, Rothschild & Co also used the Updated Meridian projections, as further updated for Meridian\u2019s actual\nperformance between April 5, 2022 and June 30, 2022 as further described in the tables below, in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the\nMeridian Board (see the section entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of Meridian\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d for details regarding Rothschild & Co\u2019s opinion).\nThe Meridian projections shall be deemed to include for purposes of the disclaimers contained in this section, unless the context requires otherwise,\nother prospective financial information included below. Meridian advised the recipients of the Meridian projections that its internal financial forecasts are\nsubjective in many respects. The inclusion of the Meridian projections should not be regarded as an indication that the Meridian Board, Rothschild &\nCo, Meridian or its management or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future\nresults or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.\nThe Meridian projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Meridian projections were based are subjective in many respects and are\nsubject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of Meridian\u2019s industry and based on actual experience and\nbusiness developments. The Meridian\n59Table of Contents\nprojections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Meridian\u2019s revenue, margin and expense, and other\nperformance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are difficult\nto predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond Meridian\u2019s control. Multiple factors, including those described in\nthe section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d could cause the Meridian projections or the\nunderlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Meridian projections will be realized or that actual results will\nnot be significantly higher or lower than projected. Because the Meridian projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less\nreliable with each successive year. The Meridian projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they\nwere prepared, including the merger. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of\nuncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Meridian projections will be achieved. As a result, the inclusion of the Meridian projections in this\nproxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Meridian or any other person that the information is material. The summary of the\nMeridian projections is not provided to influence Meridian shareholders\u2019 decisions regarding whether to vote for the merger proposal or any other\nproposal. The Meridian projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained\nin Meridian\u2019s public filings with the SEC.\nThe prospective financial information, including the Meridian projections, were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance\nwith United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The prospective financial information,\nincluding the Meridian projections, included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Meridian\u2019s management. Ernst\n& Young LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial\ninformation, including the Meridian projections, and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto. Any Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Meridian\u2019s previously issued financial\nstatements.

These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAccordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply\nto non-GAAP financial measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the Meridian projections) in connection with a proposed transaction like\nthe merger when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP\nfinancial measures were not relied upon by\n1\nFor purposes of Rothschild & Co preparing its opinion dated July 6, 2022, Meridian\u2019s management instructed Rothschild & Co to use the Updated\nMeridian projections reflecting Meridian\u2019s actual performance through May 31, 2022. Actual performance through May 31, 2022 was lower than the\nforecast for such time period included in the Updated Meridian projections. Meridian management did not adjust the Updated Meridian projections for\nthe month of June 2022, but because the Updated Meridian projections were prepared on quarterly basis, used one-third of the projected amounts for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2022 for the month of June 2022. Using actual and estimated performance through June 30, 2022 resulted in (i) 2022E total\nrevenue of $346 million (compared to $351 million in the Updated Meridian projections), (ii) gross profit of $202 million (compared to $209 million in the\nUpdated Meridian projections) and (iii) adj. EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $102 million (compared to $108 million in the Updated Meridian projections).\nThese actual and estimated financial performance numbers had no effect on the Updated Meridian projections for 2023E, 2024E, 2025E, 2026E, or\n2027E.\n61\nTable of Contents\nRothschild & Co for purposes of its opinion or by the Meridian Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. Accordingly, Meridian has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Meridian projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nThe Meridian projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Meridian of the merger and do not attempt to predict or\nsuggest future results following the merger. The Meridian projections do not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating, executing,\ndelivering or consummating the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the merger, the effect on Meridian of\nany business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed or the effect of any\nbusiness or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered,\naccelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Meridian projections do not take into account the effect on Meridian of any\npossible failure of the merger to occur.\nFor the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after any portion of the Meridian projections was\nprepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted\nreliance on the Meridian projections set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any investor or shareholder regarding the\ninformation included in the Meridian projections. Neither Meridian nor any of its affiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness,\naccuracy or completeness of the Meridian projections. Meridian urges all Meridian shareholders to review Meridian\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a\ndescription of its reported financial results. In addition, the Meridian projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after\nthe date the Meridian projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Meridian\ndoes not intend to update or otherwise revise the Meridian projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date\nwhen made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error."
