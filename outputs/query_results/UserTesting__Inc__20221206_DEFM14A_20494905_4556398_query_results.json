our\nstockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives\nreasonably available to us, based upon the directors\u2019 extensive knowledge of our business, assets,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, the execution challenges that we potentially face, our\nhistorical and projected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger\nrepresented an attractive and comparatively certain value for our stockholders relative to the risk-\nadjusted prospects for us on a standalone basis\u037e\nthe fact that the consideration to be paid in the Merger is payable solely in cash, which allows our\nstockholders to realize immediate liquidity and certainty of value in respect of their shares of common\nstock,

belief that, after multiple rounds of negotiations with Thoma Bravo and its representatives (as\ndescribed in more detail under the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c- Background of
