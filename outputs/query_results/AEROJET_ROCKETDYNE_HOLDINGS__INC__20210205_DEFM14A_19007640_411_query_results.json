(\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As more fully described in the\nMerger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into AR Holdings (the \u201cMerger\u201d) and (ii) each\noutstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of AR Holdings (\u201cAR Holdings Common Stock\u201d)\nother than shares of AR Holdings Common stock (x) held by AR Holdings or any wholly owned subsidiary of AR\nHoldings, (y) held in AR Holdings\u2019 treasury or (z) held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary\nof Parent, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $56.00 minus, to the extent paid, the\namount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d).\nIn arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated December 17, 2020 of the Merger Agreement and held\ndiscussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of AR Holdings concerning\nthe business, operations and prospects of AR Holdings. We examined certain publicly available business and\nfinancial information relating to AR Holdings as well as certain financial forecasts reflecting a base case and an\nadjusted base case (the \u201cForecasts\u201d), and other information and data relating to AR Holdings which were provided to\nor discussed with us by the management of AR Holdings. We reviewed the financial terms of the Merger as set forth\nin the Merger Agreement in relation to, among other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes\nof AR Holdings Common Stock\u037e the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of AR Holdings\u037e and\nthe capitalization and financial condition of AR Holdings. We considered, to the extent publicly available, the\nfinancial terms of certain other transactions which we considered relevant in evaluating the Merger and analyzed\ncertain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of other companies\nwhose operations we considered relevant in evaluating those of AR Holdings. In addition to the foregoing, we\nconducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and\nmarket criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized\nby our fairness opinion committee.\nIn rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed\nby or discussed with us and upon the assurances of the management of AR Holdings that they are not aware of any\nrelevant information that has been omitted or that remains undisclosed to us.

Representatives of AR Holdings have advised\nus, and we further have assumed, with your consent, that the final terms of the Merger Agreement will not vary\nmaterially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by us. We have not made or been provided with an independent\nevaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of AR Holdings nor have we made any\nphysical inspection of the properties or assets of AR Holdings. We were not requested to, and we did not, solicit\nthird party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of AR Holdings, nor were we requested to\nconsider, and our opinion does not address, the underlying business decision of AR Holdings to effect the Merger,\nthe relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for AR Holdings\nor the effect of any other transaction in which AR Holdings might engage. We also express no view as to, and our\nopinion does not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any\ncompensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons,\nrelative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise.

In the\nordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of AR Holdings and\nParent for our own account or for the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short\nposition in such securities. In addition, we and our affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain\nrelationships with AR Holdings, Parent and their respective affiliates.\nOur advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information of the Board of Directors of\nAR Holdings in its evaluation of the proposed Merger, and our opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute\na recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the\nproposed Merger.\nBased upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work as described above and\nother factors we deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to the holders of AR Holdings Common Stock.\nVery truly yours,\n\u202f\nCITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC.\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nANNEX C"

Questions may be submitted during the special meeting through\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM. Questions and answers will be grouped by topic and\nsubstantially similar questions will be grouped and answered once.\u201d\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD AND AS A\nBENEFICIAL OWNER?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s transfer agent, Computershare, Inc.,\nyou are considered a \u201cstockholder of record\u201d or a \u201cregistered stockholder\u201d of those shares. In this case, your proxy\nmaterials have been sent to you directly by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. If your shares are held in a stock\nbrokerage account or by a bank, trust or other nominee or custodian, including shares you may own as a participant\nin the Aerojet Rocketdyne Retirement Savings Plan, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of those shares,\nwhich are held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d The proxy materials have been forwarded to you by or on behalf of your broker,\nbank, trustee or other holder who is considered the stockholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner,\nyou have the right to direct your broker, bank, trustee or other holder of record as to how to vote your shares by\nfollowing their instructions for voting.\nWHAT ARE BROKER NON-VOTES AND HOW ARE THEY COUNTED?\nBroker non-votes occur when nominees, such as brokers and banks holding shares on behalf of the beneficial\nowners, are prohibited from exercising discretionary voting authority for beneficial owners who have not provided\nvoting instructions at least ten days before the Special Meeting. If no instructions are given within that time frame,\nthe nominees may not vote those shares on matters deemed \u201cnon-routine\u201d by the NYSE. The proposals for\nstockholder consideration herein are non-routine matters and nominees cannot vote without instructions from the\nbeneficial owner. These so-called \u201cbroker non-votes,\u201d if any, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal 1\nand no effect on the outcome of Proposal 2 and Proposal 3. Broker non-votes are not counted for the purposes of\ndetermining the number of shares present in person or represented by proxy on a voting matter. For these reasons,\nplease promptly vote by telephone, or Internet, or mail.\nMAY I CHANGE MY VOTE?\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting\nby:\n\u2022\nReturning a signed proxy card bearing a later date\u037e\n\u2022\nSending written notice of revocation to the Company, c/o the Secretary\u037e\n\u2022\nSubmitting a new, proper proxy by telephone, Internet or paper ballot, after the date of the earlier voted\nproxy\u037e or\n\u2022\nAttending the Special Meeting via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM and\nvoting using the control number we have provided to you.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or\nother nominee. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the Internet at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AJRD2021SM if you obtain a legal proxy as described above.\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 1)?\nUnder applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding\nshares of Aerojet Rocketdyne common stock voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby.
