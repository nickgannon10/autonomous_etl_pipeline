If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Raven common stock would return to the\nprice at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of\nRaven common stock.

The Board also resolved that the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the shareholders of Raven at\na special meeting of shareholders and to recommend that the shareholders of Raven vote to approve the Merger Agreement. The Raven Board consulted withRaven\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors and senior management at various times and considered a number of factors, including the following principal\nfactors (not in any relative order of importance) that the Board believed to support its decision:\n\u00b7\nRaven\u2019s business, current and projected financial performance and condition and future prospects in relation to the Merger Consideration of $58.00\nper share,\n\u00b7\nthe current and historical market prices of Raven common stock, including the market performance of Raven common stock relative to other\nparticipants in Raven\u2019s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration represented an attractive premium of\napproximately 33.6% to Raven\u2019s four-week volume-weighted average stock price,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that J.P. Morgan, at the Board\u2019s instruction, contacted six prospective buyers, that of these prospective buyers, four entered into\nconfidentiality agreements with respect to a potential transaction with the Company, two of which (including CNH Industrial) continued pursuing an\nacquisition of the Company after conducting due diligence, and that the Company did not receive a more attractive alternative bid during the sale\nprocess and prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement than the one submitted by CNH Industrial,\n\u00b7\nthe fact that Raven did not enter into any exclusivity arrangements with CNH Industrial and did not negotiate with CNH Industrial on a contractually\nexclusive basis,\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that its negotiations had resulted in the highest price per share for the common stock of the Company that CNH Industrial was\nwilling to pay,\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the process conducted by the Company had resulted in the highest price reasonably available to the shareholders of the\nCompany,\n32\nTable of Contents\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the Merger was more favorable to Raven\u2019s shareholders than the alternative of remaining a standalone independent company,\nwhich belief was based on and informed by consideration of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including:\no\ngeneral industry, economic and market conditions, both on a historical and on a prospective basis,\no\nthe risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining Raven\u2019s performance as a standalone company, including the risks and uncertainties\ndescribed in Raven\u2019s SEC filings, and\no\nthe uncertain returns to Raven\u2019s shareholders if Raven were to remain independent, taking into account, in particular, management\u2019s\nfinancial projections of the future financial performance and earnings of Raven, including those set forth below under \u201cThe Merger\n(Proposal 1)\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d and the risks involved in achieving those returns.\n\u00b7\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the risks and challenges to Raven\u2019s business described above, and in Raven\u2019s SEC filings, create substantial execution risks\nrelative to the $58.00 per share price in the Merger,\n\u00b7\nthe oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Board on June 20, 2021, which was subsequently confirmed by a written opinion, dated as of the\nsame date, addressed to the Board that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations,\nqualifications and conditions set forth in J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Raven common\nstock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders, as described further under \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014"
