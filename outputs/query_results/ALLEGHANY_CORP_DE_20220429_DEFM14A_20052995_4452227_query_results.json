            "Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe following summary of the merger agreement, and the copy of the merger agreement attached hereto as Annex A\nto this proxy statement, are intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and are not\nintended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about the Company in its periodic and current reports filed\nwith the SEC. In particular, the merger agreement and the related summary are not intended to be, and should not be\nrelied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to the Company or its subsidiaries or\naffiliates. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by the Company, Berkshire and Merger Sub\nthat were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and\ncovenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, may be\nsubject to qualifications and limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by\nconfidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger\nagreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may apply contractual standards of materiality or\nmaterial adverse effect that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the\nsubject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement,\nwhich subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company\u2019s public disclosures. Moreover, the\ndescription of the merger agreement below does not purport to describe all of the terms of such agreement and is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A\nto this proxy statement and which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAdditional information about the Company may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and the Company\u2019s other\npublic filings.
