For purposes of\nthis Agreement, \u201cwillful and material breach\u201d means an intentional breach by a Party of this Agreement that is a\nconsequence of an act or an omission undertaken or omitted by the breaching Party with the actual knowledge\nthat the taking of such act or omission would result in such breach\u037e it being acknowledged and agreed, without\nlimitation, that any failure by any Party to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions after the\napplicable conditions thereto have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are\nto be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at such time) will constitute\na willful and material breach of this Agreement.\n(b) The Company will pay to Parent a fee of $55,250,000 (the \u201cTermination Fee\u201d) if:\n(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or Parent terminates this\nAgreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)\u037e or\n(ii) (A) after the Agreement Date but prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section\n8.01, an Alternative Proposal is made by a third party to the Company or the Special Committee and not\nwithdrawn (publicly if such Alternative Proposal has been made known publicly) prior to the Company\nShareholders Meeting or is made directly to the Company\u2019s shareholders by a third party and not publicly\nwithdrawn prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting\u037e (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by\nParent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (but in the case of a termination by the Company,\nonly if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the\nsecond proviso to Section 8.01(b)(i)), by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or by Parent or the Company\npursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii)\u037e and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination, (x) the Company\nenters into a definitive Contract for an Alternative Proposal and such Alternative Proposal is consummated\n(whether during or after such twelve (12)-month period) or (y) an Alternative Proposal is consummated (in\nthe case of (x) or (y), with the approval of a majority of the independent directors on the Company Board)\u037e\nprovided, however, that for purposes of this Section 8.02(b)(ii), the references to 15% in the definition of\n\u201cAlternative Proposal\u201d will be deemed to be references to 50%.\nA-51TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAny Termination Fee due under this Section 8.02(b)(ii) will be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the\ncase of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d), substantially concurrently with and not later than\nthe next Business Day following such termination\u037e (y) in the case of termination of this Agreement pursuant to\nSection 8.01(f), on the Business Day immediately following the date of such termination\u037e and (z) in the case of clause\n(ii) above, on the date of consummation as referred to in clause (ii)(C) above.\n(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.02 are an integral part of\nthe Transactions and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this\nAgreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee as and when due to Parent pursuant to\nthis Section 8.02, it will also be obligated to pay any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent and its\nAffiliates in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the\nCompany for the Termination Fee (the \u201cCosts and Expenses\u201d), together with interest on the amount of any\nunpaid Termination Fee and Costs and Expenses from the date such Termination Fee and/or Costs and Expense\nwas required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal\non the date that such Termination Fee was required to be paid (the \u201cInterest\u201d).
