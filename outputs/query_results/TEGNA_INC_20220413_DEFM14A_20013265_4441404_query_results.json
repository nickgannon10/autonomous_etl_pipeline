In the two years preceding the\ndate of this opinion we have been engaged by certain affiliates of Apollo and Ares Management Corporation\n(\u201cAres\u201d) to provide financial advisory services\u037e however, no transactions have ensued and we have not received any\ncompensation for our engagements from either Apollo or Ares or their affiliates.\nIt is understood that this letter is solely for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity\nas such) (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and is rendered to the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and may not\nbe used for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person without our prior written consent.

            "Other Information\nPresent Value of Future Share Price. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\ncalculated a range of the present values of future share prices using the multiple reference range of 7.0x to 8.0x based\non the ratio of enterprise value to average 2022-23E Weighted Sensitivity Case EBITDA and a 12.3% cost of equity.\nBased on the foregoing, Greenhill noted that the range of such present values of future shares price was $22.09 to\n$26.54 per share of TEGNA common stock.\nPrecedent Premiums Paid. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill calculated a\nrange of implied share prices by applying a range of precedent premiums paid from 25% to 35% to the unaffected\nclosing price of TEGNA common stock of $17.26 as of September 14, 2021. Based on the foregoing, Greenhill noted\nthat the range of implied prices per share was $21.58 to $23.30 per share of TEGNA common stock.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\nreviewed certain equity research analyst price targets for TEGNA common stock between TEGNA\u2019s Q2\u201921 earnings\nrelease on August 9, 2021 and September 14, 2021. Greenhill noted that the range of such price targets was $20.00 to\n$24.00 per share of TEGNA common stock.\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\nreviewed the trading range for TEGNA common stock for the trailing 52-week period as of September 14, 2021.\nGreenhill noted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $11.26 and $21.52 per share of\nTEGNA common stock, respectively.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by Greenhill. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process\nand is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Greenhill believes\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the\nforegoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete\nview of the processes underlying the analyses and its fairness opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting\nfrom any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of Greenhill with respect to the actual value of TEGNA.\nThe order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nGreenhill. In arriving at its opinion, Greenhill did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors\nconsidered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),\nconsidered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, Greenhill considered the totality of the\nfactors and analyses performed in determining its opinion. Accordingly, Greenhill believes that the summary set forth\nabove and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions thereof, without considering all of\nits analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by\nGreenhill are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, Greenhill\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the summary of the peer trading multiples analysis or the precedent transaction\nmultiples analysis is identical to TEGNA, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger.\nHowever, the companies for the peer trading multiples analysis were selected because they are publicly traded\ncompanies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to\nthose of TEGNA. The transactions selected for the precedent transaction multiples analysis were similarly chosen\nbecause their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to\nthe Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in\nfinancial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies\ncompared to TEGNA and the transactions compared to the Merger.\nGreenhill is an internationally recognized investment banking firm regularly engaged in providing financial advisory\nservices in connection with mergers and acquisitions. TEGNA selected Greenhill as its financial advisor in connection\nwith the Merger on the basis of Greenhill\u2019s experience in similar transactions, its reputation in the investment banking\ncommunity and its familiarity with the media sector.\nFor services rendered in connection with the Merger and the delivery of the opinion, TEGNA has agreed to pay\nGreenhill a fee of $12,000,000, of which $2,000,000 became payable upon delivery of Greenhill\u2019s fairness opinion and\nthe remainder of which is contingent and payable only upon the completion of the Merger. In addition, TEGNA has\nagreed to reimburse Greenhill for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and\ndisbursements of counsel, and will indemnify Greenhill against certain liabilities arising out of Greenhill\u2019s\nengagement. During the two years preceding the date of Greenhill\u2019s opinion, Greenhill has not been engaged by,\nperformed any services for or received any compensation from TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub, Standard General,\nApollo, the other Parent Restructuring Entities or their respective affiliates, other than the compensation that was\npaid to Greenhill under the letter agreements pursuant to which Greenhill was retained as a financial advisor to\nTEGNA in connection with the Merger. In the two years preceding the date of Greenhill\u2019s opinion, Greenhill has been\nengaged by certain affiliates of Apollo and Ares Management to provide financial advisory services\u037e however, no\ntransactions have ensued, and Greenhill has not received any compensation for its engagements from either Apollo\nor Ares Management or their affiliates."

The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this\nsummary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to\nthe Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this\nproxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger Agreement, which is the\nlegal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the\nMerger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express\nterms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy\nstatement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(i) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (ii) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (iii) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub and the other Parent Restructuring Entities in\nconnection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement.
