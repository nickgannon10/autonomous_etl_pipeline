            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and\nelsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. KnowBe4 encourages you to carefully read and consider\nthe Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the\nMerger Agreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. \nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of\nthe Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to\nimportant qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports\nand documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by KnowBe4 in\nconnection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the\npurpose of allocating contractual risk between KnowBe4, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, rather than to establish\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger\nAgreement may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a\nchange in circumstance or otherwise. KnowBe4\u2019s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not\nrely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or\ncondition of KnowBe4, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of\nthe representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the\nclosing of the Merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the Merger Agreement after the effective time of the Merger. In addition, you\nshould not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of KnowBe4, Parent and Merger Sub\nbecause the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as\notherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger agreement is described\nbelow, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other\nfactual information regarding KnowBe4, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants\nand other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document\nand in KnowBe4\u2019s filings with the SEC regarding KnowBe4 and its business.",
