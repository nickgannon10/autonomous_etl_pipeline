            "Litigation Related to the Mergers (page 62)\nFollowing the filing of the preliminary proxy statement, plaintiffs filed three separate lawsuits related to the proxy statement. One suit, styled Cody\nCharfauros v. American Campus Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04075, which we refer to as the \u201cCharfauros Lawsuit\u201d was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York. A second suit, styled as Shiva Stein v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., No.\n1:22-cv-03829-JGK, which we refer to as the \u201cStein Lawsuit,\u201d was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nA third suit, styled as Samuel Acuna v. American Campus Communities, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-03254, which we refer to as the \u201cAcuna Lawsuit,\u201d was\nfiled in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\nThe Charfauros Lawsuit names as defendants the Company, the Company\u2019s directors and a former director of the Company who ceased to serve as\nsuch in 2015 upon his death. The Charfauros Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including the\nrights, authorities and powers of the special committee, the confidentiality agreements with Blackstone and other counterparties, potential conflicts\nof interest involving certain directors and officers of the Company, the value of Company options, restricted stock units, and other equity awards\nthat the Company\u2019s directors and officers will receive in the proposed mergers, details regarding any discussions about the future employment of\nthe Company\u2019s officers and directors, certain financial projections and metrics, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of\nnon-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, and input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis. Relying on those allegations, the\nCharfauros Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff, a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and\na \u201ccontrol person\u201d claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violations against the members of our board of\ndirectors. The Charfauros Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers, rescission of the mergers if the mergers\nare consummated, the dissemination of a revised preliminary proxy statement, an award of damages if the mergers are consummated and an award of\nplaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe Stein Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors. Like the Charfauros Lawsuit, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a\nclaim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of\nour board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial\nprojections, financial metrics, input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to\nGAAP metrics. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers unless and until defendants disclose the\nmaterial information alleged to have been omitted from the proxy statement, rescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are\nconsummated, an award of damages and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe Acuna Lawsuit, like the Charfauros Lawsuit and the Stein Lawsuit, names as defendants the Company and the Company\u2019s directors and asserts\na claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of\nour board of directors. The Acuna Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial\nprojections (including line items underlying the projections, net income projections and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP\nmetrics), input data and assumptions used in BofA Securities\u2019 analysis, potential conflicts of interest involving KeyBank Capital Markets Inc. and\npotential conflicts of interest\n13Table of Contents\ninvolving certain directors and officers of the Company. The Acuna Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed mergers,\nrescission of the mergers or rescissory damages if the mergers are consummated, a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of\nthe Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and an award of plaintiff\u2019s costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the mergers from becoming effective in a timely manner.\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and\nintends to defend against these actions vigorously."
