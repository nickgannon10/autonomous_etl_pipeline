            "ANNEX B \n \nMarch 13, 2023\nBoard of Directors \nMomentive Global Inc. \nOne Curiosity Way\nSan Mateo, CA 94403\nMembers of the Board:\nWe understand that Momentive Global Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), Mercury Bidco LLC, a\nDelaware limited liability company (\u201cParent\u201d), and Mercury Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), plan to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger\nAgreement\u201d) dated as of March 13, 2023, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and\ninto the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the\neffective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of\ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior\nto the effective time of the Merger (such shares, collectively, \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d or \u201cShares\u201d and each, a\n\u201cShare\u201d), other than (i) each Share to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii) of the Merger\nAgreement and (ii) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), shall be\nconverted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $9.46 in cash, without interest (the\n\u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), subject to any required Tax (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) withholding\nas provided in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger\nAgreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in\naccordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other\nthan Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated March\n13, 2023 (the \u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial\nstatements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-\nlooking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial\nprojections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past\nand current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the\nCompany. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock\nwith that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the\nfinancial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other\nanalyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.\nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u202f \nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed\nwith, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the\nCompany, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,\nthat they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of\nthe management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered\nthereby. We express no view as to the Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have\nassumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final executed Merger\nAgreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the\nreceipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be\nimposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in\nthe proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or\nappraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of\nthe Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with\nsuch technology and products.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our\nservices, a portion of which will become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger\nfee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us\nfor certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material\nrelationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Parent, Symphony\nTechnology Group or the other equity co-investors of Parent, or their respective affiliates, pursuant to which\ncompensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except that Qatalyst Partners acted as a financial\nadvisor to the Company in connection with certain shareholder activism and governance matters. Qatalyst Partners\nand/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or\nParent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,\ndomestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these\nactivities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\neffect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u202f\nThis opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice.

            "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the\nmerger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified\nin their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement\nas Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read\nand consider the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety\nbecause this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to\nyou. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements described below and included in the merger\nagreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were\nmade solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important\nqualifications, limitations, and supplemental information agreed to by Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub in\nconnection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a\ncontractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed\nwith the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub\nby Momentive in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may\nhave been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between\nMomentive and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances\nin which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or\notherwise. Momentive\u2019s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement\nand should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements or any descriptions\nthereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Momentive, Parent, or Merger Sub or\nany of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. Except where expressly\nprovided in the merger agreement, none of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the\nmerger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of\nthe merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations\non the respective businesses of Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain\nactions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as\notherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the\npublic. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with\ninformation regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information\nregarding Momentive, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,\nwarranties, covenants, and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you\nshould read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in Momentive\u2019s filings with the SEC\nregarding Momentive and Momentive\u2019s business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub, and Momentive\nthat is no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the\nmerger agreement) of the last condition to the closing of the merger (other than those conditions that by\ntheir term are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the\nextent permitted under the merger agreement) of such conditions)\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by\nMomentive, Parent, and Merger Sub in writing. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will cause the\nmerger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of\nthat certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at a later time agreed to in\nwriting by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL."
