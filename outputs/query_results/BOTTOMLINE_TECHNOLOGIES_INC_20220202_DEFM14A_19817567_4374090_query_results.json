In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, such person will be\nentitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation in accordance\nwith the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e provided that any person to whom\nexpenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation\nor bylaws to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification, and the Surviving\nCorporation will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.\nFor a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will either cause to be maintained in effect the current\npolicies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for Bottomline and its\nsubsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance coverage currently\nmaintained by Bottomline and its subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the\ninsured persons than the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries with respect to claims\narising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an \u201cA\u201d rating by A.M.

            "Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and\nelsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to\nthis proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and\nin its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations\nof the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy\nstatement. Capitalized terms used in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of\nthe Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (3) may be subject to\nimportant qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those\ngenerally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger\nSub by Bottomline in connection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger\nAgreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be\nsubject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries\nunder the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as\ncharacterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Bottomline, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover,\ninformation concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you\nshould not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub,\nbecause the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as\notherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described\nbelow, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual\ninformation regarding Bottomline, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other\nagreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our\nfilings with the SEC regarding Bottomline and our business."
