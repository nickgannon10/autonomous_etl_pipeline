The descriptions of the\nmerger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are\nqualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to\ncarefully read and consider the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger,\nand in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement\nthat is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger\nagreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made\nsolely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications,\nlimitations and supplemental information agreed to by Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub in connection\nwith negotiating the terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard\nof materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in\nsome cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Mandiant in\nconnection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been\nincluded in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Mandiant and\nParent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of\nmateriality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger\nif the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance\nor otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and\nshould not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof\nas characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Mandiant, Parent or Merger Sub or any of\ntheir respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the\nrepresentations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no\nlegal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not\nrely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of\nMandiant, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly\npermitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the\nappropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Mandiant, Parent, Merger\nSub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other\nagreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information\nprovided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Mandiant and our\nbusiness.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini\nGoodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, located at 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304 (or\nremotely via the electronic exchange of documents), on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than\nthe fourth business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement)\nof the last to be satisfied or waived of the closing conditions of the merger (described in the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Closing of the Merger\u201d), other than\nconditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction\nor waiver of each of such conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time, location and date mutually agreed to in\nwriting by Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub.
