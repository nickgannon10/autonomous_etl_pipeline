            "Table of Contents\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated\nby reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. As a stockholder, you are not a third-party beneficiary of the Merger Agreement and therefore you\nmay not directly enforce any of its terms and conditions.\nThis summary may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global urge\nyou to carefully read the full text of the Merger Agreement because it is the legal document that governs the Merger. The Merger Agreement is not\nintended to provide you with any factual information about W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global. In particular, the assertions embodied in the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (and summarized below) are qualified by information in the documents that each\nof W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global filed with the SEC prior to the Effective Date, as well as by certain disclosure letters, which certain of the parties\ndelivered to other parties in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, that modify, qualify and create exceptions to the\nrepresentations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or\ncomplete as of any specified date, may apply contractual standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by\ninvestors or that is different from standards of materiality generally applicable under the U.S. federal securities laws or may not be intended as\nstatements of fact but rather as a way of allocating risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties and other\nprovisions of the Merger Agreement, and the description of such provisions in this proxy statement/prospectus, should not be read alone but\ninstead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings that each of W. P. Carey and\nCPA:18 - Global file with the SEC and the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus. See \"Where You Can Find More Information\"\nbeginning on page 171.\nThe Merger\nThe Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time, CPA:18 - Global will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as\nthe surviving entity and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey. At such time, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the\nMGCL and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the \"MLLCA\"), the separate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger will take place commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date specified by the\nparties, which will be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger\nAgreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those\nconditions) (such date, the \"Original Closing Date\"), by means of a virtual closing through the electronic exchange of signatures, or at such other\ntime and place as the parties agree in writing.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their\nnature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived, but the tenant\npurchase options with respect to CPA:18 - Global's Iberian student-housing portfolio subject to the Framework Agreement dated as of December\n20, 2019 (the \"Designated Portfolio\") have been exercised and W. P. Carey is actively working to complete the sale of the Designated Portfolio,\nthen W. P. Carey has the unilateral right to extend the Original Closing Date until the earliest to occur of (x) the second business day following the\nclosing of the sale of the Designated Portfolio\u037e (y) the first business day before August 31, 2022 and (z) the second business day following the date\non which W. P. Carey provides written notice to the CPA:18 Special Committee indicating that it no longer desires to pursue the foregoing extension\noption. If W. P. Carey exercises this extension option, the cash component of the Per Share Merger Consideration will be subject to an upward\nadjustment, as more thoroughly described below.\nThe Effective Time of the Merger will be specified in the Articles of Merger, provided that such time does not exceed 30 days after the Articles of\nMerger are accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and\n97\nTable of Contents\nTaxation of Maryland. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.\nConversion of Securities\nAs of the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\ncancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such share, the rights attaching to such share will be converted automatically into the right to\nreceive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration consisting of (i) 0.0978 (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of a validly\nissued, fully paid and non-assessable share of W. P. Carey Common Stock (the \"stock consideration\"), and (ii) $3.00 in cash, which will be reduced\nif CPA:18 - Global pays a dividend exceeding its regular quarterly dividend and may be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger\nAgreement to defer the closing of the Merger in order to complete the sale of certain CPA:18 - Global properties (including the cash, if any, paid in\nrespect of fractional shares (as more thoroughly described below), the \"cash component,\" and together with the stock consideration, the \u201cPer\nShare Merger Consideration\u201d).\nEach share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time will\nautomatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. In addition, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey subsidiary will receive any Per\nShare Merger Consideration for any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it. No fractional shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be issued\nunder the Merger Agreement. To the extent that a holder of CPA:18 Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of W.\nP. Carey Common Stock, computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder will\ninstead receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $10.45.\nBased on the number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding on the CPA:18 Record Date, W. P. Carey expects to issue approximately 13.8\nmillion shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Upon such Stock Issuance, the W. P. Carey Stockholders and the\nCPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and any W. P. Carey subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined company,\nrespectively.\nRecordation of Exchange\u037e Payment of Per Share Merger Consideration\nAs soon as practicable following the Effective Time, W. P. Carey will cause its transfer agent to record the Stock Issuance in connection with the\nMerger to the holders of CPA:18 Common Stock on W. P. Carey's stock records in accordance with the Merger Agreement. No physical share\ncertificates will be delivered. Prior to the Effective Time, W. P. Carey will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to CPA:18 -\nGlobal to act as agent for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (the \"Paying and Exchange Agent\"). W. P. Carey must take all steps\nnecessary to enable and cause the surviving entity to provide to the Paying and Exchange Agent immediately following the Effective Time the\naggregate cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon cancellation of the CPA:18 Common Stock in lieu of any fractional\nshare of W. P. Carey Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the tenth business day after the\nEffective Time, the Paying and Exchange Agent will pay to each holder of CPA:18 Common Stock the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to\nreceive for the cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration and in lieu of any fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock.\nShare Transfer Books\nAt the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of CPA:18 - Global will be closed, and no\nsubsequent transfers of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock will be registered on the share transfer books of the surviving entity.\n98\nTable of Contents\nRepresentations and Warranties\nW. P. Carey and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and CPA:18 - Global, on the other hand, have made representations and warranties in the Merger\nAgreement, many of which are qualified as to materiality or subject to matters disclosed by the parties, and none of which survive the Effective\nTime, relating to, among other things:\n\u2022organization, standing and corporate power\u037e\n\u2022capital structure\u037e\n\u2022power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and enforce the Merger Agreement and all other documents to be executed in connection with\nthe transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022no conflicts with, violations of or defaults under organizational documents, certain material contracts or applicable judgments, orders or laws\u037e\n\u2022consents and regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022information supplied relating to the disclosures in the registration statement and this proxy statement/prospectus\u037e\n\u2022opinions of financial advisors\u037e\n\u2022stockholder approval required (with respect to CPA:18 - Global only)\u037e\n\u2022brokers' fees or commissions\u037e\n\u2022no requirement to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act\u037e\n\u2022exemptions relating to takeover or similar statutes and waiver from ownership limitations in organizational documents (with respect to CPA:18 -\nGlobal only)\u037e\n\u2022availability of SEC documents, internal accounting controls, disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal controls (with\nrespect to W.

Carey has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust\n(\u201cREIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its formation as a REIT and Morgan Stanley has assumed that the Merger will not adversely\naffect such status or operations of W. P. Carey. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of\nCPA:18 - Global or W. P. Carey, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals.

Assessing any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without\nconsidering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nFurthermore, mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to\nbelow.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and relied upon certain financial\nprojections provided by the managements of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey and that are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the\n\u201cfinancial projections,\u201d and extrapolations of such financial projections, as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus titled \u201cProspective Financial Information,\u201d and certain financial projections based on Wall Street research.\nDividend Discount Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a dividend discount analysis to calculate a range of implied present values of the future forecasted dividends and an\nestimated \u201cterminal value\u201d for CPA:18 Common Stock. The range was determined by adding:\n\u2022the present value (as of December 31, 2021) of estimated future dividends for CPA:18 - Global over a period of 60 months from January 1, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2026 based on CPA:18 - Global\u2019s projected estimated dividends per share for those periods\u037e and\n\u2022the present value (as of December 31, 2021) of an estimated \u201cterminal value\u201d of CPA:18 Common Stock at the end of the year 2026.\nIn performing its analysis, Morgan Stanley used a discount rate of 8.3% to 10.3%, derived from a cost of equity calculation utilizing the capital asset\npricing model. The terminal value for CPA:18 Common Stock was calculated by applying a selected range of terminal AFFO multiples of 16.0x to\n18.0x, the midpoint of which was based on comparing the weighted average of historical next twelve months (NTM) AFFO trading multiples over\nthe last ten years of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Net Lease and Self-Storage REIT Peers, to Morgan Stanley\u2019s calculation of estimated 2027 AFFO per share of\nCPA:18 - Global of $0.58. CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Net Lease REIT Peers consisted of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc., Lexington Realty Trust, STAG Industrial,\nInc., and W. P. Carey. CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Self-Storage REIT peers include CubeSmart, Extra Space Storage Inc., Life Storage, Inc., National Storage\nAffiliates Trust, and Public Storage. This analysis resulted in the following implied per share equity value range for CPA:18 - Global:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\n$8.50 to $9.92\nComparable Public Companies Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a comparable company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded.\n49\nTable of Contents\nMorgan Stanley reviewed and compared, using publicly available information, certain current and historical financial information for CPA:18 -\nGlobal and financial projections with corresponding current and historical financial information, certain financial projections based on Wall Street\nresearch reports, ratios and public market multiples for selected companies that, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience,\nshare similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics. The companies that were reviewed in connection with\nthis analysis were CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Diversified Peers, Office / Industrial Peers and Self-Storage Peers.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated and analyzed the following statistics of each of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Diversified Peers, Office\n/ Industrial Peers and Self-Storage Peers, based on the closing share prices on February 25, 2022 (the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s valuation analysis\nof CPA:18 - Global) and publicly available financial data, for comparison purposes:\n\u2022such company\u2019s estimated AFFO for calendar year 2022, based on publicly available equity research estimates\u037e\n\u2022such company\u2019s estimated gross asset value, or GAV, based on publicly available equity research estimates\u037e\n\u2022such company\u2019s estimated net asset value, or NAV, based on publicly available equity research estimates\u037e\n\u2022the ratios of such company\u2019s share price to estimated 2022 AFFO, estimated GAV and estimated NAV.\nMorgan Stanley then used these multiple ranges to derive separate implied per share equity value reference ranges for CPA:18 - Global using each\nof the metrics reviewed by applying the range derived from the comparable companies for each metric to the corresponding CPA:18 - Global metric,\nas provided by CPA:18 - Global\u2019s management.\nBelow are descriptions of the adjustments made to determine adjusted GAV and adjusted NAV for these metrics:\nAdjusted Gross Asset Value\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the GAV estimates of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s assets prepared and published by Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. (\u201cStanger\u201d) and\nadjusted that estimate for other factors not included in their estimate, which adjustments were approved by the CPA:18 Special Committee. The\nStanger GAV estimate was $2.468 billion (as of September 30, 2021). Morgan Stanley then adjusted this estimate to reflect the estimated impact\n(pursuant to data provided by CPA:18 - Global\u2019s management) of the Iberian student housing portfolio call option (as described in further detail on\npage 59 of this proxy statement/prospectus), planned dispositions of certain of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s assets during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year\n2021 and the first (1 ) quarter of fiscal year 2022, and impairment charges during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021 to devise an adjusted\nGAV estimate of $2.443 billion.\nAdjusted Net Asset Value\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the NAV estimates for shares of CPA:18 Common Stock prepared and published by Stanger and adjusted that estimate for\nother factors not included in their estimate, which adjustments were approved by the CPA:18 Special Committee. The Stanger NAV estimate for\nshares of CPA:18 Common Stock was $9.07 (as of September 30, 2021). Morgan Stanley then adjusted this estimate to reflect the estimated impact\n(pursuant to data provided by CPA:18 - Global\u2019s management) of the Iberian student housing portfolio call option (as described in further detail on\npage 59 of this proxy statement/prospectus), redemptions of the CPA:18 Common Stock during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021, planned\ndispositions of certain of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s assets during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the first (1 ) quarter of fiscal year 2022,\nimpairment charges during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021, and change in share count attributable to CPA:18 - Global\u2019s dividend\nreinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d) and as payment for W. P. Carey asset management fees to devise an adjusted NAV estimate of $9.01 per share of\nCPA:18 Common Stock.\nth\nst\nth\nth\nth\nst\nth\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reflects the results of this analysis:\nCPA:18 - Global\nMetric\nRange\nImplied Share Price\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\n2022E AFFOx (Leverage-adjusted)\n$0.50\n17.7x\n20.4x\n$9.07\n$10.46\n% Premium / (Discount) to Adj.
