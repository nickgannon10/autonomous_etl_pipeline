Qatalyst\nPartners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including the Updated\nCompany LRP, described more fully in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d\nAdditionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior\nmanagement of the Company.

In addition, Qatalyst Partners performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered\nsuch other factors as it deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to\nthe Updated Company LRP, Qatalyst Partners was advised by Company management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Updated Company LRP\nhad been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Company management of the future financial\nperformance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners expressed no view as to such Updated Company LRP or the\nassumptions on which they were based. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement would not differ materially from the final\nexecuted merger agreement and that the merger would be consummated in accordance\n54\nTable of Contents\nwith the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay of any terms or conditions. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\nassumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed transaction, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions\nwould be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed transaction.\nQatalyst Partners relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to\nlegal, tax or regulatory matters.

The\nanalyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all\nanalyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses,\nQatalyst Partners utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts\u2019 projections of the future financial performance of the Company as of\nAugust 3, 2022 (the \u201canalyst projections\u201d) and the Updated Company LRP described more fully in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014\nCertain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular\nformat. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must\nbe read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019\nfinancial analyses.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential, present values of a share\nof Company common stock as of July 2, 2022 (which was the end of the Company\u2019s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet\ndate) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n(a)\nthe implied net present value of the Company\u2019s corresponding estimated future unlevered free cash flows, based on the Updated\nCompany LRP, for the third quarter of calendar year 2022 through calendar year 2026 (which implied present value was calculated by\nusing a range of discount rates of 11.5% to 15.5%, based on the Company\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital\u037e\n55\nTable of Contents\n(b)\nthe implied net present value of the Company\u2019s terminal value, calculated by multiplying its estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar\nyear 2027 based on the Updated Company LRP by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated EBITDA\nof 6.0x to 12.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment), and discounted to present value using the\nsame range of discount rates used in item (a) above\u037e and\n(c)\nthe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of $63,000,000 as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management\u037e and\n\u2022\nsubtracting the $35,000,000 principal amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management\u037e\nand\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by: the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, each\noutstanding as of the close of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, with each of the\nabove-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated\ndilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and\ncancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Company management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Company common stock of approximately $49.84 to\n$94.59.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company with publicly available information and\npublic market multiples for certain selected companies, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including\nthat they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or\nhave other relevant or similar characteristics.

For purposes of this analysis, Qatalyst Partners calculated the Company\u2019s\nenterprise value assuming the Company\u2019s net cash as of July 2, 2022, which was approximately $28,000,000, as provided by Company\u2019s management.\nEstimated Revenue Multiples\nBased upon the analyst projections and the Company\u2019s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E Revenue\nMultiple for the Company of 0.79x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of\n0.60x to 0.85x and applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue of $1.595 billion based on the Updated Company LRP.\nBased on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the\nclose of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCompany common stock of approximately $34.29 to $48.13 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nEstimated EBITDA Multiples\nBased upon the analyst projections and the Company\u2019s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E EBITDA\nMultiple for the Company of 12.4x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E EBITDA Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of\n7.0x to 13.0x and applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA of $94,000,000 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nBased on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the\nclose of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCompany common stock of approximately $23.78 to $43.29 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many\nof these matters are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s business and the industry in general, industry\ngrowth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in\ngeneral. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful\nmethod of using selected company data.\n57\nTable of Contents\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative\nanalyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial\nanalysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may\nhave given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less\nprobable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to\nindustry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nAny estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more\nor less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration of $61."
