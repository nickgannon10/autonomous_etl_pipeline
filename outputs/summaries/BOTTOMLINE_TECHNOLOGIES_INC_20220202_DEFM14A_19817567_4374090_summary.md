# Summary of Documents

The documents provided discuss the Termination, Confidentiality, and Indemnification provisions within a Merger Agreement context. Here’s a summary of how these provisions are addressed across the documents:

**Termination Provisions:**
The termination provisions outline various scenarios under which the Merger Agreement can be terminated:
- Mutual consent of Bottomline and Parent.
- Unmet deadlines, such as if the merger is not completed by a specified "End Date."
- Legal prohibitions by governmental orders.
- Failure of Bottomline’s stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement.
- Breach of agreement by either party that affects the closing conditions and is either incurable or not cured within a specified period.
- Superior Proposal scenarios where Bottomline might terminate to pursue a better offer, subject to a termination fee.
- Failure by Parent or Merger Sub to complete the closing under the conditions agreed.

**Confidentiality Provisions:**
Confidentiality provisions are typically designed to protect the proprietary information of the involved parties during and after the negotiation process. However, the documents provided do not explicitly detail the confidentiality provisions within the Merger Agreement. These provisions are generally standard in such agreements to ensure that sensitive information does not get disclosed to unauthorized parties, potentially damaging the involved entities.

**Indemnification Provisions:**
The indemnification provisions are quite detailed in the provided documents. They specify that:
- Parent agrees to honor existing rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses for current and former directors and officers of Bottomline and its subsidiaries for a period of six years post-merger.
- The provisions cover acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time of the merger.
- Parent will ensure that the Surviving Corporation maintains directors’ and officers’ liability
