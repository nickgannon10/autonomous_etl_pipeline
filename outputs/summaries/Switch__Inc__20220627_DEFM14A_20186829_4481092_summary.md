- Specific conditions allowing for termination include: failure to consummate the merger by the designated end date, issuance of a governmental order or law prohibiting the merger, and failure to obtain the requisite vote of stockholders.
- Each party (Switch or Parent) can also terminate the agreement unilaterally under certain conditions such as breach of representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements by the other party that affects the closing conditions of the merger.
- There are provisions for extending the termination date if certain closing conditions related to regulatory approvals and other agreements are not met.

**Indemnification Provisions:**
- Post-merger, non-employee directors and executive officers are entitled to ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies as described in the proxy statement.

**Confidentiality Provisions:**
