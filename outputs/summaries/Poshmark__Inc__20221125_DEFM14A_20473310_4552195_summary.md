# Summary of Documents

The documents provided focus on specific provisions in a Merger Agreement related to Termination, Confidentiality, and Indemnification. Hereâ€™s a summary of these provisions across the documents:

**Termination:**
The first document details the effect of termination of the Merger Agreement. It states that any valid termination will be effective immediately upon the delivery of a written notice by the terminating party. Post-termination, the agreement ceases to have any effect without liability, except for certain provisions that survive termination, including those related to termination effects, termination fees, related expenses, and general provisions contained in Article IX. The document also specifies that parties will not be relieved from liabilities arising from fraud or willful and material breach of the agreement.

**Confidentiality:**
The third document discusses confidentiality in the context of a "No-Shop" clause, which restricts the company from sharing non-public information or engaging with any parties other than those specified, regarding any acquisition proposals. However, exceptions are allowed if the Poshmark Board receives what they determine to be a Superior Proposal, in which case they can engage and share information under an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. This ensures that confidentiality is maintained unless a significantly better proposal is received under strict conditions.

**Indemnification:**
The second document mentions indemnification in the context of proxy solicitation for a special meeting. The company has agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against certain losses, damages, and expenses incurred in soliciting stockholder proxies. This provision ensures that the soliciting party is protected from potential liabilities arising from their solicitation activities.
