This summary discusses the material information contained in this proxy statement, including with respect to the
merger agreement and the merger. We encourage you to, and you should, read carefully this entire proxy statement,
its annexes and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, as this summary may
not contain all of the information that may be important to you. We have included page references to direct you to a
more complete description of the topics presented in this summary.
The Companies (page 16)
Alleghany Corporation
Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a Delaware corporation. The Company
owns operating subsidiaries and manages investments, anchored by a core position in property and casualty
reinsurance and insurance. The Company’s property and casualty subsidiaries include: Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., a
leading global reinsurer; RSUI Group, Inc., which underwrites wholesale specialty insurance coverages; and

herein. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information” on page 72.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a Delaware corporation. Berkshire is a holding company that owns
subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses
conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of

Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), trading symbols BRK.A and BRK.B. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Companies-Berkshire Hathaway Inc.” on page 16.
O&M Acquisition Corp.
O&M Acquisition Corp. (“Merger Sub”) is a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire that
was formed on March 18, 2022, solely for the purpose of entering into the merger agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Companies-O&M Acquisition Corp.” on page 16.
The Merger Proposal (page 22)
You will be asked to consider and vote upon the proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of March 20, 2022, by and among the Company, Berkshire and Merger Sub (as it may be amended from time
to time, the “merger agreement”) and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “merger”). The
merger agreement provides, among other things, that at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Berkshire. As a result of the merger, each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
“Company common stock”), issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger, other than
shares (a) held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Berkshire or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Berkshire or (b) held by a stockholder who has demanded and perfected such holder’s demand for
appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware law, will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right
to receive $848.02 in cash, without interest (the “merger consideration”).
The Special Meeting (page 17)
The special meeting will be held at The Penn Club, 30 West 44th Street, New York, New York, on June 9, 2022, at 10:00
a.m. local time.
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Record Date and Quorum (page 18)
The holders of record of the Company common stock as of the close of business on April 28, 2022 (the “record date”)
are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting.
The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the
votes entitled to be cast at the meeting will constitute a quorum, permitting the Company to conduct its business at
the special meeting.
Shares of Company common stock held by stockholders of record that submit a proxy, but fail to provide voting
instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card will be counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.
Shares of Company common stock held by stockholders in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee that do
not instruct the nominee how to vote such shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
is present at the special meeting.
Required Vote for the Merger (page 18)
Each share of Company common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote
at the special meeting.
For the Company to complete the merger, stockholders holding at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of Company common stock at the close of business on the record date must vote
“FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.
A failure to vote your shares of Company common stock or an abstention from voting for the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the merger will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.
As of the record date, there were approximately 13,454,888 shares of Company common stock issued and
outstanding.
Conditions to the Merger (page 58)

other closing conditions.
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company’s Board of Directors in Favor of the Merger (pages 26
and 29)
The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”) unanimously recommends that the
stockholders of the Company vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.
For a description of the reasons considered by the Board in deciding to recommend approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the merger, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the
Merger.”
Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor (page 29)
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the Board that, as of March 20, 2022 and based
upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $848.02 in cash per share of the Company
common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Berkshire and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Company
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 20, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs provided financial advisory services and its opinion for
the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs
opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common stock should vote with respect
to the merger or any other matter.
Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay
Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of $27 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger.
For additional information, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Opinion of the Company’s Financial
Advisor” beginning on page 29 and Annex B to this proxy statement.
Certain Effects of the Merger (page 22)
If the conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived, Merger Sub will
be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company
will continue as the surviving corporation, with all of its property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises, debts,
liabilities and duties continuing unaffected by the merger. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Company
common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger, other than shares (i) held
in the treasury of the Company or owned by Berkshire or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire
or (ii) held by a stockholder who has demanded and perfected such holder’s demand for appraisal rights in
accordance with Delaware law, will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $848.02 in
cash, without interest. Following completion of the merger, the Company common stock will no longer be publicly
traded, and the Company’s existing stockholders will cease to have any ownership interest in the Company.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards (page 48)
Restricted Stock Units. Each outstanding restricted stock unit that is not subject to any performance-based vesting
requirements (each, an “RSU”), other than any Director RSU (as defined below), including any dividend equivalent
units credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving
corporation an amount equal to the merger consideration and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will
be paid in cash to the holder of such RSU within 15 business days of the existing vesting date applicable to such
RSU if the holder continues employment through the vesting date, subject to full accelerated vesting and payment
within 15 business days (subject to any required delay in payment required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the “Code”)) of the earlier termination of the holder’s employment without cause or due to the holder’s
death, total disability or qualified retirement (which for RSUs is defined as retirement on or after attaining age 60 and
10 years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries that is approved by the Company’s chief executive officer
(or, in the case of the Company’s chief executive officer, approval by Berkshire’s chief executive officer or the
compensation committee of Berkshire’s Board of Directors) after at least 90 days’ notice from the holder of his or her
intent to retire (an “RSU Qualified Retirement”)). For any outstanding RSU that vests prior to the effective time of the
merger, the RSU consideration will be paid without interest within 15 business days of closing.
Performance Shares. Each outstanding restricted stock unit that is subject to any performance-based vesting
requirement (each, a “PSU”), other than the Match Award (as defined below), including any dividend equivalent
units credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving
corporation an amount equal to the merger consideration (assuming maximum level performance was achieved for
purposes of determining the number of PSUs) and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in
cash to the holder of such PSU at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the
completion of the applicable performance period if the holder continues employment through the end of such
performance period in accordance with the original payment terms of the award, without any ongoing performance-
vesting conditions, subject to full accelerated vesting upon the earlier termination of the holder’s employment
without cause or due to holder’s death, total disability or qualified retirement (which for PSUs is defined as retirement
on or after attaining age 60 and 10 years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries (a “PSU Qualified
Retirement”)).
Match Award. The PSUs granted under the performance share matching award to Joseph P. Brandon, the Company’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, on April 1, 2022, as contemplated by Mr. Brandon’s employment agreement
with the Company (the “Match Award”), including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto, will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount in cash equal to the
merger consideration less any required withholding taxes, payable in cash to Mr. Brandon at the time specified in the
applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr. Brandon continues
employment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment terms of the award.
However, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will not be assumed for
purposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award. Instead, the amount payable to Mr. Brandon in
respect of the Match Award will be determined based on the actual attainment of the “adjusted book value per
common share” performance goal during the Match Award’s five-year performance period ending December 31, 2026
and the actual number of PSUs earned during the performance period. The merger agreement provides for full
accelerated vesting of the right to receive the amount payable in respect of the Match Award upon the earlier
termination of Mr. Brandon’s employment without cause or due to his death, total disability or PSU Qualified
Retirement, consistent with the PSUs held by other employees.
Director Awards. Each outstanding RSU granted to our non-employee directors under the Company’s directors’ stock
plans (the “Director RSUs”), including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount equal to the merger consideration in
cash at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement or applicable deferral election.
Except as specifically noted above, each RSU, PSU and Director RSU will be credited with interest at the prime rate
from the effective time of the merger until the respective payment date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 37)
In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger, you should be aware that aside from their interests as stockholders of the Company, some of the Company’s
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other
stockholders of the Company generally. Interests of executive officers and directors that may be different from or in
addition to the interests of the Company’s stockholders include:
•
The treatment of equity awards, including assuming maximum level performance for purposes of
determining the number of PSUs held by PSU holders (other than with respect to the Match Award held by
the President and Chief Executive Officer), as of the effective time of the merger.
•
Certain of the Company’s executive officers may receive a payment or benefit, which would constitute a
“parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in which case, pursuant to the merger
agreement, the surviving corporation will provide a tax gross up (including with respect to any such gross
up payments) to such executive officer for any excise taxes imposed under Section 280G of the Code in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
•
The Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification coverage under
the merger agreement and the Company’s organizational documents.
The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement and
the merger, and in recommending to the stockholders of the Company that the merger agreement and the merger be
approved and adopted. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Background of the Merger” and
see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger.” The Company’s stockholders
should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the merger. These interests are described in more detail below in the section of the proxy
statement entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” and
certain of them are quantified in the disclosure below.
Financing (page 37)
The Company and Berkshire estimate that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger will be
approximately $11.6 billion. We understand that Berkshire intends to fund the merger consideration through available
cash.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 43)
If you are a U.S. holder, the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger
will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger
will generally not be a taxable transaction to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless you have certain
connections to the United States. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax
consequences to you of the exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light
of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other
tax laws).
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 45)
Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until
notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The
Company and Berkshire filed their respective Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Antitrust
Division and the FTC on April 6, 2022.
The merger is also reportable and subject to the approval of antitrust and competition regulators in the following
non-U.S. jurisdictions: Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan and South Africa. In addition, foreign filings
might be required in a few other non-U.S. jurisdictions which have yet to be determined by the parties.
Insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may directly or indirectly acquire control of an
insurance company unless and until that acquisition has been approved by the relevant domiciliary or other
insurance regulator of that insurance company. Pursuant to those laws and regulations, Berkshire and/or the
5
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company have filed, or will file, applications for prior approval or prior notifications relating to the various insurance
company subsidiaries of the Company with a number of state insurance regulators in the United States, the
Prudential Regulation Authority and Lloyd’s of London in the United Kingdom, the Commissariat Aux Assurances in
Luxembourg, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission in Gibraltar, the Banco Central del Paraguay in Paraguay,
the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in Australia, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
(and other provincial regulators) in Canada, the Bermuda Monetary Authority in Bermuda and the Financial Services
Authority in Japan. Further, pursuant to the insurance laws and regulations of certain U.S. states, Berkshire has
provided, or will provide, a prior notification to a number of applicable insurance regulatory authorities regarding the
likely impact of the merger on market competition in its state.
Filings will also be made by Berkshire seeking non-disapproval of the insurance department of the State of Texas
relating to the change of control of the Company’s subsidiary that is licensed as an agent in Texas which is not a
resident of Texas.
Although Berkshire and the Company do not expect the relevant insurance regulatory authorities to raise any
significant concerns in connection with their review of the merger, there is no assurance that Berkshire or the
Company, as applicable, will obtain all required insurance regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, or that these
approvals will not include a restriction, limitation or condition which, in such case, would permit Berkshire to refuse
to close the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and consummate the merger.
Dissenting Shares (page 49)
Under Delaware law, holders of Company common stock who do not vote in favor of approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the merger will have the right to seek appraisal and receive the judicially determined “fair
value” of their shares of Company common stock in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if the merger closes,
but only if they perfect their appraisal rights by precisely complying with the required procedures under the
applicable provisions of Delaware law. A copy of the Delaware statutory provisions related to appraisal rights is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and a summary of these provisions can be found under “Appraisal
Rights.” This appraisal value could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration that would have
otherwise been received for those shares.
Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock (page 46)
If the merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As such, the Company would no longer file
periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to the Company common
stock. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock.”
Go-Shop; No Solicitation by the Company (page 54)
Pursuant to the terms of a “go-shop” provision in the merger agreement, during the period beginning on the date of
the merger agreement and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on April 14, 2022 (such period, the “Go-Shop Period”),
the Company was permitted to (i) solicit, initiate or facilitate the making of alternative takeover proposals from third
parties; (ii) provide non-public information to third parties in connection with alternative takeover proposals; and (iii)
participate in discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding alternative takeover proposals. After the Go-
Shop Period, the Company has agreed not to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals relating
to alternative takeover transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, engage in discussions or negotiations
regarding, or provide any non-public information in connection with, alternative takeover proposals. As described
below, the Company has the right to terminate the merger agreement prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of
the merger to accept a “superior proposal” during or following the Go-Shop Period, subject to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement- Go-
Shop; No Solicitation by the Company.” There is no termination fee payable in the event of any termination of the
merger agreement.
Termination (page 59)
The Company and Berkshire may terminate the merger agreement by mutual written consent at any time before the
effective time of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, either the Company or Berkshire may terminate the merger agreement if:
•
the merger is not consummated on or before November 21, 2022 (as it may be extended, the “outside date”),
subject to automatic extension to not later than March 21, 2023, if all of the conditions to the completion of
the Merger other than the receipt of required regulatory approvals have been satisfied or are capable of
being satisfied;
•
a governmental entity has issued a permanent injunction or similar order which is final and non-appealable
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger, so long as the party seeking to
terminate has used the efforts required of it under the merger agreement to prevent the entry of the
permanent injunction or other order; or
•
the required vote of the stockholders of the Company to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger is not obtained at the special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements).

the required vote of the stockholders of the Company to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, as further described below under “The
Merger Agreement-Termination;” or
•
if Berkshire or Merger Sub has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in the merger agreement, such that the conditions to the Company’s obligations to complete the
merger would not be satisfied, and such breach is not cured by the outside date, as further described below
under “The Merger Agreement-Termination.”
Berkshire may also terminate the merger agreement:
•
in the event of a withdrawal or change of recommendation by the Board or if the Board approves or
recommends a takeover proposal; or

Merger Agreement-Termination.”
There are no termination fees payable upon any termination of the merger agreement.

ALLEGHANY CORP DE_20220429_DEFM14A_20052995_4452227.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting,
the merger agreement and the merger. These questions and answers may not address all of the questions that may be
important to you as a stockholder of the Company. Please refer to the more detailed information contained
elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
A:
On March 20, 2022, the Company entered into a merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire, with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation
of proxies by the Board in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and
the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting.
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Berkshire through the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company pursuant to the merger agreement. As a result of the merger, following the effective
time, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire, and you will no longer own shares in
the Company, only the right to receive the merger consideration.
Q:
What will I receive in the merger?
A:
If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $848.02 in cash, without interest, for each share of
Company common stock owned by you. For example, if you own 100 shares of Company common stock, you will
be entitled to receive $84,802.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of Company common stock. You will not be
entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Berkshire.
The merger consideration represents a multiple of 1.26 times the Company’s book value at December 31, 2021, a
29% premium to the Company’s average stock price over the 30 days prior to announcement of the merger
agreement and a 16% premium to the Company’s 52-week high closing stock price prior to the announcement of
the merger agreement.
Q:
Where and when is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will take place at The Penn Club, 30 West 44th Street, New York, New York, on June 9, 2022,
at 10:00 a.m. local time.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?
A:
You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger;
•
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be payable to the named
executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger; and
•
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger.
Q:
What vote of the Company’s stockholders is required to approve the merger agreement and the merger?
A:
Stockholders holding at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
Company common stock at the close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the special meeting must vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the merger. A failure to vote your shares of Company common stock or an abstention from voting
will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger.
8TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of the close business on April 28, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, there were 13,454,888 shares
of Company common stock issued and outstanding.
Q:
Have any significant stockholders indicated how they intend to vote at the special meeting?
A:
Jefferson W. Kirby, the Chair of our Board of Directors, controls 2.5% of the Company common stock and has
indicated that he intends to vote those shares “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement
and the merger.
Q:
How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A:
A quorum will be present if holders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting on the
close of business on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a
quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to
time until a quorum is obtained.
If you are a stockholder of record and you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on
any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.
If you hold your shares of Company common stock in “street name” with your broker, bank or other nominee
and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting since all of the proposals currently expected to
be voted on at the special meeting are considered non-routine matters.
Q:
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve other matters to be discussed at the special meeting?
A:
The advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may be payable to the named executive
officers of the Company in connection with the merger and the proposal regarding adjournment of the special
meeting each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast in person or represented
by proxy at the special meeting.
Q:
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a “street name” holder?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to
those shares. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, trust company or other nominee,
then the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect
to those shares, while you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares. In the latter case, your shares are
said to be held in “street name.”
Q:
If I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, how do I vote?
A:
If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank, trust company or
other nominee (that is, in street name), you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on
how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker or nominee. Please note
that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting
in person at the special meeting. Further, brokers who hold shares of Company common stock on behalf of their
customers may not give a proxy to the Company to vote those shares without specific instructions from their
customers.
If you are a Company stockholder who holds shares of Company common stock in “street name” and you do
not instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker may not vote your shares, which will have the
same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and,
assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the other proposals.
Q:
What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?
A:

wish to vote on any particular proposal, the Company common stock represented by your proxy will be voted in
favor of each of the proposals.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote:
•
“FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger;
•
“FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may become payable to the
named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger; and
•
“FOR” the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies.
Q:
What are some of the effects the merger will have on the Company?
A:
The Company common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is traded on the NYSE under
the symbol “Y.” As a result of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire. Following the consummation of the merger, the Company
common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will
no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to the Company common stock, in each
case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not consummated?
A:
If the merger agreement and the merger are not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the merger is not
consummated for any other reason, the Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in
connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and shares of the Company
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE.
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory proposal on executive compensation that may
become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
The approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is an
advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Berkshire. If the merger agreement and the merger are
approved by the Company’s stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be
paid to the Company’s named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Q:
What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Company common stock?
A:
We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important. If you are
a stockholder of record, you can ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your
proxy via:
•
mail, using the enclosed postage-paid envelope;
•
telephone, by calling the toll-free number listed on each proxy card; or
•
the Internet, by accessing the address provided on each proxy card.
If you are a stockholder of record and you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you
wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the merger, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may become
payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.
If you hold your shares of Company common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee,
you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted,
which will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement
and the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Can I revoke my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a
stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company’s Corporate Secretary in writing at
Alleghany Corporation, 1411 Broadway, 34th Floor, New York, New York 10018, Attention: Corporate Secretary,
or by submitting a new proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, dated after the date of the proxy
being revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting and voting in person
(simply attending the special meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your
shares in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the above-
described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you must follow the
instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote?
A:
The vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger is based on the total number of shares of
Company common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the record date, not just the
shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.
Q:
Will my shares of Company common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be
combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares of Company common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by
a different stockholder than any shares of Company common stock you hold of record, any shares of Company
common stock so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of Company common stock you
hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Company common stock in various registered forms, such as
jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign,
date and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Company common stock because they are held in a
different form of record ownership. Shares of Company common stock held by a corporation or business entity
must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares of Company common stock held in an individual
retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Company common stock before completion of the merger?
A:
If you transfer your shares of Company common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger
consideration in the merger. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of
Company common stock through completion of the merger.
The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the consummation of the
merger. So, if you transfer your shares of Company common stock after the record date but before the closing of
the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger, but you will
have retained the right to vote at the special meeting.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying
agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Company common stock
for the merger consideration. If your shares of Company common stock are held in “street name” by your broker,
bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action,
if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the merger
consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.
Q:
I do not know where my stock certificate is-how will I get the merger consideration for my shares of Company
common stock?
A:
If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will
include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an
affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. The Company may also require
that you post a bond, in such reasonable amount as the surviving corporation may direct, as indemnity against
any potential loss.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Am I entitled to exercise dissenters’ or appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my
shares of Company common stock?
A:
Yes. Under Delaware law, holders of Company common stock who do not vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger will have the right to seek appraisal and receive the judicially
determined “fair value” of their shares of Company common stock in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if
the merger closes, but only if they perfect their appraisal rights by precisely complying with the required
procedures under the applicable provisions of Delaware law. This appraisal value could be more than, the same
as, or less than the merger consideration that would have otherwise been received for those shares.
To exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, stockholders must submit a written demand for appraisal to the
Company prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, must not
vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, and must continue to
hold the shares of Company common stock of record through the effective time. Failure to comply strictly with
the procedures set forth in the applicable provisions of Delaware law will result in the loss of appraisal rights.
The text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.
We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.
Q:
Will I have to pay taxes on the merger consideration I receive?
A:
If you are a U.S. holder, the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the
merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a non-U.S. holder,
the merger will generally not be a taxable transaction to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless you
have certain connections to the United States. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the
particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to
the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or
foreign income and other tax laws).
Q:
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
A:
If your shares of Company common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you
will receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards or
voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet, if available to
you) to ensure that all of your shares of Company common stock are voted.
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance
notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of
the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of
Company common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Company
common stock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your
broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will
arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You
may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

One purpose of the special meeting is for our stockholders to consider and vote upon the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger. Our stockholders must approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, the
merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and the
material provisions of the merger agreement are described under “The Merger Agreement.”
In addition, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company is providing its stockholders with the
opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation that may be payable to its named executive
officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.” The vote
on executive compensation that may become payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from
the vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and vote not to approve the executive compensation and vice versa.
Because the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company
or Berkshire. Accordingly, because the Company is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger agreement and the
merger are adopted and approved and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote. Our stockholders are also
being asked to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the merger.
This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to stockholders on or about April 29, 2022.

section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger.”
The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote “FOR” the proposal to

entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date,
approximately 13,454,888 shares of Company common stock were issued and outstanding.
The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled
to be cast at the meeting at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum, permitting the Company
to conduct its business at the special meeting. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted
for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for an adjourned
special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions as
described below under the sub-heading “-Voting; Proxies; Revocation-Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy” will
be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting.
Shares of Company common stock held by stockholders of record that submit a proxy but fail to provide voting
instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card will be counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

Each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled
to one vote at the special meeting.
For the Company to complete the merger, stockholders holding at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of Company common stock at the close of business on the record date must vote
“FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. A failure to vote your shares of

shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and the other proposals to
be considered at the special meeting, although none of them is obligated to do so. Jefferson W. Kirby, the Chair of
Alleghany’s Board of Directors, controls 2.5% of the Company common stock (which is included in the 2.8% noted

record, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s license. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or voting instruction
form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper
identification.
Voting in Person
Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but
instead hold your shares of Company common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you
must provide a proxy executed in your favor from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to be able to vote in
person at the special meeting.
Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your shares of Company common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you
provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described
below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with
instructions for submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the
Internet by accessing the Internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of Company common
stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy
card, as described below.
Submit a Proxy Card by Mail. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is
received in time for the special meeting, your shares of Company common stock will be voted in the manner directed
by you on your proxy card.
If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless you attend the special
meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares of Company common stock will not be considered
present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, will
have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and
will not affect the vote regarding the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies, or the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may become payable to
the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger. If you sign, date and return your proxy
card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation
that may become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.
Shares of Company Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of Company common stock are held by a bank, broker or other nominee on your behalf in “street
name,” your bank, broker or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for
your shares. Many banks and brokerage firms have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by
telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting.
Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of Company common stock represented at the
special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. Abstaining from voting will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, a
vote “AGAINST” the advisory (non-binding) proposal on executive compensation that may become payable to the

If the merger agreement and merger are approved and adopted by the Company’s stockholders and the other
conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Berkshire.
Upon the consummation of the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately
before the effective time of the merger, other than shares (a) held in the treasury of the Company or owned by
Berkshire or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire or (b) held by a stockholder who has
demanded and perfected such holder’s demand for appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware law, will be cancelled
and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $848.02 in cash, without interest.
The Company common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is traded on the NYSE under the
symbol “Y.” As a result of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be wholly
owned by Berkshire. Following the consummation of the merger, the Company common stock will be delisted from the
NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer be required to file periodic reports
with the SEC with respect to the Company common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and
regulations.
Background of the Merger",30,30
ALLEGHANY CORP DE_20220429_DEFM14A_20052995_4452227.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of their ongoing evaluation of the Company’s business, the Board and the Company’s senior management
periodically review and assess the Company’s operations, financial performance, total stockholder return, and
prospects in light of industry conditions and the general economic environment and their potential impact on the
Company’s long-term strategic goals and plans, which review and assessment includes potential opportunities for
business combinations, acquisitions, dispositions and other financial and strategic alternatives. Over the past few
years, the Board has evaluated, and senior management has had conversations with third parties regarding, a
disposition, spin-off and/or initial public offering of each of the Company’s Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., RSUI Group,
Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. businesses.
On the evening of March 7, 2022, Mr. Brandon and Warren E. Buffett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Berkshire, met for dinner in New York City. Mr. Brandon, who took office as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer as
of December 31, 2021 and previously had worked with Mr. Buffett as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Berkshire’s subsidiary General Re Corporation, had sent Mr. Buffett a copy of the annual letter to the Company’s
stockholders, which accompanied the Company’s annual report, as the Company had done from time to time in prior
years. Following receipt of the annual letter from Mr. Brandon, on February 25, 2022, Mr. Buffett suggested that they
get together in New York or Nebraska.
After some casual conversation at the March 7 dinner meeting, Mr. Buffett conveyed Berkshire’s interest in acquiring
the Company for $850 per share of common stock in cash, less any fee payable to the Company’s financial advisor, if
the Board were interested in pursuing a transaction. He stated that Berkshire’s offer was not subject to any financing
condition or any geopolitical risks and that Berkshire would not need to conduct any due diligence. Mr. Buffett
indicated that if the Board were interested in pursuing a transaction at that price, Berkshire’s offer would be subject
to both parties moving quickly to negotiate and announce a transaction. Mr. Buffett indicated that Berkshire would
be willing to agree to a “go-shop” pursuant to which the Company would be able to solicit alternative proposals
following execution of a merger agreement with Berkshire. Mr. Brandon said that he would convey Mr. Buffett’s offer
to the Board, and would let him know if it were interested in pursuing a potential transaction.
Later on the evening of March 7, Mr. Brandon informed Jefferson W. Kirby, the Chair of the Board, and Christopher
K. Dalrymple, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, of Berkshire’s proposal. Mr.
Kirby and Mr. Brandon agreed to call a special meeting of the Board to convey the offer and determine whether to
proceed with further discussions.
On March 8, 2022, the Board met by videoconference with members of senior management and representatives of
Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP (“Willkie”), outside legal counsel to the Company. Mr. Brandon provided a
22TABLE OF CONTENTS
summary of his discussion with Mr. Buffett and described the terms of Berkshire’s offer. Representatives of Willkie
and Mr. Dalrymple reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with considering a potential sale of the
Company. The Board determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company to engage in discussions with
Berkshire about a potential sale of the Company. Accordingly, the Board authorized Mr. Kirby and Mr. Brandon to
engage in discussions with representatives of Berkshire about a potential transaction. In light of potential conflicts of
interest of the Company’s employees that may arise in connection with a sale of the Company, the Board directed that
any negotiations with Mr. Buffett or other representatives of Berkshire should include Mr. Kirby. The Board
discussed engaging a financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction to provide advice, render a
fairness opinion in the event a transaction were agreed to and advise on and coordinate the outreach to potential
acquirors during the potential “go-shop” process. The Board discussed the merits of engaging Goldman Sachs
versus other financial advisors in light of the Berkshire proposal that explicitly deducted the financial advisory fee
(on a per share basis) from the price per share to be received by the Company’s stockholders. The Board considered
that Goldman Sachs has extensive knowledge of the industries in which the Company operates and significant
experience advising companies similar to the Company in connection with potential strategic transactions, and had
previously advised the Company in connection with the evaluation of several strategic transactions and thus knew
the Company well and was well known to the Company and its management, which would allow Goldman Sachs to
meet the anticipated timeline without sacrificing thoroughness. The Board discussed the desire for confidentiality
and the possibility of public disclosure if multiple potential investment banks were contacted. The Board determined
that in light of the foregoing factors, Mr. Brandon should contact Goldman Sachs to discuss its potential engagement
and its fee.
In an executive session of the non-employee directors, the Board again discussed potential conflicts of interest
arising out of a sale of the Company, including in connection with any amounts that would be payable to
management as a result of a sale transaction and any future employment of management with the potential buyer,
taking into account that Mr. Brandon had previously worked with Mr. Buffett as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of Berkshire’s subsidiary General Re Corporation. The non-employee directors reiterated that in light of these
potential conflicts, there should be no discussions with Berkshire regarding management’s possible post-closing
employment with the potential buyer or any amounts payable to management as a result of a transaction until after
the price per share and other material terms of any transaction had been agreed upon, and that Mr. Kirby should
participate in any price negotiations going forward if and when they occurred.
On March 10, 2022, Mr. Brandon and Mr. Dalrymple communicated to Mr. Buffett the Board’s willingness for the
Company to pursue discussions regarding a potential transaction with Berkshire. They agreed that the next step
would be for Mr. Kirby and Mr. Brandon to meet with Mr. Buffett in Nebraska. Later that day, the Company and
Berkshire executed a confidentiality agreement which contained a customary standstill provision.
On March 12, 2022, Mr. Kirby and Mr. Brandon met with Mr. Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska. Mr. Buffett confirmed the
terms of his original offer and underscored Berkshire’s ability to provide closing certainty, reiterating that the offer
was not subject to any due diligence nor would the closing be contingent upon Berkshire obtaining third-party
financing. Mr. Brandon left the meeting and Mr. Kirby then met with Mr. Buffett one-on-one. Mr. Kirby asked Mr.
Buffett to increase the price by increasing the $850 price per share or potentially by eliminating the deduction to the
merger consideration for the fee payable to the financial advisor. Mr. Kirby also asked Mr. Buffett if he would
consider using Berkshire’s stock as a portion of the deal consideration. Mr. Buffett reiterated the terms of his original
offer, indicating firmly he did not intend to change his position on those points.
On March 13, 2022, the Board met by videoconference with members of senior management and Willkie. Mr. Kirby
and Mr. Brandon provided an update on their March 12 meeting with Mr. Buffett. Representatives from Willkie
provided an overview of a potential transaction timeline, including the Company’s ability to solicit alternative
proposals after signing during the Go-Shop Period, to receive unsolicited proposals during the subsequent “no-
shop” period up until the date of the special meeting of stockholders, and the process to obtain required regulatory
approvals. Willkie reviewed and the Board discussed its fiduciary duties. At the Board’s request, representatives of
Goldman Sachs reviewed Mr. Buffett’s offer relative to the Company’s historical and projected performance and its
valuation (using several customary financial metrics), led a discussion about the insurance industry and general
M&A trends, ongoing inflation concerns and uncertain geopolitical conditions, and discussed a number of strategic
alternatives including remaining as a stand-alone public company. Goldman Sachs also reviewed other potential
acquirors of the Company and sale process alternatives. Goldman

Sachs then left the meeting and the Board authorized continued discussions about a potential transaction with
Berkshire and the engagement of Goldman Sachs as financial advisor for a fee of $27 million (representing $1.98 per
share of Company common stock, or 0.23% of the $850 per share price), understanding that the financial advisory fee
would be deducted from the per share price and that Goldman Sachs’ role in advising the Board would be
instrumental in ensuring a full and fair process consistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties, including soliciting
alternative proposals following the announcement of any transaction with Berkshire in search of the highest price
reasonably available. Representatives from Willkie reviewed information regarding certain relationships that Goldman
Sachs had with Berkshire and its affiliates, as more fully described on page 29. After participating in a private session
with the Board, Mr. Brandon was excused, following which the Board and representatives from Willkie discussed in
an executive session the transaction and the timeline to potentially execute the merger agreement and to consummate
a merger transaction.
Later on the evening of March 13, 2022, the Company executed an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs.
On March 14, 2022, Munger, Tolles and Olson LLP, outside legal counsel to Berkshire (“Munger”), and Willkie
discussed drafting responsibilities among the lawyers and the anticipated timeline to execute a merger agreement.
That afternoon, Munger sent Willkie an initial draft of the merger agreement that, among other things, included a 25-
day “go-shop” provision, with a right for Berkshire to match any superior proposal with five business days’ notice,
but no termination fee would be payable by the Company if, prior to the approval of the merger agreement by the
Company’s stockholders, the Company were to terminate the agreement in favor of a superior proposal either during
the “go-shop” period or thereafter. The draft merger agreement also proposed an outside date six months after the
signing date, with the option to extend such date for 60 days to obtain any required regulatory approvals not
received as of the outside date. The treatment of outstanding Company equity awards was not addressed in the draft.
Later on March 14, 2022, senior management and Mr. Kirby informed Mr. Buffett and Marc D. Hamburg, Chief
Financial Officer, Secretary and Senior Vice President of Berkshire, that the Company had engaged Goldman Sachs,
and had agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a financial advisory fee if a transaction were consummated of $27 million,
which is the equivalent of $1.98 per share of Company common stock.
On March 15, 2022, representatives of Willkie and Munger discussed Munger’s initial draft of the merger agreement,
particularly the deduction from the purchase price of the financial advisory fee, the 25-day “go-shop” period, the five
business day match right for Berkshire subsequent to a superior offer, the lack of a termination fee payable to
Berkshire in the event there is a superior offer and the agreement is terminated, the terms of the regulatory approval
provisions and the lack of a reverse termination fee in the event regulatory approval is not obtained, and the outside
date of six months after signing with one 60-day extension to obtain regulatory approvals.
On March 16, 2022, Willkie sent Munger a revised draft of the merger agreement. Willkie’s draft included a “go-shop”
period of 35 days and eliminated Berkshire’s matching right. The draft also included an outside date of eight months
after signing with two automatic 60-day extensions, revisions to the regulatory approval provisions and a reverse
termination fee that would be payable by Berkshire to the Company if the Company were to terminate the merger
agreement due to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals prior to the outside date.
On March 17, 2022, the Board met by videoconference with senior management and representatives from Willkie and
Goldman Sachs. Willkie reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties in the context of considering a potential sale of the
Company and summarized the material terms of the merger agreement, including unresolved points relating to the
length of the “go-shop” period and inclusion of a match right, the absence of a reverse termination fee due to
regulatory approval failure, and the outside date and any permitted extension for regulatory approval. Willkie noted
that Berkshire did not propose that the Company pay a termination fee if the Company were to terminate the merger
agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from another acquiror, whether the superior proposal came during
the “go-shop” period or thereafter during the “no-shop” period up until the actual date of the special meeting of
stockholders to approve the sale of the Company. The Board discussed that the absence of a termination fee was
highly unusual and favorable to the Company because termination fees made it more expensive for alternative
acquirors to acquire a company and could discourage bidders from submitting proposals during a “go-shop” period
or thereafter during the “no-shop” period. Willkie discussed the lack of a reverse termination fee that would be
payable by Berkshire to the Company if antitrust or other regulatory approvals were not received.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Representatives from Goldman Sachs reviewed potential alternatives that could be available to the Company as an
alternative to the status quo or a transaction with Berkshire, including the potential sale or spin-out of one or more of
the Company’s business units, and each alternative’s potential value, execution risk and associated timing
considerations and costs. The Board considered the merits and risks of contacting other potential acquirors prior to
signing, including the risk that Berkshire, in light of Mr. Buffett’s past statements that Berkshire avoids auction
processes and Berkshire’s track record of not participating in auctions, would withdraw its proposal, and the risk of a
leak from such outreach and the impact of such a leak on the process for signing of a definitive agreement. After this
discussion, the Board decided that the potential benefit of contacting other potential acquirors prior to signing was
outweighed by the risks and that relying on the Company’s ability to solicit and consider superior proposals from an
alternative acquiror after the announcement of a transaction with Berkshire without the prospect of having to pay
Berkshire a termination fee if the Company were to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal
would be the appropriate strategy to pursue in the Company’s circumstances. In an executive session attended by
the non-employee directors and representatives of Willkie, the Board discussed a memorandum prepared by senior
management outlining a proposal for the treatment of outstanding Company equity awards upon the closing of the
merger, and authorized senior management to communicate the proposal to Berkshire.
On March 17, 2022, Munger sent Willkie a revised draft of the merger agreement and thereafter Willkie and Munger
finalized the open points of the transaction. After discussion and negotiation, the draft merger agreement provided
for a 25-day “go-shop” period with two business days’ notice, no termination fees would be payable upon
termination of the merger agreement and an outside date of eight months after the signing date with two automatic
60-day extensions thereof to obtain any regulatory approvals not received as of the outside date.
On March 18, 2022, senior management and Mr. Kirby communicated to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Hamburg the Board-
authorized proposal for the treatment of outstanding Company equity awards upon the closing of the merger. The
proposal provided that (i) each outstanding RSU (other than Director RSUs) would be valued at the merger
consideration and paid out in cash on the existing vesting schedule following the closing, (ii) each outstanding PSU
(other than the Match Award) would be valued at the merger consideration (assuming maximum level of performance
was achieved) and paid to holders following the completion of the applicable performance period, (iii) each
outstanding PSU under the Match Award held by Mr. Brandon would be subject to the same treatment as other PSUs
except that in lieu of assuming maximum level performance, the amount of cash payable in respect of the Match
Award would be determined based on actual attainment of the applicable performance goal during the applicable
performance period, and (iv) each outstanding Director RSU of the Company would be valued at the merger
consideration and paid to the holders at the same time as specified in the applicable plan and award agreement.
Subsequently, Berkshire agreed with the material terms of this proposal, and Willkie and Munger reflected the terms
in the merger agreement.
On March 20, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference attended by the Company’s senior management
and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Willkie. Representatives of Willkie reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties
and other legal matters in connection with the Board’s consideration of the proposed merger agreement, and
reviewed with the Board the terms of the proposed merger agreement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then
reviewed and discussed its financial analyses with respect to the Company and the proposed merger. Thereafter, at
the request of the Board, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Board (which was subsequently confirmed
in writing by delivery of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion dated the same date) as to, as of March 20, 2022, the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company common stock, other than Berkshire and its
affiliates, of the merger consideration to be received by such stockholders in the merger pursuant to the merger
agreement.
The Board considered the benefits and costs to stockholders of capturing and monetizing the value of the business
through Berkshire’s all-cash proposal, versus the risks and opportunities of continuing on a stand-alone basis or
soliciting proposals for various divestiture alternatives such as the sale or spin out of one or more of the Company’s
business units. The Board considered the terms of the merger agreement that would allow the Company to solicit and
entertain third-party proposals following the execution and announcement of the merger agreement, without the
prospect of having to pay a termination fee if the Board were to pursue an alternative proposal that was superior to
the merger with Berkshire, no matter when the superior proposal was received prior
25
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the special meeting of stockholders to approve the sale of the Company. After discussion, the Board concluded
that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to secure the benefits of the proposed
transaction with Berkshire, while retaining the ability to pursue and accept a superior proposal following
announcement of a transaction with Berkshire.
The Board unanimously approved the merger agreement as being in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and unanimously authorized the execution and delivery of the merger agreement.
That evening, the Company and Berkshire executed the merger agreement.
On the morning of March 21, 2022, prior to the commencement of trading on the NYSE, the Company and Berkshire
issued a joint press release announcing the transaction and their execution of a definitive merger agreement.
On or about March 21, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs began the “go-shop”
process. During the “go-shop” process, 23 potential strategic bidders and 8 potential financial sponsor bidders were
contacted about their potential interest in submitting a proposal for a transaction with the Company that would be
superior to the one contemplated in the merger agreement with Berkshire. Despite these efforts, at the expiration of
the “go-shop” process, the Company did not receive any alternative acquisition proposals.
Reasons for the Merger",30,34
ALLEGHANY CORP DE_20220429_DEFM14A_20052995_4452227.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger,"Reasons for the Merger
As described above in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Background of the Merger,” prior to and in
reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger, the Board consulted with and received
the advice of Goldman Sachs and Willkie, discussed certain issues with the Company’s management and considered
a variety of factors weighing positively in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, each of which the directors
believed supported their decision, including the following material factors:
•
the current and historical market prices of the Company common stock, including the market performance of
the Company common stock relative to general market indices and to other property and casualty
reinsurance and insurance companies, in particular in light of the fact that the Company’s reinsurance and
insurance subsidiaries constituted 84.3% of its stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2021, and that the
$848.02 per share price to be paid in cash in respect of each share of Company common stock, which
represented a premium of 25.3% over the closing price of the Company common stock on March 18, 2022
(the last trading day prior to the Board’s approval of the merger agreement), a premium of 29% over the
volume-weighted average closing share price of the Company common stock during the 30 days prior to
the Board’s approval of the merger agreement, and a valuation of the Company at a multiple of 1.26 times
the Company’s book value at December 31, 2021;
•
that the merger consideration of $848.02 in cash per share (representing $850.00 per share less the financial
advisory fee due to Goldman Sachs) is likely to be more favorable to the Company’s stockholders than the
potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including, but
not limited to: an acquisition by a different buyer; dispositions of certain subsidiaries of the Company;
acquisitions by the Company of other businesses; and the continued operation of the Company on a
stand-alone basis taking into account its prospects, in each of the foregoing cases, in light of a number of
factors, including the risks, costs, challenges, timing considerations and uncertainty associated with those
alternatives;
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company to explore a superior proposal, including:
○
the Company’s ability to solicit alternative proposals during the Go-Shop Period, to receive
unsolicited proposals during the no-shop period and to furnish information to and engage in
negotiations with third parties under the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as more fully
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Go Shop; No
Solicitation by the Company” beginning on page 54;
26TABLE OF CONTENTS
○
the Board’s ability to consider, and under certain conditions, to accept, a superior proposal, subject to
certain notice requirements and matching rights in favor of Berkshire, and the Company’s
corresponding right to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for such superior proposal, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement;
and
○
the absence of a termination fee during both the Go-Shop Period and the no-shop period, which the
Board believed would make it more likely for potential acquirors to consider making a superior
proposal for a business combination with the Company;
•
the Board’s understanding of the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings, historical
and projected financial performance, competitive position and the nature of the industries in which the
Company competes, including the risks, uncertainties and challenges facing the Company in the
reinsurance industry, including elevated inflation concerns, geopolitical uncertainty, increasing capital
requirements, low interest rates and potential higher than expected insured losses;
•
the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Board by representatives of Goldman Sachs as well
as the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board on March 20, 2022 (which was subsequently
confirmed in writing by delivery of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion dated the same date) to the effect that,
as of such date and based upon and subject to the various matters, limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received in the merger by the holders of
Company common stock, other than Berkshire and its affiliates, was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders, as more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Opinion of
Goldman Sachs;”
•
the Board’s assessment, taking into account the foregoing factors, of the Company’s value on a stand-
alone basis relative to the $848.02 per share in cash to be paid in the merger;
•
the potential regulatory, commercial and financing issues that might arise in connection with pursuing a
transaction with other potential parties that might have an interest in engaging in a strategic transaction
with the Company, and whether any of those potential parties would be financially capable of executing
such a transaction;
•
the fact that the consideration to be paid by Berkshire is all cash, which provides certainty of value and
liquidity to the Company’s stockholders immediately upon the closing of the merger, especially when
viewed against the risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company’s businesses, including long-term
business and execution risks and uncertainty in global economic conditions;
•
the fact that the merger is not subject to approval by Berkshire’s stockholders;
•
Berkshire’s track record in successfully acquiring other companies, Berkshire’s market capitalization and
financial strength, the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement, the fact that Berkshire has
the financial capacity to consummate the merger and the Company’s ability to seek specific performance to
prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of the merger agreement;
•
the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, taken as a whole, provide protection against the risk that
the consummation of the merger is delayed or that the merger cannot be completed due to required
regulatory approvals, based on, among other things:
○
the covenants contained in the merger agreement obligating each of the parties to use reasonable best
efforts to cause the merger to be consummated and to take certain actions to resolve potential
objections under any antitrust laws;
○
the absence of any expected significant substantive antitrust or other regulatory risks with respect to
the consummation of the merger and the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals;
and
○
the provision of the merger agreement that allows the end date for completing the merger to be
extended to January 21, 2023, if the merger has not been completed by the initial November 21, 2022
deadline, and if needed, extended again to March 21, 2023 if the merger has not been

completed by January 21, 2023 because (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any

certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, not all notifications and filings have been made, not all appropriate
waiting periods have expired or been terminated or not all clearances and approvals have been granted
by the relevant governmental entity, or (iii) not all authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or
declarations or filings with, any relevant insurance regulator shall have been filed, have occurred or
have been obtained;
•
the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, taken as a whole, including the parties’ representations,
warranties and covenants, and the conditions to the parties’ respective obligations, are reasonable; and
•
the fact that a vote of the Company’s stockholders is required under Delaware law to approve the merger
agreement, and that, under the Company’s certificate of incorporation, a vote of stockholders holding at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the Company common stock is required to approve
the merger agreement.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and countervailing factors related to the
merger agreement and the merger, including the following material factors:
•
the possibility that the merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all due to a failure of
certain conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the merger, including with respect to the required
approval of the transaction by antitrust and insurance regulatory authorities, which is beyond the
Company’s control, and by the Company’s stockholders;
•
the risks and costs to the Company if the merger does not close in a timely manner or at all, including the
potential negative impact on the Company’s ability to retain key employees, the diversion of management
and employee attention, the potential disruptive effect on the Company’s day-to-day operations and the
Company’s business relationships, and the market’s perception of the Company’s prospects, which could
lead to a decline in the price of Company common stock;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the consummation of the merger, which
may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other
action that it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of the Company pending completion of
the merger;
•
the fact that the stockholders of the Company will have no ongoing equity interest in the surviving
corporation following the merger, meaning that the stockholders will not participate in Berkshire’s or the
Company’s future earnings or growth, if any, or in the value of the common stock, and will not participate in
any potential future sale of the Company to a third party;
•
the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and delays resulting from seeking governmental
consents and approvals necessary for completion of the merger;
•
the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the Company’s ability to solicit or participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding alternative business combination transactions following the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period, subject to specified exceptions, and that require the Company to
negotiate with Berkshire (if Berkshire desires to negotiate) prior to the Company being able to terminate the
merger agreement to accept a superior proposal;
•
the likelihood of distracting litigation from shareholder suits in connection with the merger or attempts by
shareholders to discourage a vote in favor of the merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and completing the
merger, including in connection with any litigation that may result from the announcement or pendency of
the merger, and the fact that if the merger is not consummated the Company may be required to bear such
costs; and
•
the fact that the receipt of cash by stockholders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the
merger will be taxable to the Company’s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition to considering the factors described above, the Board also identified and considered a variety of other
factors, including the following:
•
the prior relationships between Goldman Sachs and Berkshire, including the fact that Goldman Sachs
disclosed to the Board information regarding such relationships; and
•
the fact that the Company’s executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s stockholders generally, including those interests that are a
result of employment and compensation arrangements with the Company, as described more fully below in
the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes
the material factors considered by the Board. The Board collectively reached the conclusion to approve the merger
agreement and deem the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company, in light of the various factors described above
and other factors that the members of the Board believed were appropriate. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the
Board did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to
whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate
determination of the Board. Rather, the Board made its recommendation based on the totality of the information
available to the Board, including discussions with, and questioning of, the Company’s management and the financial
and legal advisors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual members of the Board may have given
different weights to different factors.
This explanation of the Board’s reasons for recommending the approval of the merger agreement and other
information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the
factors described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements” beginning on page 14.
Recommendation of the Company’s Board of Directors
After careful consideration, the Board has unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement, the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders.
The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote “FOR” the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.",34,37

Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of March 20, 2022 and based upon and subject to the
factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $848.02 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the
holders (other than Berkshire and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Company common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 20, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs provided financial advisory services and its opinion for
the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs
opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common stock should vote with respect
to the merger or any other matter.
29TABLE OF CONTENTS
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman
Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the merger agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years
ended December 31, 2021;
•
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by management of the Company,
as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the Company, referred to in this section as the “Forecasts” which
are summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” beginning on page 35.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their
assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Company common stock; compared certain financial and stock
market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the insurance and
reinsurance industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such
other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Company’s consent, relied upon and assumed the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to,
discussed with or reviewed by it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that
regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company’s consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. Goldman Sachs
did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative
or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was
not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs is not an actuary and Goldman Sachs’ services
did not include any actuarial determination or evaluation by Goldman Sachs or any attempt to evaluate actuarial
assumptions and Goldman Sachs relied on the Company’s actuaries with respect to reserve adequacy. In that regard,
Goldman Sachs made no analysis of, and expressed no opinion as to, the adequacy of the loss and loss adjustments
expenses reserves of the Company. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected
benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the merger will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or
condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger
or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company;
nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Prior to the entry into the merger agreement,
Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an
acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $848.02
in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Berkshire and its affiliates) of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not
express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any
term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or
amended in connection with the merger, including, the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in
connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the
Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether
relative to the $848.02 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Berkshire
and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any
opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Company common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential
effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Berkshire or the merger, or as to the
impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of the Company, Berkshire or Merger Sub, or the ability of the
Company, Berkshire or Merger Sub to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs. In addition, Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based
on economic, monetary, market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of,
the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion
based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board in connection
with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described
represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text
of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise
noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as
it existed on or before March 18, 2022, the last trading day prior to the date that Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion
to the Board, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Illustrative Dividend Discount Analysis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative dividend discount analysis on the Company to derive a
range of illustrative values per share for the Company’s fully diluted shares of Company common stock. Goldman
Sachs discounted the estimated capital return to shareholders (in the form of dividend streams and share
repurchases) from the Company for the period 2022 through 2024 as reflected in the Forecasts, which contemplate
only share repurchases and no dividends, and the range of terminal values to derive present values, as of December
31, 2021, for the Company. Goldman Sachs calculated a range of terminal values for the Company by applying P/BV
multiples ranging from 0.90x to 1.20x to the projected book value per share (including accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”)) of the Company in 2024 as reflected in the Forecasts. These illustrative P/BV
multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into
account, among other things, the current and historical observed P/BV multiples for the Company. Goldman Sachs
used a range of discount rates from 9.2% to 10.4%, reflecting estimates of the Company’s cost of equity. Goldman
Sachs derived such estimated cost of equity by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the U.S. financial
markets generally. This analysis implied a value of $599 to $807 per share of Company common stock (rounded to the
nearest $1.00) as of December 31, 2021 (based on fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding as of
March 18, 2022, as provided by the Company’s management).
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share
of Company common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future
value of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s financial multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs
used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated and implied a range of
theoretical future values per share of Company common stock as of December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2024,
by applying illustrative P/BV multiples ranging from 0.90x to 1.20x to the Company’s projected book value per share
of Company common stock (including AOCI) as of December 31 of each such year, per the Forecasts. These
illustrative multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into
account current and historical observed P/BV multiples for the Company. Goldman Sachs then discounted to present
value as of December 31, 2021 both the range of theoretical future values per share it derived for the Company and
the estimated dividends to be paid per share of Company common stock through the end of the applicable period as
reflected in the Forecasts using a discount rate of 9.8%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s cost of equity.
Goldman Sachs derived such estimated cost of equity by application of the capital asset pricing model, which
requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the
U.S. financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $567 to $791 per share
of Company common stock (rounded to the nearest $1.00).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to certain acquisition transactions announced
since 2014 involving target companies in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry.
For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared: (i) the equity value of each
transaction as a multiple of the target company’s book value (including AOCI) as reported or calculated using
publicly available financial information for the most recent financial period reporting date prior to the announcement
(“P/BV multiples”) of the applicable transaction. While none of the target companies in the selected transactions are
directly comparable to the Company and none of the selected transactions are directly comparable to the merger, the
target companies in the selected transactions are companies with certain operations that, for the purposes of
analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations of P/BV multiples and Goldman Sachs’ professional judgment and
experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of price to book value (including AOCI) multiples of 1.12x to
1.36x (representing the 25th and 75th percentile premium, respectively, of the implied price to book value multiples
calculated for the transactions as described above) to the Company’s December 31, 2021 fully diluted book value
(including AOCI) per share of Company common stock of approximately $673.39 (based on fully diluted shares of
Company common stock outstanding as of March 18, 2022, as provided by the Company’s management) to derive a
range of implied values per share of Company common stock of $756 to $914 (rounded to the nearest $1.00).
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash
acquisition transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2017 through March 18, 2022 involving
targets that were public companies based in the U.S. in which the disclosed enterprise values for the transactions
were greater than $1.0 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated
the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the premia paid in the 231 acquisitions announced during such
period relative to the target’s closing stock price one day prior to the original announcement date of the transaction.
This analysis indicated (i) a median premium of approximately 29.5%, (ii) a 25th percentile premium of approximately
16.5% and (iii) a 75th percentile premium of approximately 53.0% across the period. Using this analysis and its
professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 16.5% to
53.0% to the closing price per share on March 18, 2022 of $676.75 and calculated a range of implied values per Share
of $788 to $1,035 (rounded to the nearest $1.00).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or
Berkshire or the merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board as to the
fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders (other than Berkshire and its
affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Company common stock of the $848.02 in cash per share of Company common
stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals
nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based
upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective
advisors, none of the Company, Berkshire, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecasts.
The consideration of $848.02 in cash per share of Company common stock was determined through arm’s-length
negotiations between the Company and Berkshire and was approved by the Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice
to the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of
consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and
trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various
persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in
which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold
or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Berkshire, any of their respective affiliates and third
parties, including affiliates of Warren Buffett, a significant shareholder of Berkshire (the “Significant Shareholder”) or
any currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman
Sachs acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and has participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting
services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Goldman Sachs Investment Banking
Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a book runner with respect to a
public offering of the Company’s 3.25% senior unsecured notes due August 2051 (aggregate principal amount
$500,000,000) in July 2021; and as a book runner with respect to a public offering of the Company’s 3.625% senior
unsecured notes due May 2030 (aggregate principal amount $500,000,000) in May 2020. During the two-year period
ended March 20, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has also been engaged by Berkshire or its
affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized
compensation, including having acted as a book runner with respect to a public offering by Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corporation, a subsidiary of Berkshire, of its investment grade bonds due in 2051 (aggregate principal
amount $925,000,000) in March 2021; as a book runner with respect to a public offering of Berkshire’s JPY-
denominated senior notes (aggregate principal amount $2,316,000,000) in April 2020; and as a book runner with
respect to a public offering of Burlington Northern

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Santa Fe Corporation’s investment grade bonds (aggregate principal amount $575,000,000) in April 2020. Goldman
Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Berkshire, the
Significant Shareholder and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division may
receive compensation.
The Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to an engagement letter,
dated March 13, 2022, as amended, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection
with the merger. The engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of
$27 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to
indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against certain liabilities that may arise out of Goldman Sachs’
engagement.

In the ordinary course of business and not in connection with the merger, management of the Company prepared
certain unaudited prospective financial information of the Company for the fiscal years 2022 through 2024, which
information is referred to as the “Projections.” The Projections were prepared in the ordinary course for internal use
only and not for public disclosure and were provided to the Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and
evaluating the merger. The Projections were also provided to and approved by the Company for use by, Goldman
Sachs, the Company’s financial advisor, for the purposes of its respective financial analysis and fairness opinion, as
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor.”
The projections were not provided to Berkshire in connection with its consideration and evaluation of the merger.
The Company does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future book value, earnings or other
results available due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance
for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates.
The Projections are not included in this proxy statement to influence any decision on whether to vote for the merger
proposal, but rather we have included a summary of these Projections below to give our stockholders access to
certain nonpublic information provided to the Board and our financial advisor in connection with the merger. The
inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, the Company, Berkshire, Merger
Sub, their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this
information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of actual future results.
The Projections reflect numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant
economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond the Company’s control. As a result, there can be no assurance
that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. The
Projections were prepared for internal use and were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward
compliance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC
or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of prospective financial information. The Projections included in this proxy statement have been
prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, has neither examined, compiled nor performed any procedures with
respect to the accompanying prospective financial information, and accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express
an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement relates to the Company’s historical financial information. It does not extend to the
Projections and should not be read to do so.
Projections of this type are based on estimates and assumptions in many respects, and as a result, subject to
interpretation. While presented with numeric specificity, these Projections were based on numerous variables and
assumptions (including, but not limited to, industry performance and competition and general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to the Company’s businesses) that are inherently
subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of our management. Important factors that may affect actual
results and cause these Projections to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating
to our business (including its ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods),

performance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in the “Risk Factors” section of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are filed
with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. Also see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.” These Projections also reflect numerous variables, expectations
and assumptions available at the time they were prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.
As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in these Projections. Since the Projections cover
multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the forecasted results summarized below will be realized.
The Projections contain certain adjusted financial measures that our management believes the most meaningful and
useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use financial information in evaluating the performance
of the Company. The adjusted financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or
superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. While we believe these adjusted
financial measures provide meaningful and useful information to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who
use financial information in evaluating the performance of the Company, there are limitations associated with the use
of these adjusted financial measures. These adjusted financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP,
and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for
comparison purposes. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of an adjusted financial measure to
a GAAP financial measure do not apply to adjusted financial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial
advisor in connection with a proposed business combination such as the merger if the disclosure is included in a
document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of adjusted financial measures were not relied
upon by our Board or our financial advisor in connection with their respective evaluation of the merger. Accordingly,
we have not provided a reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures included in the Projections to the relevant
GAAP financial measures.

Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the Projections
set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the information included

For the foregoing reasons, as well as the basis and assumptions on which the Projections were compiled, the
inclusion of specific portions of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that
the Projections will necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and they should not be relied on as such. Except
as required by applicable securities laws, the Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections
or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the
occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.

In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger, you should be aware that aside from their interests as stockholders of the Company, the Company’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other
stockholders of the Company generally. Members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests, among
other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to the
stockholders of the Company that the merger agreement and the merger be approved and adopted. See the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Background of the Merger” and the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons
for the Merger.” The Company’s stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote
“FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. These interests are described in
more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the disclosure below.
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
As described below under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of
Company Equity Awards,” equity-based awards held by the Company’s directors and executive officers immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger will be treated at the effective time of the merger as follows:
Restricted Stock Units. Each outstanding RSU, other than Director RSUs, including any dividend equivalent units
credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an
amount equal to the merger consideration and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in cash
to the holder of such RSU within 15 business days of the existing vesting date applicable to such RSU if the holder
continues employment through the vesting date. In addition, the merger agreement provides for full accelerated
vesting and payment of such amount within 15 business days (subject to any required delay in payment required by
Section 409A of the Code) of the earlier termination of holder’s employment without cause or due to the holder’s
death, total disability or RSU Qualified Retirement, in each case, prior to the applicable vesting date. The table below
sets forth the number of shares of Company common stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, subject to RSUs
held by each of the Company’s executive officers and the applicable vesting date of each such RSU:

Performance Shares. Each outstanding PSU, other than the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units
credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an
amount equal to the merger consideration (assuming maximum level performance was achieved for purposes of
determining the number of PSUs) and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in cash to the
holder of such PSU at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the
applicable performance period if the holder continues employment through the end of such performance period in
accordance with the original payment terms of the award, without any ongoing performance-vesting conditions. In

Mr. Hicks’s PSUs became fully vested on December 31, 2021 and are scheduled to be settled in July 2022.

This table does not include Mr. Brandon’s Match Award, which is described below.
Match Award. The PSUs granted to Mr. Brandon under the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units
credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an
amount in cash equal to the merger consideration less any required withholding taxes, payable to Mr. Brandon at the
time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr.
Brandon continues employment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment
terms of the award. However, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will
not be assumed for purposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award. Instead, the amount
payable to Mr. Brandon in respect of the Match Award will be determined based on the actual attainment of the
“adjusted book value per common share” performance goal during the Match Award’s five-year performance period
ending December 31, 2026 and the actual number of
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
PSUs earned during the performance period. The merger agreement provides for full accelerated vesting of the right
to receive the amount payable in respect of the Match Award upon the earlier termination of Mr. Brandon’s
employment without cause or due to his death, total disability or PSU Qualified Retirement, consistent with the PSUs
held by other employees. The number of shares subject to the PSUs under Mr. Brandon’s Match Award are 11,457
assuming target level performance and 22,914 assuming maximum level performance.
In addition, similar “at risk” treatment may apply to other PSUs held by Mr. Brandon to the extent necessary to
eliminate or reduce exposure to Mr. Brandon under Section 280G of the Code, as agreed to by the Company, which
could result in a reduced payout to Mr. Brandon in respect of his other PSUs depending on the actual attainment of
the performance goals during the applicable performance period.
Director Awards. Each outstanding Director RSU, including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto,
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation the merger consideration in
cash at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement or applicable deferral election. In addition, the
equity awards made to our non-employee directors on the business day following our 2021 annual meeting of
stockholders pursuant to the Company’s 2015 Directors’ Stock Plan will vest as of April 30, 2022.
Each RSU (except for any RSU that vests prior to the effective time of the merger), PSU and Director RSU will be
credited with interest at the prime rate from the effective time of the merger until the respective payment date.
Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company’s Officers and Highly Compensated Employees Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan (the “DCP”) provides for unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements for the
benefit of officers and highly compensated employees of the Company and certain subsidiaries. Under the DCP, the
Company may make contributions to a participant’s plan account and participants may elect to defer all or a portion
of their base salary or non-equity incentive compensation under the plan. A participant may elect to have amounts
under the plan either credited with interest at the prime rate (“notional prime rate election”), treated as though
invested in the Company’s common stock (“common stock election”), or increased or decreased by an amount
proportionate to the growth or decline in the Company’s stockholders’ equity per share (“stockholders equity
election”). The merger agreement provides that any amounts for which a “common stock election” or a “stockholders
equity election” is in effect under the DCP will be deemed reinvested into the “notional prime rate election”
alternative thereunder. After the closing of the merger, no further “common stock elections” or “stockholders equity
elections” will be permitted under the DCP.
Quantification of Payments. For an estimate of the amounts that would be realized by the Company’s named
executive officers in respect of their equity awards in connection with the merger, see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers” below.
We estimate that the aggregate amount that would be realized by the Company’s eight non-employee directors in
respect of their equity-based awards is $15,985,805.
CEO Employment Agreement
Mr. Brandon’s employment agreement provides that, in the event of a termination of his employment by the Company
without cause (other than due to death or total disability), subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of
the Company and its affiliates, he will be entitled to continued payment of his base salary until such payments
aggregate $1,050,000 on a gross basis, as severance. Such severance payments shall be conditioned on Mr.
Brandon’s compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including a confidentiality provision, an invention
assignment provision and one-year post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. Mr. Brandon’s
severance payments would be payable over time following a qualifying termination of employment without regard to
the consummation of the merger and are not enhanced by reason of the merger or a termination of employment
following the merger.
For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Mr.
Brandon, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the
Company’s Named Executive Officers” below.
Match Award
Pursuant to Mr. Brandon’s employment agreement, he is entitled to receive a matching PSU award covering the first
$7.5 million worth of shares of Company common stock (assuming target level performance) that he purchased during
the period between October 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022 and shares of Company common
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
stock that he notionally invested into his account under the DCP as of April 1, 2022. Between October 1, 2021 and
March 4, 2022, Mr. Brandon purchased 9,085 shares of Company common stock on the open market and, pursuant to
the terms of the DCP and his Match Award agreement, his account under the DCP was notionally invested on March
1, 2022 into another 2,386.9279 shares of Company common stock, which shares became subject to the Match Award
agreement.
The award agreement for Mr. Brandon’s Match Award provides that PSUs will be earned based on the Company’s
“Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share” (as defined in the award agreement) achievement during the five year
period commencing January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2026. 200% of the target PSUs will be earned for
Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share achievement of 10% or more, 100% will be earned for Adjusted Book Value
Per Common Share achievement of 7%, 50% will be earned for Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share achievement
of 4% and 0% will be earned for Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share achievement of less than 4%, with straight-
line interpolation used to calculate the earned amount if achievement is between the percentages above.
Pursuant to the Match Award agreement, to earn the PSUs under the Match Award, Mr. Brandon would be required
to remain in continued employment with the Company through the end of the performance period, except that, if his
employment terminates on or after December 31, 2024 (i) by the Company without “Cause” (as defined in Mr.
Brandon’s employment agreement), or (ii) due to his death, total disability or retirement (which is defined in Mr.
Brandon’s Match Award agreement as his retirement from the Company that occurs after he has attained age 65 and
has completed 12 years of service, provided that he has not engaged in conduct that constitutes “Cause” prior to his
retirement), Mr. Brandon would be entitled to pro-rata vesting of his matching PSUs based on the Company’s
“Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share” achievement during the performance period as of the December 31st
immediately preceding his termination date or, if his employment terminates on December 31st, as of such date.
Under the merger agreement, each outstanding PSU under the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units
credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an
amount equal to the merger consideration, less any required withholding taxes, payable in cash to Mr. Brandon at the
time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr.
Brandon continues employment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment
terms of the award. However, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will
not be assumed for purposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award. Instead, the amount
payable to Mr. Brandon in respect of the Match Award will be determined based on the actual attainment of the
“adjusted book value per common share” performance goal during the Match Award’s five-year performance period
ending December 31, 2026. The merger agreement provides for full accelerated vesting of the right to receive the
amount payable in respect of the Match Award upon the earlier termination of Mr. Brandon’s employment without
cause or due to his death, total disability or PSU Qualified Retirement, consistent with the PSUs held by other
employees.
Mr. Brandon’s award agreement also provides that he must maintain unencumbered beneficial ownership of the
purchased shares and notional shares credited under the DCP on which matching PSUs were granted and shares of
the Company’s common stock he owned as of the date of grant of the Match Award, which covered a total of
34,325.9279 shares of Company common stock (collectively, the “Vested Securities”), throughout the five-year
performance period in order to receive the full amount of matching PSUs. However, pursuant to the merger agreement,
shares of common stock owned by Mr. Brandon that are treated as Vested Securities will be converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash based on the per share merger consideration, and notional shares of common stock
credited to Mr. Brandon under the DCP that are treated as Vested Securities will be deemed to be reinvested into the
“notional prime rate election” alternative under the DCP. As a result, after the merger, Mr. Brandon will no longer hold
any Vested Securities and, consequently, the foregoing restriction on transferring Vested Securities will cease to
apply.
Interim Period Director Cash Compensation
In connection with the merger agreement, commencing effective May 1, 2022, the non-employee directors will be paid
a fixed monthly cash retainer for their continued service on the Board until the closing of the merger consisting of: (i)
$12,500 per month, which is being paid in lieu of the grant of an annual equity award in respect of 2022; (ii) $8,333.33
(or, for Mr. Kirby, $17,500) per month, which is being paid in lieu of the annual
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cash retainer for Board service that non-employee directors are otherwise entitled to receive; and (iii) the amount of
annual cash payments that non-employee directors are otherwise entitled to receive for committee service, paid pro
rata on a monthly basis until the closing of the merger.
The non-employee directors were granted annual equity awards on the business day following the 2021 annual
meeting of stockholders, which are scheduled to vest at the next annual meeting of stockholders, which was expected
to occur in April 2022. The 2022 annual meeting of stockholders is not expected to be held in April 2022. As a result,
in connection with the merger agreement, the Company agreed to cause the 2021 annual equity awards granted to the
Company’s non-employee directors to vest on April 30, 2022.
Post-Closing Severance
In accordance with the disclosure letter to the merger agreement, Berkshire will cause the surviving corporation to
provide severance to any employee, including any executive officer, who is terminated without cause by Berkshire or
its subsidiaries within one year following the effective time of the merger, equal to one year’s salary and target annual
bonus (or, for John F. Shannon, the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, his maximum
annual bonus), plus full COBRA premium subsidy for such period, subject to such employee’s execution of an
effective general release of claims in favor of the surviving corporation and its affiliates (the “Post-Closing Severance
Program”).
For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to each
of the Company’s named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Quantification of
Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers” below.
Section 280G Tax Gross Up Payments and Mitigation
If any payment or benefit to Kerry J. Jacobs, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, or
Mr. Shannon results in the payment of a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (as
defined below), Berkshire and the Company have agreed that the surviving corporation will provide a tax gross up
(including with respect to any such gross up payments) to such executive officer for any excise taxes imposed under
Section 280G of the Code in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including by
reason of a termination of employment in connection therewith (and the severance payable in respect thereto). No
other named executive officers are entitled to a Section 280G tax gross up.
If and to the extent necessary or appropriate to mitigate or eliminate the imposition of excise taxes under Section 280G
on Mr. Brandon, the Company may agree to make PSU awards held by Mr. Brandon subject to similar “at-risk”
treatment as the Match Award, whereby the amount of the cash payment for the PSU award will be based on the
actual attainment of the “adjusted book value per common share” performance goal during the applicable
performance period.
For an estimate of the value of the tax gross-up payments described above that would be payable to Ms. Jacobs or
Mr. Shannon, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the
Company’s Named Executive Officers” below.
Indemnification
Under the merger agreement, from and after the effective time of the merger, Berkshire has agreed that it will, and will
cause the surviving corporation to, subject to certain limitations, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement or who becomes such prior to the
effective time of the merger, an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (“indemnified parties”),
against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or judgments or amounts incurred by
such person in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and (ii) all of such liabilities based in whole or in part on, or pertaining to, the merger agreement or the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
From the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation will
contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation set forth in the certificate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws of the Company, which provisions will not be amended,
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
modified or otherwise repealed for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger in any manner that would
diminish or adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified party as of the effective time, unless such
modification is required after the effective time by law and then only to the minimum extent required by such law.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers
The information in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires
disclosure of information about certain compensation for each of the Company’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise related to the merger, and assumes, among other things, that each named executive officer will
experience a qualifying termination immediately following the consummation of the merger. Please note that the
amounts described and quantified below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the
effective time of the merger. For purposes of calculating the amounts included in the table below, we have assumed
December 31, 2022 as the closing date of the merger and a termination of each named executive officer’s employment
by Berkshire or its subsidiaries without cause immediately following the effective time of the merger.

Represents cash payments under the Post-Closing Severance Program upon a termination without cause by Berkshire or its
subsidiaries within one year following the effective time of the merger, including (i) a cash severance payment in an amount equal
to the sum of the named executive officer’s annual base salary ($1,050,000 for Mr. Brandon, $715,000 for Ms. Jacobs, $800,000
for Mr. Dalrymple and $500,000 for Mr. Shannon) plus the named executive officer’s target annual incentive bonus or, for Mr.
Shannon, his maximum annual bonus ($2,100,000 for Mr. Brandon, $950,950 for Ms. Jacobs, $800,000 for Mr. Dalrymple and
$600,000 for Mr. Shannon), plus (ii) a full COBRA premium cash subsidy for the one-year period following the effective time of
the merger (equal to $57,333 for Messrs. Brandon, Dalrymple and Shannon and $34,199 for Ms. Jacobs). All such payments are
“double-trigger” (i.e., payable upon a qualifying termination following the effective time of the merger). Receipt of these
payments is subject to the employee’s execution of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates.
Mr. Brandon will receive the enhanced severance described above only if his employment termination occurs within one year
following the effective time of the merger. If Mr. Brandon’s employment is terminated by the Company without “cause” (other
than due to death or total disability) prior to the effective time of the merger, he would instead be entitled to cash severance of
$1,050,000 pursuant to his employment agreement, subject to (i) his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company
and its affiliates and (ii) his compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including a confidentiality provision, an invention
assignment provision and one-year post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. Mr. Brandon’s cash
severance pursuant to his employment agreement would be payable over time following such termination and would not be
enhanced by reason of the merger if the effective time of the merger occurs after his termination date. For purposes of
calculating the amounts included in the table above, we have assumed that Mr. Brandon’s employment will be terminated by the
Company without cause immediately following the effective time of the merger, and so we have included Mr. Brandon’s enhanced
severance under the Post-Closing Severance Program in the table.

based on the merger consideration; and (ii) the value of unvested PSUs based on the merger consideration (assuming maximum
level performance is achieved for purposes of determining the number of PSUs); in each case that would become fully vested

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",45,51
ALLEGHANY CORP DE_20220429_DEFM14A_20052995_4452227.Pdf,Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S.
holders of Company common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is
based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, judicial opinions and administrative
rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, each as in effect as of the date hereof. These
authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the accuracy of
the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences
arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, nor does it address any tax considerations
under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This
discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge,
which could be sustained. No ruling is intended to be sought from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the
merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Company common stock that is:
•
a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s
administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a
U.S. person; or
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Company common stock, other than a
partnership or other entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is not a U.S. holder.
This discussion applies only to holders of shares of Company common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion
does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of its
particular circumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal
income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign
investment companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-
to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional
currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, banks and certain other financial institutions, mutual
funds, certain expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in partnerships or
such other entities, holders who hold shares of Company common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive
sale or conversion transaction, holders who will hold, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in the surviving
corporation, holders who acquired their shares of Company common stock through the exercise of employee stock
options or other compensation arrangements and holders who own or have owned (directly, indirectly or
constructively) five percent (5%) or more of the Company’s common stock (by vote or value)).
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) holds shares of Company common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will
generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a
partnership holding shares of Company common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.
Holders of Company common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any
state, local, foreign or other tax laws.
43TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consequences to U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger will be
a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.
If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Company common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than
one year as of the date of the merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of
certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential
rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired
different blocks of Company common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its
adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Company common stock.
Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
A non-U.S. holder whose shares of Company common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless:
•
gain resulting from the merger is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or
business (and, if required by any applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment of the non-U.S. holder); or
•
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
individual’s taxable year in which the merger occurs and certain other conditions are satisfied.
Any gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net income basis at regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such
holder were a “U.S. person” as defined under the Code. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject
to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income
tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax
profits are not reinvested and maintained in the U.S. business.
Gain described in the second bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate, but
may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses, if any, of the non-U.S. holder.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under
certain circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup
withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number
provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. In general, a non-U.S. holder will not
be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding and information reporting with respect to cash payments to the non-
U.S. holder pursuant to the merger if the non-U.S. holder has provided an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or
an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI if the non-U.S. holder’s gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a
U.S. trade or business).
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the
required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.
This summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is
not tax advice. Holders of common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to
them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and the effect of any
federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals",51,53
ALLEGHANY CORP DE_20220429_DEFM14A_20052995_4452227.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals,"Regulatory Approvals
Antitrust Approval in the U.S.
Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until
notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory
waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On April 6, 2022, both the Company and Berkshire filed their
respective Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. As a result,
assuming the Notification and Report Forms are deemed complete, the required waiting period will expire at 11:59 p.m.
on May 6, 2022, unless extended by a request for additional information.
At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, or before or after the
effective time of the merger, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally approve the merger upon the
divestiture of assets of the Company or Berkshire or subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition,
U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the
public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion
subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
some circumstances. Although neither the Company nor Berkshire believes that the merger will violate federal
antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if
such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.
Non-U.S. Antitrust Approvals
The merger is also likely reportable and subject to the approval of antitrust and competition regulators in the
following non-U.S. jurisdictions: Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan and South Africa. In addition,
foreign filings might be required in a few other non-U.S. jurisdictions which have yet to be determined by the parties.
U.S. Insurance Regulatory Approvals
The insurance laws and regulations of all fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia generally require that before
the acquisition of control of an insurance company may occur, either through the acquisition of or merger with the
insurance company or a holding company of that insurance company, the acquiring party must obtain approval from
the insurance regulator of the insurance company’s state of domicile. In addition, under the laws of certain states, an
acquirer must obtain the approval of the state’s insurance regulator to acquire control of an insurance company that
is commercially domiciled in that state. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is
presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies
representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. Because a person acquiring 10% or more of
our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our insurance subsidiaries, the
insurance change of control laws would apply to the acquisition of Company common stock by Berkshire pursuant to
the merger agreement.
Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner
will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant’s
board of directors and executive officers, the acquirer’s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and
any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Berkshire has filed
applications with the insurance departments of the States of Delaware, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York and
Wisconsin with respect to the acquisition of control of the Company’s Delaware, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
York and Wisconsin domiciled insurance or reinsurance company subsidiaries. Berkshire will also be filing a notice
with the insurance department of the State of Vermont with respect to the acquisition of control of the Company’s
Vermont-domiciled insurance captive subsidiary.
Further, several U.S. state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance regulatory authorities of an
acquisition of control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state if the acquisition would
result in specified levels of market concentration. While these prior notification statutes do not authorize the state
insurance regulatory authorities to disapprove the acquisition of control, they authorize regulatory action in the
affected state, including requiring the insurance company to cease and desist from doing certain types of business in
the affected state or denying an application for a license to do business in the affected state, if particular conditions
exist, such as the substantial lessening of competition in any line of business in such state.
45TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition to the foregoing, Berkshire will file an application for prior non-disapproval of the change of control with
the insurance department of the State of Texas with respect to the Company’s subsidiary that is licensed as an agent
in the State of Texas.
Non-U.S. Insurance Regulatory Approval
Applications for approval or notifications to regulators have been, or will be, filed with certain non-U.S. regulatory
authorities, including but not limited to: (i) the Prudential Regulation Authority and Lloyd’s of London in the United
Kingdom; (ii) the Commissariat Aux Assurances in Luxembourg; (iii) the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission in
Gibraltar; (iv) the Banco Central del Paraguay in Paraguay; (v) the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in
Australia; (vi) the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (and other provincial regulators) in Canada;
(vii) the Bermuda Monetary Authority in Bermuda; and (viii) the Financial Services Authority in Japan.
Timing
Although Berkshire and the Company do not expect the relevant insurance regulatory authorities to raise any
significant concerns in connection with their review of the merger, there is no assurance that Berkshire or the
Company, as applicable, will obtain all required insurance regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, or that these
approvals will not include a restriction, limitation or condition which, in such case, would permit Berkshire to refuse
to close the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and consummate the merger.
Other
Other than the approvals and notifications described above, neither the Company nor Berkshire is aware of any
material insurance regulatory approvals required to be obtained, or waiting periods required to expire, after the
making of a filing. If the Company or Berkshire discover that other approvals or filings and waiting periods are
necessary, they will seek to obtain or comply with them, although, as is the case with the regulatory approvals
described above, there can be no assurance that they will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. Berkshire and the
Company are each required to use their respective reasonable best efforts to file all the necessary documentation and
obtain all consents of third parties that are necessary to consummate the acquisition and to comply with the terms
and conditions of all consents, approvals and authorizations of any third party or governmental entity.

As of April 28, 2022, three complaints have been filed in the federal courts of New York by purported Alleghany
stockholders against Alleghany and the Board in connection with the merger (Stein v. Alleghany Corporation, et al.,
22-cv-3057 (SDNY), O’Dell v. Alleghany Corporation, et al., 22-cv-3331 (SDNY) and Justice v. Alleghany
Corporation, et al., 22-cv-02393 (EDNY)). Each of the complaints asserts claims for violations of Sections 14(a) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act, alleging that certain disclosures regarding the merger in the preliminary proxy statement
are untrue statements of material facts and omit certain material facts related to the transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement. We believe that the claims asserted in these complaints are meritless. No assurance can be made
as to the outcome of such lawsuits, including the amount of costs associated with defending, settling, or any other
liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of, such claims.

Under the merger agreement, equity-based awards outstanding as of the effective time of the merger will be treated at
the effective time of the merger as follows:
Restricted Stock Units. Each outstanding RSU, other than any Director RSU, including any dividend equivalent units
credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an
amount equal to the merger consideration and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in cash
to the holder of such RSU within 15 business days of the existing vesting date applicable to such RSU if the holder
continues employment through the vesting date, subject to full accelerated vesting and payment within 15 business
days (subject to any required delay in payment required under Section 409A of the Code) of the earlier termination of
the holder’s employment without cause or due to the holder’s death, total disability or RSU Qualified Retirement. The
amount payable in respect of each RSU will be credited with interest at the prime rate until the respective payment
date. For any outstanding RSU that vests prior to the effective time of the merger, the RSU consideration will be paid
without interest within 15 business days of the closing of the merger.
Performance Shares. Each outstanding PSU, other than the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units
credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an
amount equal to the merger consideration (assuming maximum level performance was achieved for purposes of
determining the number of PSUs) and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in cash to the
holder of such PSU at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the
applicable performance period if the holder continues employment through the end of such performance period in
accordance with the original payment terms of the award, without any ongoing performance-vesting conditions,
subject to full accelerated vesting upon the earlier termination of the holder’s employment without cause or due to
holder’s death, total disability or PSU Qualified Retirement. Each PSU will be credited with interest at the prime rate
until the respective payment date.
Match Award. The PSUs granted under the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect
thereto, will also be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an
48TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount equal to the merger consideration, less any required withholding taxes, payable in cash to Mr. Brandon at the
time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr.
Brandon continues employment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment
terms of the award. However, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will
not be assumed for purposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award. Instead, the amount
payable to Mr. Brandon in respect of the Match Award will be determined based on the actual attainment of the
“adjusted book value per common share” performance goal during the Match Award’s five-year performance period
ending December 31, 2026 and the actual number of PSUs earned during the performance period, subject to full
acceleration upon the earlier termination of Mr. Brandon’s employment without cause or due to his death, total
disability or PSU Qualified Retirement, consistent with the PSUs held by other employees.
In addition, similar “at risk” treatment may apply to other PSUs held by Mr. Brandon to the extent necessary to
eliminate or reduce exposure to Mr. Brandon under Section 280G of the Code, as agreed to by the Company.
Director Awards. Each Director RSU, including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto, will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount equal to the merger
consideration in cash at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement or applicable deferral election.
Each Director RSU will be credited with interest at the prime rate until the respective payment date. In addition, the
equity awards made to our non-employee directors on the business day following our 2021 annual meeting of
stockholders pursuant to the Company’s 2015 Directors’ Stock Plan will vest as of April 30, 2022.
Deferred Compensation Plan. The merger agreement provides that any amounts for which a “common stock
election” or a “stockholders equity election” is in effect under the DCP will be reinvested into the “notional prime rate
election” alternative thereunder. After the closing of the merger, no further “common stock elections” or
“stockholders equity elections” will be permitted under the DCP.

Before the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying agent to receive the funds necessary to make payments under the merger agreement.
When and as needed, Berkshire or Merger Sub will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, in trust with the paying
agent in a separate account for the benefit of the holders of the Company common stock funds required for the
aggregate merger consideration.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger (but no later than three business days
following the effective time), Berkshire will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of certificates or
book-entry shares whose shares of Company common stock were converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration, a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to surrender certificates representing such Company
common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of certificates or book-entry shares may
thereafter until the first anniversary of the effective time of the merger surrender such certificates or book-entry
shares to the paying agent. Upon delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and the surrender of certificates or book-entry shares on or before the
first anniversary of the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will cause the paying agent to pay the holder of such
certificates or book-entry shares, in exchange therefor, cash in an amount equal to the merger consideration multiplied
by the number of shares of Company common stock represented by such certificate or book-entry share. The merger
consideration paid upon the surrender of certificates and book-entry shares in accordance with the merger agreement
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of the Company common stock
previously represented by such certificates and book-entry shares.
49TABLE OF CONTENTS
If payment of the merger consideration in respect of cancelled shares of Company common stock is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name surrendered certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such
payment that:
•
the certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer; and
•
the person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such
payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the certificates surrendered or will have
established to the satisfaction of the paying agent that such tax is not applicable.
At the effective time of the merger, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there will not be any
further registration of transfers of any shares of Company common stock thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the effective time of the merger, the holders of certificates and book-entry shares will cease to have
any rights with respect to any such certificates and book-entry shares, except as otherwise provided for in the merger
agreement or by applicable law. Each certificate or book-entry share representing Company common stock that is
surrendered will be cancelled. You should not send in your Company common stock certificates until you receive a
letter of transmittal with instructions from the paying agent. Do not send Company common stock certificates with
your proxy card.

or (ii) in respect of a person that submits a takeover proposal prior to the no-shop period start date and such takeover
proposal is determined by the Board in good faith to be or reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal (an
“excluded party”), 10 calendar days after the no-shop period start date (the “cut-off date”), the Company, its
subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors or employees or any affiliate, investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative (collectively, “representatives”) had the right to:
•
solicit, initiate, induce or encourage any takeover proposals, or facilitate the making, submission or
announcement of one or more takeover proposals from any person or its representatives, including by
furnishing to any person or its representatives any non-public information relating to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or by affording to any person or its representatives access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each
case, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement;
•
enter into, participate in or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person or its representatives
with respect to a takeover proposal or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a takeover
proposal; and
•
otherwise cooperate with, assist, participate in or facilitate any takeover proposal or any proposal that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a takeover proposal.
The Company has agreed under the merger agreement, subject to certain exceptions described below, from and after
the no-shop period start date (or with respect to an excluded party, the cut-off date), to cease any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may then be ongoing with respect to a takeover proposal and to:
•
seek to have returned to the Company or destroyed any confidential information that has been provided in
any such discussions or negotiations;
•
cease providing any further information with respect to the Company or any takeover proposal to any such

of its or their representatives to:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover
proposal; or
•

54TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the event the Company receives a “superior proposal” or a proposal which is reasonably expected to lead to a
superior proposal that was made prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger
and in circumstances not involving a breach of the merger agreement, the Board determines in good faith, after
considering applicable provisions of state law and after consultation with outside counsel, that a failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may in response to such takeover
proposal:
•
request information from the person making the takeover proposal for the sole purpose of the Board
informing itself about the takeover proposal;
•
furnish information with respect to the Company to the person making the takeover proposal pursuant to
an acceptable confidentiality agreement (provided that (i) such confidentiality agreement may not include
any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (ii) the Company advises
Berkshire of all such nonpublic information delivered to such person concurrently with its delivery to the
requesting party); and
•
participate in negotiations with such party regarding such takeover proposal.
From the no-shop period start date (or with respect to an excluded party, the cut-off date), under the merger
agreement, the Company has agreed not to waive or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it is a party relating to a potential or actual takeover proposal (unless the Board determines in
good faith, after considering applicable provisions of applicable law and after consultation with outside counsel, that
enforcing or not waiving such provision would otherwise prevent a takeover proposal from being made to the
Company).
In addition, except as described below, neither the Board nor any committee thereof may:
•
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Berkshire, the approval, determination of advisability or
recommendation by the Board of the merger agreement and the merger;
•
approve, determine advisable or recommend any takeover proposal; or
•
cause the Company to enter into any agreement related to any takeover proposal (other than an acceptable
confidentiality agreement).
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of the
merger agreement and the merger, in the event the Board determines in good faith, in response to a superior proposal
made in circumstances not involving a breach of the merger agreement, after considering applicable provisions of
applicable law and after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Board may:
•
withdraw or modify its approval, determination of advisability or recommendation of the merger agreement
and merger;
•
approve, determine to be advisable or recommend a superior proposal; or
•
cause the Company to enter into an acquisition agreement.
Such actions may only be taken if, (i) after providing Berkshire two business days’ prior written notice that the Board
has received a superior proposal and specifying the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal,
identifying the person making the superior proposal and providing notice of the action the Board has determined to
take; (ii) if the Company has negotiated in good faith with Berkshire during such two business days’ notice period, to
the extent Berkshire requests to negotiate, to enable Berkshire to propose revisions to the terms of the merger
agreement; (iii) the Board considered in good faith any written revisions to the terms of the merger agreement
proposed by Berkshire, and determined in good faith (after consultation with financial advisors and receiving the
advice of outside counsel) that the superior proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior proposal
if the revisions proposed by Berkshire were to be given effect; and (iv) in the event of any change to any of the
financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of
such superior proposal, the Company has delivered to Berkshire an additional two business days’ notice and a new
notice period during which time the Company will be required to comply with these requirements anew.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the merger agreement the Company has agreed to promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise
Berkshire orally and in writing of any request for confidential information in connection with a takeover proposal or
of any takeover proposal, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of such person making such
request or takeover proposal and to keep Berkshire promptly advised of all significant developments which could
lead the Board to withdrawing or modifying its recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger.
In addition, and notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, the Board may at any time, in
response to any material event or development or material change in circumstances with respect to the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that (i) was neither known by nor reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of or prior
to the date of the merger agreement and (ii) that does relate to (A) any takeover proposal or (B) clearance of the
merger or satisfaction of any waiting period under any antitrust laws (an “intervening event”), withdraw or modify its
approval, determination of advisability or recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger in the event it
determines in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of state law and after consultation with outside
counsel, that any such withdrawal or modification of its approval, determination of advisability or recommendation is
required in order for the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company has agreed to
provide Berkshire five business days’ prior written notice that the Board intends to take such action and specifying,
in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and specifying the intervening event in reasonable detail.
Under the merger agreement, “takeover proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group of
persons (other than Berkshire and its subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives) relating to (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of (A) 20% or more of the
consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (B) equity securities of the Company which together with any other equity securities of the Company beneficially
owned by such person or group of persons would equal 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group of
persons beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company; or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving (A) the Company or (B) subsidiaries of the Company representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.
Under the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means a bona fide written takeover proposal (with all references to
“20%” in the definition of takeover proposal being deemed to be references to “100%”) that was not the result of a
violation of the non-solicitation provisions and which the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
financial advisors and receiving the advice of outside counsel) (i) is in the best interests of the Company; (ii) is more
favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the merger; (iii) is no less favorable to
the stockholders of the Company with respect to the certainty and timing of closing and payment than the merger;
and (iv) for which the third party has demonstrated that the financing for such offer, if any, is fully committed.

(PROPOSAL 2)","ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL 2)
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, the Company is
required to submit a proposal to the Company’s stockholders for an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the
payment by the Company of certain compensation to the named executive officers of the Company that is based on
or otherwise related to the merger. This proposal is commonly known as “say-on-golden parachutes,” and we refer to
it as the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal. This compensation is summarized in the
Golden Parachute Compensation table under “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger,” including the footnotes to that table and the related narrative discussion.
The Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information
disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Board unanimously recommends that the Company’s stockholders approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Company hereby approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company that is based on
or otherwise related to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Golden Parachute
Compensation table, the footnotes to that table and the related narrative discussion.”
The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the
vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. Accordingly, you may vote to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-
related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Berkshire. Accordingly, if the
merger agreement and merger are approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation will be
payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding)
vote of the Company’s stockholders.
The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of the Company’s named executive officers on an
advisory basis will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast, in person or represented
by proxy, at the special meeting at which a quorum is present.
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related compensation
proposal.

The Company’s stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the Company authority to adjourn
the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. If this adjournment proposal is approved,
the special meeting could be adjourned by the Board to any date. In addition, regardless of whether a quorum is
present, the chairperson of the special meeting has the power under the Company’s bylaws to adjourn the special
meeting from time to time. Furthermore, the Board could postpone the special meeting before it commences, whether
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other reasons. If the special meeting is adjourned for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke
them at any time prior to their use. If you sign, date and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on
any proposal, or if you sign, date and return a proxy and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal
to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment
proposal, your shares of common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. The Company does not
intend to call a vote on this proposal if Proposal 1 has been approved at the special meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS",73,75
ALLEGHANY CORP DE_20220429_DEFM14A_20052995_4452227.Pdf,APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Under Delaware law, holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to dissenters’ rights of appraisal in
connection with the merger, provided that such holders meet all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL
(“Section 262”). Pursuant to Section 262, stockholders of the Company who do not vote in favor of the merger and
who comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of
their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Court”) if the merger is completed. It is possible
that the fair value as determined by the Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger consideration.
Stockholders should note that investment banking opinions as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, are not opinions as to, and do not in any manner
address, fair value under the DGCL. Stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the strict
procedures set forth in Section 262 in order to demand and perfect their rights. Any stockholder of the Company
wishing to preserve its rights to appraisal must make a demand for appraisal as described below.
The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Section 262 required to be followed by
dissenting Company stockholders wishing to demand and perfect their appraisal rights. This summary, however, is
not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 262, the full text of which appears in Annex C to this proxy statement.
Under Section 262, the Company is required to notify stockholders not less than 20 days before the special meeting
to vote on the merger that appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 must be included with that notice.
The special meeting will be held on June 9, 2022.
This proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to its stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in
connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 set forth
in Annex C to this proxy statement and consult your legal advisor. If you fail to timely and properly comply with the
requirements of Section 262, your appraisal rights may be lost. To exercise appraisal rights with respect to your
shares of Company common stock, you must:
•
NOT vote your shares of Company common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the merger;
•
deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the date of the special
meeting, as described further below under “-Written Demand and Notice;”
•
continuously hold your shares of Company common stock through the date the merger is consummated;
and
•
otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262.
If you sign, date and return a proxy card, or submit a proxy by telephone or through the internet, that does not
contain voting instructions, you will effectively waive your appraisal rights because such shares represented by the
proxy, unless the proxy is revoked, will be voted for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
merger. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a
proxy containing instructions to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger or
abstain from voting on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.
Only a holder of record of shares of Company common stock, or a person duly authorized and explicitly purporting to
act on that stockholder’s behalf, is entitled to assert appraisal rights for the shares of Company common stock
registered in that stockholder’s name. A demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the Company
of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s Company common stock. A proxy or vote against the merger shall not constitute such a demand.
Beneficial owners who do not also hold the shares of record may not directly make appraisal demands to the
Company. The beneficial owner must, in such cases, have the registered stockholder submit the required demand in
respect of those shares.
If the shares of Company common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares of Company common stock are
owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the
67TABLE OF CONTENTS
demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more
joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify
the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent
for such owner or owners. Stockholders who hold their shares of Company common stock in brokerage accounts or
other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine
the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.
Failure to strictly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss, termination or waiver of
appraisal rights. Stockholders who vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the
merger will not have a right to have the fair market value of their shares of Company common stock determined.
However, failure to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger is not
sufficient to perfect appraisal rights. If you desire to exercise your appraisal rights, you must also submit to the
Company a written demand for payment of the fair value of the Company common stock held by you. In order to
assist stockholders in determining whether to exercise appraisal rights, copies of the Company’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 are incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement.
Written Demand and Notice
A written demand for appraisal should be filed with the Company before the special meeting. The demand notice shall
be sufficient if it reasonably informs the Company of your identity and that you wish to seek appraisal with respect to
your shares of Company common stock. All demands should be delivered to: Alleghany Corporation, 1411 Broadway,
34th Floor, New York, New York 10018, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
The surviving corporation, within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, will notify each stockholder who has
complied with Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the merger of the effective date of the merger.
Judicial Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation or any stockholder who is entitled to
appraisal rights and has otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition with the Court demanding a determination of the value of the Company common stock held by all such
stockholders. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and
holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the
holders of Company common stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights within the time
prescribed in Section 262. If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is
delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving
service of a copy of the petition, to file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly
verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares of
Company common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Company common stock have
not been reached by the surviving corporation. After notice to the surviving corporation and dissenting
stockholders who demanded payment of their shares of Company common stock, the Court is empowered to conduct
a hearing upon the petition, and to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL
and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided thereby. The Court may require the stockholders who
have demanded appraisal for their shares of Company common stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register
in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to
comply with that direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.
After the Court determines the holders of Company common stock entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding
shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through this proceeding, the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid, if any,
upon the amount determined to be “fair value” in an appraisal proceeding. In determining the fair value of the shares
the Court will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court
discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that
“proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “fair price obviously
requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated
that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that
throw any light on future prospects of the corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc.,
the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and
not the product of speculation, may be considered.” Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established
from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment.
Stockholders who consider seeking appraisal should consider that the fair value of their shares under Section 262
could be more than, the same as, or less than, the value of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement
without the exercise of appraisal rights. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Court. Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual
circumstances, may or may not be a dissenter’s exclusive remedy. The Court may determine the cost of the appraisal
proceeding and assess it against the parties as the Court deems equitable. Upon application of a dissenting
stockholder, the Court may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and
expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Company common stock entitled to
appraisal. In the absence of a court determination or assessment, each party will bear its own expenses.
Any stockholder who has demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective time, be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or receive payment of dividends or other distributions, if any, on the
Company common stock, except for dividends or distributions, if any, payable to stockholders of record at a date
before the merger.
Request for Appraisal Data
If you submit a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Company common stock and otherwise properly
perfect your appraisal rights, you may, upon written request mailed to the surviving corporation within 120 days after
the effective date of the merger, receive a written statement identifying (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Company common stock that were not voted in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the
merger and with respect to which the Company has received written demands for appraisal; and (ii) the aggregate
number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation will mail this statement to you within 10 days after
receiving your written request. If no petition is filed by either the surviving corporation or any dissenting stockholder
within the 120-day period after the effective date of the merger, the rights of all dissenting stockholders to appraisal
will cease. Stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving corporation will file
a petition with respect to the appraisal of the fair value of their shares or that the surviving corporation will initiate
any negotiations with respect to the fair value of those shares. The surviving corporation will be under no obligation
to take any action in this regard and the Company and Berkshire have no present intention to do so. Accordingly, it
is the obligation of stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company common stock to initiate all
necessary action with respect to the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262. Failure to file the petition on a timely basis will cause the stockholder’s right to an appraisal
to cease.
Withdrawal
Even if you submit a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Company common stock and otherwise properly
perfect your appraisal rights, you may withdraw your demand at any time after the effective date of the merger, except
that any such attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require the
written approval of the surviving corporation and, once a petition for appraisal is filed, the
69
TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any holder absent court approval. The foregoing, however, will not
affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered under the merger
agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. If you withdraw your demand, you will be deemed to
have accepted the terms of the merger agreement, which terms are summarized in this proxy statement and which
agreement is attached in its entirety as Annex A to this proxy statement.
The foregoing summary is not intended to be a complete statement of the procedures for exercising appraisal rights
under Section 262 and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262, a copy of which is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. The Company urges any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal
rights, if any, to read this summary and Section 262 carefully, and to consult legal counsel before attempting to
exercise appraisal rights. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the
loss of your statutory appraisal rights.

If the merger is consummated, the Company does not currently expect to hold an annual meeting of stockholders in
2022. If the merger is not consummated, you will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in the Company’s
annual meetings of stockholders, and the Company would expect in such circumstance to hold a 2022 annual meeting
of stockholders, in which case the Company would provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on
which such 2022 annual meeting will be held. If the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders is held, stockholder

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (“Parent”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
“Shares”), of Alleghany Corporation (the “Company”) of the $848.02 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 20, 2022 (the “Agreement”), by and among Parent,
Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities
they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time
purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective
affiliates and third parties, including affiliates of Warren Buffett, a significant shareholder of Parent (the “Significant
Shareholder”) or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the Agreement
(the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with
the Transaction, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to
indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment
Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a book runner with respect
to a public offering of the Company’s 3.25% senior unsecured notes due August 2051 (aggregate principal amount
$500,000,000) in July 2021; and as a book runner with respect to a public offering of the Company’s 3.625% senior
unsecured notes due May 2030 (aggregate principal amount $500,000,000) in May 2020. We also have provided
certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Parent and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our
Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a book runner
with respect to a public offering by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, a subsidiary of Parent, of its
investment grade bonds due in 2051 (aggregate principal amount $925,000,000) in March 2021; as a book runner with
respect to a public offering of Parent’s JPY-denominated senior notes (aggregate principal amount $2,316,000,000) in
April 2020; and as a book runner with respect to a public offering of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation’s
investment grade bonds (aggregate principal amount $575,000,000) in April 2020. We may also in the future provide
financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Parent, the Significant Shareholder and their
respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to
stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2021;
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst
reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its
management, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with
members of the senior managements of the Company regarding the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other
companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the insurance and reinsurance industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies
and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed
with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we
have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. We are not actuaries and our services did not include any actuarial determination or
evaluation by us or any attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions and we have relied on your actuaries with respect
to reserve adequacy. In that regard, we have made no analysis of, and express no opinion as to, the adequacy of the
loss and loss adjustments expenses reserves of the Company. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any
adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed
that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification
of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor
does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. We were not requested to solicit, and did not solicit,
interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any
other alternative transaction. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $848.02 in cash per Share to be paid to
such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any
other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the
fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other

part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:
(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and be
converted into the right to receive $848.02 in cash, representing $850.00 per Share less the financial advisory fee
due to the Financial Advisor in connection with the Merger, payable to the holder of such Share, without
interest (the “Merger Consideration”), upon surrender of either certificates formerly representing such Shares
(“Certificates”) or any book-entry Shares (“Book-Entry Shares”) in the manner provided in Section 2.2. All
such Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and
cease to exist. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.
(b) Each Parent Owned Share and each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company will be
cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect to such Parent
Owned Shares.
(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately

(a) Before the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) to
receive the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a). When and as needed, Parent
or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in a separate account for
the benefit of holders of Shares (the “Payment Fund”) the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such
holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(a). If for any reason the cash in the
Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each

holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (i) a letter of transmittal (which must specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal, and will be in such form and have such other provisions as the Company and
Merger Sub may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for surrendering Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter until the
first anniversary of the Effective Time surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon delivery of a properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in exchange for the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, multiplied by the
number of Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, Parent Owned
Shares and shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company) will represent solely the right to
receive the aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.
(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled Shares is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name surrendered Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such
payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax is not applicable.
(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there will not be any
further registration of transfers of any Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to
any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares,
Parent Owned Shares and shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company) are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares which immediately before the Effective Time represented the Shares.
(e) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any cash, including any interest received with respect to
such cash, and any Certificates or other documents, in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the “Transactions”), which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest on such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.3, such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or
other securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements (each, a “Company Performance Share”), including
any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto, and that is outstanding immediately prior to the

equal to the Merger Consideration (provided that, for purposes of determining the number of Company
Performance Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of Company Performance
Shares will be determined assuming the maximum level of performance was achieved) which (1) shall vest in full
(to the extent the applicable performance period has not been completed prior to the Effective Time), for the
avoidance of doubt, without any ongoing performance-vesting conditions (x) if the recipient of such Company
Performance Share remains in continued employment or other service with Parent and its Subsidiaries through
the last day of the performance period applicable thereto as set forth in the performance share award agreement
pursuant to which such Company Performance Share was granted as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or (y) if the employment or other service of the recipient of such Company Performance Share is terminated
by the Company or its Subsidiaries without “cause” or terminated due to recipient’s death, “total disability” (as

Highly Compensated Employees Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DCP”) in accordance with its
terms as in effect on the date hereof (the “Prime Rate”)) from the Effective Time through the payment date, to
the recipient of such Company Performance Share in a cash lump-sum, less any required withholding Taxes, at
such time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and the related performance share award agreement.

Stock Plan, other than any Director RSUs, that is not subject to performance-based vesting requirements (each,
a “Company Restricted Stock Unit”), including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto, and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the recipient thereof, be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation a lump-sum amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration which shall vest in full (to the extent
the corresponding Company Restricted Stock has not already vested prior to the Effective Time) and, if vested,
be paid, together with interest credited thereon, compounded annually, at the Prime Rate from the Effective Time
through the payment date, to the recipient of such Company Restricted Unit in a cash lump-sum, less any
required withholding Taxes, within fifteen Business Days of the earlier of (i) the applicable vesting date of such
Company Restricted Stock Unit set forth in the restricted stock award agreement pursuant to which such
Company Restricted Stock Unit was granted as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
recipient’s continued employment or other service with the Company and its Subsidiaries through such date, or
(ii) the termination of the recipient’s employment or other service by Parent or its Subsidiaries without Cause or
terminated due to recipient’s death, Total Disability or Qualified Retirement (subject to any required delay in
payment required by Section 409A of the Code); provided that, if the corresponding Restricted Stock Unit
vested prior to the Effective Time, such cash amount shall be paid within fifteen Business Days of the Effective
Time, without

any interest thereon. For purposes of this Section 2.3(b), “Qualified Retirement” also requires the approval of
the Company’s chief executive officer after the applicable employee has provided to the Company’s chief
executive officer at least ninety days’ notice of an intent to retire (or with respect to the Company’s chief
executive officer, approval by Parent’s chief executive officer or the compensation committee of Parent’s Board
of Directors after the Company’s chief executive officer has provided to Parent’s chief executive officer or the
compensation committee of Parent’s Board of Directors at least ninety days’ notice of an intent to retire).
(c) At the Effective Time, each notional Share represented by restricted stock units granted under the
Company’s 2005 Directors’ Stock Plan, the Company’s 2010 Directors’ Stock Plan or the Company’s 2015
Directors’ Stock Plan (collectively, the “Director RSUs”), including any dividend equivalent units credited in
respect thereto, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the recipient thereof, be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a lump-sum amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration which shall be paid,
together with interest credited thereon, compounded annually, at the Prime Rate from the Effective Time through
the payment date, to the recipient of such Director RSU in a cash lump-sum, less any required withholding
Taxes, at such time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and the related award document or
applicable deferral election.
(d) At the Effective Time, any amounts for which a “common stock election” or a “stockholders equity election”
is in effect under the DCP shall be reinvested into the notional Prime Rate alternative thereunder and no further
“common stock elections” or “stockholders equity elections” will be permitted under the DCP from and after the

effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall equal the product of (A) the number of Shares deemed
invested in or otherwise referenced by such account immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger
Consideration, and (ii) the amount for which a “stockholders equity election” is in effect immediately prior to the

Company.
(ii) Each Company Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received
a favorable determination letter to that effect from the IRS and the Company is not aware of any event
occurring since the date of such determination that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
determination. The Company does not maintain any Company Plan that is primarily for the benefit of
Covered Employees based outside of the United States.

made or suffered a “complete withdrawal” or a “partial withdrawal,” as such terms are respectively defined

result in the imposition of any such Encumbrance on any such assets, on account of any Company Plan
pursuant to Section 303(k) of ERISA or Section 430(k) of the Code.

Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Date), the Company agrees not to waive or fail to
enforce any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party relating to a potential
or actual Takeover Proposal (unless the Company Board determines in good faith, after considering applicable
provisions of applicable Law and after consultation with outside counsel, that enforcing or not waiving such
provision would otherwise prevent a Takeover Proposal from being made to the Company).

provisions of applicable Law and after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be

Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information required under the HSR Act and in
connection with approvals of or filings with any other Governmental Entity or Insurance Regulator) required to

with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by the Transactions or by this Agreement,

date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to
Closing.
(b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this Agreement with respect
to, and provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the
other parties (or their counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any
other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to
this Agreement of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions. If any
party to this Agreement or any Affiliate of such parties receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such party will use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to
this Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. To the extent that transfers of any
permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation
and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to all inquiries and information requests received from any state
Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters.
(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman

efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any other Transactions, including by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal unless, by mutual agreement,
Parent and the Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.3(d) shall limit the right of any
party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, so long as such party hereto has, up to the

promptly as practicable in each relevant jurisdiction and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond, as

or other Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under

contrary, in no event shall Parent or its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub and, after the Closing, the Surviving

Section 6.7 Indemnification.",110,111
ALLEGHANY CORP DE_20220429_DEFM14A_20052995_4452227.Pdf,Indemnification,"Indemnification.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the “Indemnified Parties”) against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party of or in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether
pertaining to any action or omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the
Transactions, provided, however, that, in the case of the Surviving Corporation, such indemnification shall only
be to the fullest extent a corporation is permitted under Delaware Law to indemnify its own directors and
be to the fullest extent a corporation is permitted under Delaware Law to indemnify its own directors and
officers, and in the case of indemnification by Parent, Parent’s indemnification shall not be limited by Delaware
Law, but Parent shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party if a final, non-appealable judgment or
adjudication in an action against any such Indemnified Party by a claimant (not including an action brought by
Parent, Surviving Corporation, or any insurer of either) with respect to such claims establishes: (A) that the acts
or omissions of such Indemnified Party were the result of deliberate criminal or fraudulent acts by the
Indemnified Party; or (B) that the claim against such Indemnified Party arises out of, is based upon, or is
attributable to the gaining in fact of any financial profit or other advantage to which such Indemnified Party was
not legally entitled. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will pay all expenses
of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware Law. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii) Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such
matter, provided that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
of any claim effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.7, upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have under this Section 6.7 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party). The
Indemnified Parties (as a group) may each retain only one law firm (in addition to local counsel in each
applicable jurisdiction if reasonably required) to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is
a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.
(b) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with
respect to indemnification and exculpation set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and
Restated By-laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would diminish or adversely affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party thereunder as of the Effective Time of any individual who at the Effective Time is an
Indemnified Party, unless such modification is required after the Effective Time by Law and then only to the
minimum extent required by such Law.
(c) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to any rights such individual
may have under the governing documents of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or
any other applicable Laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The rights under this Section 6.7 shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.
(d) In the event that Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
A-27TABLE OF CONTENTS
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.
(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.7 is not prior to or in substitution
for any such claims under such policies; provided, however, that following the Closing there shall be no
obligation to continue or extend such policies.

Surviving Corporation to provide, or cause to be provided, to the employees of the Company and to the
employees of each Subsidiary of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
“Company Employees”) who remain employed by the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, compensation
and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such Company Employees than the compensation
and benefits provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, determined on a
“company-by-company” basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations in this Section 6.9 shall not
restrict Parent and the Surviving Corporation from making changes that (A) are consistent with changes
currently planned or contemplated by the Company, or (B) are collectively bargained for. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all Company Plans; provided, however, that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may amend, modify or terminate any individual Company Plan in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law (including obtaining the consent of the other parties to and
beneficiaries of such Company Plan to the extent required thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not, after
the Effective Time, provide any form of equity-based compensation.
(b) For purposes of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and other employment
agreements, arrangements and policies of the Surviving Corporation under which an employee’s benefits
depend, in whole or in part, on length of service, credit will be given to current employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or predecessors prior to the Effective
Time, provided that such crediting of service does not result in duplication of benefits and that such service
would have been recognized under the corresponding Company Plan.
(c) The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the respective
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.9, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company
Employee, legal representative or beneficiary thereof, or any other person any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits, of any
nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 6.9, express or implied (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii)
shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of such entities.
