A summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and which is incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement, is described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement.” Among other things, the
Merger Agreement includes the following terms:
•
Effective Time of the Merger; Closing. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders, we anticipate that the Merger will be
completed in the second half of 2022. The Company, however, cannot assure completion of the Merger by any particular date, if at all.
•
Conditions to the Merger. The closing of the Merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or waived (other than the
condition set forth in the first bullet below, which cannot be waived). These conditions, which are described more fully in “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Merger,” include:
•
The respective obligations of the parties to the Merger Agreement to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction (or mutual
waiver as of the closing by each of Parent and Covetrus where permitted under applicable law) of the following conditions: (i)
adoption of the Merger Agreement by Company’s stockholders in accordance with applicable law and the Company’s certificate
of incorporation and bylaws; (ii) the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act having
expired or been earlier terminated (the HSR Act waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. EST on July 8, 2022) and the other filings,
notices, reports, consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods, clearances or authorizations set forth
in the disclosure letter delivered by Covetrus in connection with the Merger Agreement having been filed, occurred or obtained,
as applicable; and (iii) no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered
any law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
consummation of the Merger.
•
The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent as of
the closing of additional conditions, including: (i) subject to materiality qualifiers in certain cases, the accuracy of each of our
representations and warranties
2Table of Contents
in the Merger Agreement; (ii) Covetrus’ performance and compliance with in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by or complied with by us under the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger; (iii) since the date of the
Merger Agreement, there not having occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties of Covetrus”); and (iv) the receipt by Parent of a signed certificate by a
senior executive officer of Covetrus at the closing of the Merger stating that the foregoing conditions have been satisfied.
•
Covetrus’ obligations to complete the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by us as of the closing of the Merger
of additional conditions, including: (i) subject to certain materiality qualifiers, the accuracy of each of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement; (ii) each of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s performance and
compliance with in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by or complied with by it under the Merger
Agreement as of the closing of the Merger; and (iii) the receipt by the Company of a signed certificate by an officer of Parent to
the effect that the forgoing conditions have been satisfied.
•
No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals. The Merger Agreement provides that we are not permitted to, among other things, directly or
indirectly through our representatives solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals—No Solicitation or Negotiation”).
•
Board Recommendation Changes. Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, under certain circumstances, we may, prior to the
time the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders, (x) provide non-public information in response to an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, subject to
certain conditions, and (y) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with certain third parties who have made such a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only if the Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) has
determined in good faith and after consultation with outside legal counsel that, based on the information then available and after
consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals—Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision”), and
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
The Merger Agreement also provides that, at any time before the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement, the
Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) may effect a change in recommendation (or terminate the Merger
Agreement) with respect to (x) an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal if the Board (acting on the recommendation of the
Transaction Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) certain material effects not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by (or if
known or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by) the Board prior
to the execution of the Merger Agreement and, in each case, the Company complies with certain procedures. The non-solicitation
provisions are described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement—Restriction on
Solicitation of Competing Proposals.”

Board supports as long as such adjournment is in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) and (b) against any action or agreement that
could reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled.

matters in any manner it chooses.
Further, pursuant to the Support and Rollover Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings has agreed to transfer, directly or indirectly, its shares of Company
common stock, which otherwise would be converted into the right to receive

In addition, CD&R VFC Holdings agreed to not take certain actions, including not (i) tendering any of its shares of Company common stock into any
tender or exchange offer, (ii) transferring any of its shares of Company common stock, (iii) granting any proxies or powers of attorney or (iv) taking
any action that would make any representation or warranty of CD&R VFC Holdings contained in the Support and Rollover Agreement untrue or
incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of preventing or disabling CD&R VFC Holdings from performing its obligations under the Support
and Rollover Agreement in any material respect. For additional information, see the section entitled “Support and Rollover Agreement.”

(see page 32)
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) formed a transaction committee, consisting of three of the Company’s non-management
members of the Board that are unaffiliated with CD&R and its affiliates (the “Transaction Committee”), to evaluate and consider, among other things,
any potential or actual proposal from CD&R and any other alternative proposals or other strategic alternatives that may be available to the
Company, including the Merger. After careful consideration, with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, the Transaction
Committee unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders and (iii) recommended to the Board to adopt and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, and recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
The Board (other than Ravi Sachdev and Sandra Peterson (the “Recused Directors”), who recused themselves due to their affiliation with CD&R),
acting upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii)
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be
submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt
the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, based on its evaluation and having received the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, the Board, by unanimous vote of the
Company’s directors (other than the Recused Directors), recommends that the Company’s stockholders vote (i) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal (as defined below) and (iii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal (as defined below).
For a discussion of the material factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions, see the section entitled “Special Factors—Reasons for
the Merger; Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the Merger.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to
the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its oral opinion to the Board and the Transaction Committee, subsequently confirmed in
writing, that, as of May 24, 2022 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $21.00 in cash per share to be paid
to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May 24, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory
services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board and, with respect to such opinion, the Transaction Committee in connection
with their consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common
stock should vote with respect to the Merger Agreement Proposal or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and
Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date
of announcement, at approximately $32 million, $2.5 million of which became payable at announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is
contingent upon consummation of the Merger.

If the Merger Agreement Proposal does not receive the required approval from Covetrus’ stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any

first lien secured cash-flow based revolving credit facility (up to $65,000,000 of which will be available at the closing of the Merger to finance the
Transactions and pay related fees and expenses), and $1,604,000,000 from equity investments by certain Equity Investors (as defined below), which

filed by Covetrus with the Securities Exchange Commission on June 30, 2022 in connection with the Merger contains alleged material misstatements
or omissions. The Actions seek, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with, consummating or closing the Merger,
rescisissory damages should the Merger not be enjoined, and an award of attorneys’ and experts’ fees. The defendants believe that the allegations

Under Delaware law, if the Merger is completed, holders of Company common stock who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for, the judicially determined fair
value of, their shares of Company common stock, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration. The “fair value” could be higher or lower than, or
the same as, the Merger Consideration. The relevant provisions of the DGCL are included as Annex D to this proxy statement. Covetrus
stockholders are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal, Covetrus stockholders who are considering exercising that right are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel. Failure to comply strictly with these provisions may result in the loss of the right of appraisal. For additional information, see the section

Proposal”), as discussed in the section entitled “Special Factors—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning
on page 68; and
•
a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate to ensure that any necessary supplement or
amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is provided to Company stockholders a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
special meeting or solicit additional proxies in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Adjournment Proposal”).

outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter. Abstentions and failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.
The approval of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal requires, assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority in voting power of the shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter, present or represented by proxy. Although the
Board intends to consider the vote resulting from this proposal, the vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on Covetrus or

Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Covetrus stockholders and the Merger is completed, the
compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not
approved. Failure to vote will have no effect on approval of the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Company
common stock entitled to vote on such matter, present or represented by proxy.
In addition, the Presiding Officer (as defined in the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Covetrus) or the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
in voting power of the shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter, present or represented by proxy, may adjourn such
meeting to a later date and time. Failure to vote will have no effect on approval of the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
A:
The Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, have been unanimously approved and recommended by the Transaction
Committee. The Board, by a unanimous vote of the Company’s directors (other than the Recused Directors), recommends a vote (i) “FOR” the
Merger Agreement Proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and (iii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

As of September 7, 2022, there were 140,122,753 shares of Company common stock outstanding. If you are a Covetrus stockholder as of the close
of business on the record date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through the internet or at the special meeting via the virtual meeting website,
you will be considered part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Company common stock and you provide your bank,
broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a
“street name” holder of shares of Company common stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting
instructions, then your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.
All shares of Company common stock held by stockholders that attend the special meeting via the virtual meeting website, or are represented by
proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their
proxy that they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special
meeting may be adjourned.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Covetrus’ named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?
A:
In July 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid
or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Merger. In
accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Covetrus is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast
a non-binding advisory vote on compensation that may be paid or become payable to Covetrus’ named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. For additional information, see the section entitled “Proposal 2: Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,” beginning on page 125.
Q:
What will happen if Covetrus stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal?
A:
The vote to approve the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Approval of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning
that it will not be binding on Covetrus or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by
Covetrus’ stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our
named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.
Q:
What do I need to do now? How many votes do I have?

how to demonstrate proof of stock ownership, are posted at proxydocs.com/CVET.
Submitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet will not prevent you from casting your vote at the special meeting via the

Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What is the deadline for voting my shares of Company common stock?
A:
If you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on
October 10, 2022.
If your shares of Company common stock were purchased through the ESPP and are held through your account with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, you must vote such shares by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 10, 2022.
If you choose to submit your proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card must be completed, signed, dated and returned in the enclosed
postage-paid reply envelope or otherwise filed with our Corporate Secretary no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 10, 2022. You may also
attend the special meeting virtually. If you are a beneficial owner, please review the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee for information on the deadline for voting your shares.
Q:
If my shares are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other nominee vote those shares for me
with respect to the proposals?
A:
Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of Company common stock at the special meeting unless
you provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee
on how to vote your shares with respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be
able to vote by telephone or through the internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.
Q:
What if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?
A:
Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares of Company common stock unless you have properly instructed
your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter, the failure to provide your nominee with voting
instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal. Furthermore, your shares of Company common stock
will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present.

Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or through the internet?
A:
Yes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy by delivering
a signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy is revoked and bearing a date later than the date of the proxy delivered to Margaret
Pritchard, Secretary, Covetrus, Inc., 7 Custom House Street, Portland, Maine 04101. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by
submitting another proxy by telephone or through the internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may also submit
a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares. If you voted by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should
retain a copy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or change your vote by
telephone or through the internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting
website and voting at the meeting. However, simply attending the special meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy. “Street
name” holders of shares of Company common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to
revoke or change their proxies.
If you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of Company common stock, you must follow the instructions
received from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.
All properly submitted proxies received by us before the special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being exercised at the special
meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided,
“FOR” each of the proposals.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
A:
If you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of Company common stock that are registered in more than one account. For
example, if you own your shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you
will receive, and you will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record
ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of Company common stock are voted, you will need to submit your proxies by mailing in
each proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the internet by using the different voter control number(s) on each proxy card.
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two or more stockholders reside,
unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases,
each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate
information and reduces printing and mailing expenses. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of Company common stock, you may
have already received a householding notification. For additional information, see the section entitled “Householding of Proxy Material,”
beginning on page 144.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Company common stock before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of completion of the Merger. If you own shares of Company common stock
as of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special
meeting, but the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, holders
of record of shares of Company common stock who have perfected
19
Table of Contents
and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of
their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed. Appraisal rights only will be available to these holders if
they deliver a written demand for an appraisal to Covetrus prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the special meeting and they
comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal
amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger
Agreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 127.
Q:
If I hold my shares of Company common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. Shortly after the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal that includes detailed written instructions on how to return your
stock certificates. You must return your stock certificates in accordance with such instructions in order to receive the Merger Consideration.
PLEASE DO NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) NOW.
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A:
We and Parent are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed during
the second half of 2022, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The
Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by Covetrus stockholders. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger,”
beginning on page 107.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to
vote on such matter, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for
your shares of Company common stock. Instead, Covetrus will remain a public company, and Company common stock will continue to be registered
under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar to that in
which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of Company common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and
opportunities to which they are currently subject with respect to their ownership of Company common stock.
In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Covetrus is required to pay Parent a termination fee of
$88,315,000. The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent may be required to pay Covetrus a termination fee of $197,950,000 if the Merger
Agreement is terminated due to certain reasons related to Parent’s breach or failure to close. For additional information, see the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees,” beginning on page 110.
For additional information, see the section entitled “Special Factors—Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed,” beginning on page 74.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
The Company will publish final voting results from the special meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the
special meeting. For more information, please see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Covetrus is seeking the adoption by its stockholders of the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into Covetrus. Covetrus will survive the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
The Transaction Committee has approved and recommended to the Board the Merger Agreement Proposal, and the Board has approved the Merger
Agreement and unanimously recommends that Covetrus stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.
At the Effective Time, each share of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company common stock (i) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries (including the shares of
Company common stock transferred by CD&R VFC Holdings, directly or indirectly, to Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) owned by
Covetrus as treasury stock and (iii) owned by Covetrus stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL), will be converted into the right to receive $21.00 in cash, without interest thereon.
Following the completion of the Merger, Covetrus will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Background of the Merger
The Board, together with the Company’s management, regularly reviews and discusses the Company’s performance, risks, strategy and opportunities, as
well as its competitive environment and trends. As part of this periodic review and assessment, from time to time, the Board and the Company’s
management consider potential strategic alternatives, including strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and may receive inquiries from third parties
seeking to determine the Company’s interest in a sale transaction in whole or in part.
CD&R VFC Holdings became the beneficial owner of approximately 10.1% of the outstanding shares of the Company common stock as a result of the
February 2019 transaction between Henry Schein and Direct Vet Marketing, Inc., which created the Company and resulted in CD&R’s investment in Direct
Vet Marketing, Inc. being exchanged for common stock in the Company. In connection with the closing of the 2019 transaction, Ravi Sachdev, a CD&R
partner, became a director of the Company.
In an effort to strengthen the Company’s liquidity position and balance sheet, the Company, with the assistance of financial advisors Ardea Partners LP
and Goldman Sachs, in early 2020 reached out to parties it believed could potentially be interested in a preferred equity investment in the Company.
Following negotiations between the Company and several parties, on April 30, 2020, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment
Agreement”) with CD&R VFC Holdings pursuant to which CD&R VFC Holdings agreed to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company’s Convertible Series
A Preferred Stock (the “Private Placement”). In May 2020, as a result of the closing of the Private Placement, CD&R VFC Holdings’ shareholding
increased to the equivalent of approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock on an as-converted basis. In connection with the
Private Placement and pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Board increased in size to elect an additional director, to be nominated by CD&R VFC
Holdings and mutually agreed by the Company and CD&R VFC Holdings. Shortly after the closing of the Private Placement, CD&R partner Sandra
Peterson became a director of the Company. Effective November 18, 2020, all of CD&R VFC Holdings’ shares of Convertible Series A Preferred Stock had
been converted into shares of Company common stock pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation, resulting in CD&R VFC Holdings owning
33,670,541 shares of Company common stock.
The Investment Agreement includes a standstill provision (the “Standstill Agreement”) that, among other things, prohibits CD&R and its affiliates from
increasing their ownership stake in the Company or making an
22Table of Contents
acquisition proposal of any kind to the Company without prior Board approval. From time to time, CD&R has considered alternatives for its investment in
the Company, including the possibility of selling the Company common stock held by CD&R VFC Holdings or participating in some other form of
transaction involving the Company. In August 2021, following the receipt by the Company of unsolicited inquiries from a few financial sponsors
regarding the potential sale of the Company, Mr. Sachdev discussed with Benjamin Wolin, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, CD&R’s
possible interest in having the Board explore potential strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, including the acquisition of all of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock by a third-party buyer or potentially by CD&R, although no proposal regarding an acquisition of
additional shares of Company common stock was made by Mr. Sachdev. Mr. Wolin discussed with Philip Laskawy, Chairman of the Board, his discussion
with Mr. Sachdev, and thereafter, Mr. Sachdev discussed CD&R’s perspectives on the receipt by the Company of unsolicited inquiries from financial
sponsors, at a meeting of the Board held on September 20, 2021. Following discussions with the Board in September 2021, representatives of the
Company’s management contacted Goldman Sachs and Lincoln International (“Lincoln”, together with Goldman Sachs, the “Financial Advisors”), based
upon their respective reputations, qualifications, experience in mergers and acquisitions, financial analyses, financing and capital markets and familiarity
with the Company and the industry in which the Company operates, to assist the Company in developing a preliminary view with respect to the
Company’s valuation, the market generally and potential strategic alternatives, if any, that may be available to the Company.
At a meeting on September 23, 2021, the Board (other than the Recused Directors) reviewed with representatives of its legal advisor and Lincoln, the fact
that the Company had received certain unsolicited indications of interest, and potential benefits and considerations in connection with pursuing any
such indications, including the risk of a leak. The representatives of Lincoln discussed with the Board considerations regarding process and timing with
respect to a review of potential strategic alternatives, as well as an initial list of potential counterparties that might have interest and capacity to engage in
such a transaction. Following discussion regarding potential strategic alternatives, including continuing to execute on the Company’s plan on a
standalone basis and the potential benefits of each alternative, the Board determined it would continue to review additional information to be prepared by
management and its financial advisors at its next meeting.
At a meeting on September 30, 2021, the Board reviewed, together with its legal advisor and Goldman Sachs, the Company’s financial analyses, the market
generally and potential strategic alternatives, if any, that may be available to the Company, including the possibility of exploring a transaction with a third-
party buyer or potentially with CD&R. The Recused Directors (Ms. Peterson and Mr. Sachdev) recused themselves from participation in the Board’s
discussion given the possibility that, if the Board were to explore a sale of the Company, CD&R could be among the parties that could be interested in
participating in such a transaction. For that reason, references to the Board in this section of this proxy statement, unless otherwise specified, are to the
Board without the participation of the Recused Directors. The Board discussed whether to engage with the parties that had expressed an interest in
pursuing a transaction and, if so, whether to approach additional potential counterparties. Following discussion, the Board determined that the Company
should not solicit indications of interest from potential acquirors at such time and should inform CD&R that the Company was not for sale, but that
CD&R could receive limited due diligence materials, pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality provisions in the Investment Agreement, in order to
permit CD&R to further develop its views regarding the Company. Following the Board meeting, Messrs. Laskawy and Wolin informed Mr. Sachdev of
the Board’s determination.
At a meeting on October 25, 2021, the Board again met with representatives of Goldman Sachs to further discuss Goldman Sachs’s preliminary
presentation to the Board in September, including in respect of market and industry conditions and their preliminary perspectives on financial analyses.
Mr. Wolin discussed with the Board the fact that CD&R had, during the course of the prior weeks, asked certain follow-up questions related to due
diligence matters, which the Company answered, but that the Company had not yet received any proposal from CD&R.
In late October 2021, Mr. Sachdev communicated to Mr. Wolin that he and Ms. Peterson would like the opportunity to speak with the other members of
the Board regarding their perspectives on the Company. At a
23
Table of Contents
regularly scheduled Board meeting on November 4, 2021, the Board discussed Mr. Sachdev’s request of Mr. Wolin. After discussion, the Board requested
that Mr. Wolin coordinate with Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson a time for them to share their perspectives on the Company.
At a Board meeting on November 24, 2021, which Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson attended, Mr. Sachdev discussed with the Board CD&R’s perspectives
on the Company’s business, including with respect to competition and potential growth strategies for the Company. In addition, Mr. Sachdev indicated
that CD&R continued to consider alternatives for its investment in the Company, including the possibility of selling the Company common stock held by
CD&R VFC Holdings, depending on price and terms, as well as acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Company common stock not then owned by
CD&R VFC Holdings. Mr. Sachdev confirmed to the Board that CD&R did not have a proposal to make to the Company at that time and, prior to the
making of any such proposal, the Board would need to waive the Standstill Agreement. Following that discussion, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson
departed the meeting, and the rest of the Board continued its discussion regarding the conversation with Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson, including in
connection with Mr. Sachdev’s indication that CD&R may be supportive of transactions involving the sale of all outstanding shares of Company
common stock, including shares of Company common stock then owned by CD&R VFC Holdings, to a third party, as well as a transaction involving the
sale of all outstanding shares of Company common stock other than those then owned by CD&R VFC Holdings, in each case, depending upon price and
terms.
At a meeting on December 3, 2021 with members of management and representatives of the Company’s legal advisor and Goldman Sachs participating,
the Board discussed with management, among other things, the Company’s long-range business plan and potential challenges that might impact the
Company’s execution of its business plan and the Company’s business generally, including customer consolidation, suppliers “going direct”, increased
market competition, the performance of the Company’s compounding business and certain strategic business initiatives. Management also discussed
with the Board certain potential opportunities with respect to the Company’s business, including the ability to leverage data to stabilize supplier
economics and market share capture opportunities for generics and proprietary branded products. The Board then continued its discussions with
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs regarding the Company’s business and the market and a range of potential strategic alternatives for
the Company, including continuing to execute on the Company’s strategic plan, divestiture of non-core assets, return of capital to stockholders (either
through a sale of the whole Company or a sale of its parts), as well as a potential timeline for a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of
the Company, and the identity of potential parties who might be interested in a transaction involving the Company and capable of acquiring the
Company.
Following the December 3, 2021 Board meeting, Mr. Sachdev indicated to Mr. Wolin and Mr. Laskawy that, if the Board were to consider exploring a sale
of the Company, CD&R’s preliminary view on the value of the Company at that time was in the range of $24.00 per share (which represented an
approximately 43% premium to the closing price of $16.79 of the Company common stock on December 3, 2021). Mr. Wolin relayed this communication to
other members of the Board and, as a result, the Board established the Transaction Committee, comprising Mr. Laskawy, Mark Manoff and Sharon
Wienbar, each of whom is an independent member of the Board, unaffiliated with CD&R, to, among other things, review and evaluate strategic
alternatives that might be available to the Company.
On December 9, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and the
Company’s legal advisors, at which, among other things, the Board received an update from representatives of Goldman Sachs on the recent performance
of the Company’s stock price and preliminary financial analyses considerations, and continued their discussion from prior meetings regarding various
strategic alternatives, as well as process and timing considerations with respect to such alternatives, including a divestiture of the Company’s
international distribution business, a sale of the Company and an investment in certain areas of the Company’s business. The Board also discussed with
management and its advisors the preliminary view on the value of the Company that had been communicated by CD&R to
24
Table of Contents
Mr. Laskawy and Mr. Wolin. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders to initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. Therefore, the Board directed the Company’s
management to formally retain Goldman Sachs and Lincoln as the Company’s financial advisors (subject to negotiating an acceptable engagement letter
with each), in each case, based upon their respective reputations, qualifications, experience in mergers and acquisitions, financial analyses, financing and
capital markets and their familiarity with the Company. As part of this process, the Board authorized and directed the Financial Advisors to contact
parties that might be interested in a potential strategic transaction with the Company, with the Transaction Committee providing guidance, oversight and
support in connection with this process. During that period, Mr. Wolin, Mr. Laskawy and Mr. Sachdev further discussed CD&R’s preliminary view on the
value of the Company communicated on December 3, 2021.
On December 23, 2021, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of the Company’s Financial Advisors and legal advisors, as well as
management to discuss, among other things, process and timing considerations with respect to strategic alternatives that might be available to the
Company, including a potential sale of the Company. Representatives of the Financial Advisors provided the Transaction Committee with an overview of
a sale process, including an overview of the workstreams associated with the sale process, as well as a list of potential parties who might be interested
and capable of engaging in a transaction involving the Company. The members of the Transaction Committee discussed and considered the likely timing
of such a sale process. During the course of the discussion, Mr. Wolin informed the Transaction Committee that he had received an unsolicited indication
of interest from a party with respect to the potential acquisition of the Company’s SmartPak business, and the Transaction Committee discussed with
management and its advisors the impact of a sale of the SmartPak business on the Company, including the potential to dilute the Company’s technology
segment financial performance. However, the Transaction Committee concluded that, if the third party proposed a compelling financial offer, the
Transaction Committee and the Board would entertain such a proposal. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee directed the Financial Advisors
to finalize the proposed list of potential parties, as well as work with management regarding the outreach script and the preparation of an initial data room.
In December 2021 and January 2022, the Company, with the assistance of the Financial Advisors, prepared materials for a potential sale process, including
a management presentation, supplemental financial information, and a financial model, in advance of initial outreach to potential interested parties. The
Company and the Financial Advisors also prepared a list of potential strategic companies and financial sponsors who might be interested in and capable
of executing a transaction with the Company, for discussion with and approval by the Board.
Between January 3, 2022 and February 11, 2022, the Transaction Committee held several meetings with the Company’s management and representatives of
the Financial Advisors and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, its legal advisor (“Weil”), to discuss the process to review strategic alternatives, including a
potential sale, during which Goldman Sachs provided updates on the process, including the level of interest initially expressed by potential parties.
During this time, the Company’s Financial Advisors and Weil also discussed with CD&R the role that CD&R would play in the sale process, and CD&R
agreed that it would not participate formally in the process at that time but would be willing to speak with potentially interested parties if requested to do
so by, and subject to the prior approval of, the Transaction Committee.
During January 2022, representatives of the Financial Advisors, at the direction and on behalf of the Company, conducted a broad outreach to potential
parties, which together with inbound contacts, resulted in the Financial Advisors engaging with 24 parties, five of which were strategic companies
(including Company A (as defined below) but contact with Company A began in February, as described below)) and nineteen of which were financial
sponsors (not including CD&R, but including each of the financial sponsors who made unsolicited inquiries in August 2021), regarding a potential
strategic transaction with the Company. Of the 24 parties, the Company signed confidentiality agreements with 17 parties (including TPG, which entered
into a confidentiality
25
Table of Contents
agreement with the Company on February 7, 2022), and each confidentiality agreement included a customary standstill provision. Other parties that the
Financial Advisors contacted declined to participate in the process for a variety of reasons, including the complexity of the business, concerns regarding
potential challenges facing the distribution business and the impact of consolidation. Each party that signed a confidentiality agreement was provided
access to certain non-public materials regarding the Company’s business and operations and a call with members of the Company’s management team. Of
the 17 parties, four declined to participate further in the process for various reasons including other business priorities and the size of the investment
required by the potential transaction. On February 15, 2022, the Transaction Committee and the Company’s advisors relayed to the Board an overall
summary update of the process.
On February 9, 2022 and February 16, 2022, the Company entered into engagement letters with Goldman Sachs and Lincoln, respectively, formalizing the
engagement of the Financial Advisors to act as the Company’s co-financial advisors to, among other things, assist the Company in evaluating strategic
alternatives for the Company, including a potential sale of the Company.
During February and early March 2022, members of the Company’s management team held management presentations and Q&A sessions (with two
strategic companies and 15 financial sponsors, including TPG) and subsequent diligence sessions at certain of which representatives of the Financial
Advisors participated, as did advisors of the strategic companies and financial sponsors. Management did not conduct a management presentation with
CD&R, but did hold a Q&A session at which CD&R received an update on current performance trends.
On February 18, 2022, at the direction of the Company, representatives of the Financial Advisors delivered a process letter to the 12 remaining parties
(comprising two strategic companies and 10 financial sponsors, including TPG but not including CD&R) that had signed confidentiality agreements and
participated in management meetings with the Company requesting that each party submit a non-binding written proposal with respect to a strategic
transaction with the Company by no later than March 9, 2022. On February 24, 2022, representatives of the Financial Advisors sent an additional process
letter to one financial sponsor who executed a confidentiality agreement after the February 18, 2022 distribution.
During the course of February 2022, a representative of a strategic party (“Company A”), which has a commercial relationship with the Company,
contacted Mr. Sachdev regarding pursuing a potential transaction involving the Company, as a result of hearing that the Company may be exploring
strategic alternatives. Following that discussion, Mr. Sachdev informed Mr. Wolin of the contact, and they briefly discussed how Company A’s interest
could potentially impact the Company’s general strategic plans, irrespective of whether a transaction with Company A or any other party was ultimately
pursued. Mr. Wolin thereafter informed Mr. Laskawy of the discussion with Mr. Sachdev, and Messrs. Wolin and Laskawy discussed the possibility of a
transaction with Company A and the considerations that could arise given Company A’s existing commercial relationship with the Company. Following
that discussion, Mr. Wolin had several discussions with representatives of Company A, and Company A was invited to participate in the Company’s
process to review strategic alternatives.
On March 9, 2022, the deadline for submitting indications of interest in connection with the sale process, TPG submitted a non-binding written proposal
to acquire all of the shares of Company common stock for a purchase price in the range of $21.00 to $22.00 per share in cash, subject to TPG’s completion
of its due diligence. TPG was the only party that submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire all of the shares of Company common stock by the
deadline reflected in the process letter.
On March 15, 2022, a representative of Company A called a representative of Goldman Sachs to indicate that an offer for the acquisition of the Company’s
global technology business (the “GTS Business”) for cash consideration in an enterprise value range of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion would be
forthcoming.

On March 17, 2022, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of the Financial Advisors and
Weil, as well as Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson who attended a portion of the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting Mr. Sachdev shared CD&R’s
perspective on the Company’s business. Following that discussion, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson departed the meeting, and the Board received an
update on the status of the sale process, including the outreach and due diligence that had occurred to date. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman
Sachs reviewed with the Board a summary of the outreach efforts and feedback received from parties who had declined to move forward. The
representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed with the Board changes in the market that had occurred since the previous Board meeting, including an
approximate 10% decline in the equity markets since December 2021, significant volatility in the equity markets in 2022, increases in interest rates,
geopolitical tension and the fact that equity market valuations were depressed relative to recent historical valuations, with the S&P 500 EV/EBITDA
multiple being down 1.6x since December 7, 2021, and also discussed with the Board the Company’s stock price performance over the same period.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed with the Board that Company A indicated a proposal for the acquisition of the GTS Business in an
enterprise value range of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion was forthcoming. Goldman Sachs further discussed with the Board and management that
Company A had been highly engaged and had indicated that it was interested in exploring a potential transaction. The Board, management and the
advisors discussed key considerations with respect to the process, including timing, engagement of the potential buyers, strategies for creating
competitive tension to try and drive the most successful outcome, whether there were other parties (in particular financial sponsors) who might be
interested in acquiring the Company’s distribution business that could be partnered with Company A to facilitate a transaction involving the entire
company, the risks of not reaching a successful outcome of the sale process, the possibility of separating the distribution and technology businesses,
and considerations of the alternatives currently available. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders to continue with the sale process and directed Goldman Sachs to both identify financial sponsors who might be
interested in partnering with Company A, and to work with Company A to try and improve its valuation in order to provide a compelling price for the GTS
Business. Later that day, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of management, the Financial Advisors and Weil to discuss next steps with
respect to Company A, and strategies to maximize the value for the Company and the stockholders related to a transaction with Company A.
Following the Board meeting on March 17, 2022, Company A sent a non-binding written proposal for the acquisition of the GTS Business for cash
consideration in an enterprise value range of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, or approximately 18x to 21x their 2022 projected pro forma adjusted
EBITDA for the GTS Business. Representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Company A and provided the feedback from the Board
meeting.
On March 20, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted a representative of Goldman Sachs and provided an updated verbal indication of interest to
acquire the GTS Business for cash consideration in the range of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion, subject to confirmatory due diligence, which increased offer
reflected revised assumptions regarding corporate allocations, the exclusion of a particular product line, to which a lower multiple had been assigned and
a willingness to increase the multiple they would ascribe to the GTS Business.
On March 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Weil to discuss, among other things, the Company A proposal from March 20, 2022. The Transaction Committee asked questions of
management and the advisors regarding Company A’s proposal and the likelihood of finding a financial sponsor to partner with Company A. Following
discussion, the Transaction Committee directed Goldman Sachs to prepare a preliminary analysis regarding what they thought Company A could pay for
the GTS Business, and requested that management and Goldman Sachs conduct an analysis with respect to a transaction with Company A that would
leave behind a public company distribution business, and the considerations associated with such a transaction. The Transaction Committee also
requested that the advisors discuss with CD&R to understand CD&R’s current views on valuation, given the changes in the stock market and the
economy generally.

On April 4, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of the Financial
Advisors and Weil, as well as Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson as representatives of CD&R. The CD&R representatives had been invited to attend the
meeting to share CD&R’s current views on valuation. At the meeting, the representatives of CD&R communicated to the Transaction Committee that, if
invited to make a proposal by the Board and subject to the Board granting a waiver of the Standstill Agreement, CD&R would be prepared to consider
exploring a potential transaction at a valuation in the range of $21.00 to $22.00 per share of Company common stock (which represented a 23% to 29%
premium to the closing price of $17.01 of the Company common stock on April 1, 2022). Mr. Sachdev discussed with the Transaction Committee the
reasons for the view on valuation, including the increased cost of capital, as well as challenges facing the Company, including with respect to
consolidation in its end-markets. Mr. Sachdev also informed the Transaction Committee that if CD&R were to move forward with exploring a possible
transaction, it would need to partner with another financial sponsor and that it was willing to explore a possible transaction with a number of financial
sponsors, including TPG. The members of the Transaction Committee and representatives of CD&R then discussed certain other matters regarding a
possible transaction, and following that discussion, the representatives of CD&R left the meeting.
After the CD&R representatives left the meeting, the Transaction Committee discussed the Company A proposal and the possibility of exploring a
transaction within the range of values communicated by CD&R. The Transaction Committee also discussed potential responses and options to proceed
with the potential parties with management and the Company’s advisors, as well as the Company’s recent financial performance. The Transaction
Committee and Goldman Sachs also discussed the possibility that a particular financial sponsor who had declined to move forward in the broader sale
process, but who might have an interest in acquiring the Company’s distribution business, based on its investment history, might serve as a potential
partner for Company A, so that a sale of the entire company could be accomplished. The Transaction Committee requested that Goldman Sachs connect
with the financial sponsor (“Financial Investor A”) to ascertain its level of interest and to determine its willingness to partner with Company A, and
determined that these matters would be discussed with the whole Board at the upcoming meeting and that it would be appropriate for the CD&R
representatives to be invited to that meeting to discuss CD&R’s current views on valuation with the full Board. The Transaction Committee reconvened
with its advisors on April 6, 2022 to briefly discuss the updates the Board would receive the following day.
On April 7, 2022, the Board held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil, as well
as, for certain portions, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson as representatives of CD&R. During the meeting, the Board (including the Recused Directors)
received an update from Mr. Wolin on the performance of the Company. In addition, the CD&R representatives discussed with the Board CD&R’s current
views on valuation and the reasons for their revised valuation relative to what they had communicated in December, including increased interest rates,
higher financing costs and equity market deterioration. Following such discussion, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson departed the meeting.
The Board then discussed CD&R’s revised views on valuation and the factors identified by the CD&R representatives for its revised views, as well as the
Company’s recent financial performance, the Company’s headwinds and tailwinds and the trends management was seeing both with respect to the
Company and companies in similar industries. The Board also discussed the proposal from Company A and the viability of a sale of just the GTS
Business. The Board further discussed the interest of Financial Investor A and potential partnering between Financial Investor A and Company A, as
well as a partnering of CD&R and TPG, in each case, in order to achieve a sale of the entire Company. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs
reviewed with the Board a financial overview of the valuation range communicated by CD&R and the proposal from Company A, and reviewed with the
Board the fact that they had approached another company to see whether it would be interested in a distribution-only transaction, but that that company
had declined. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to continue
the process of exploring a sale, and that it would be beneficial to that process to allow CD&R to partner with TPG and to try and facilitate a partnering of
Financial Investor A and Company A.

Following the Board meeting on April 7, 2022, a representative of Goldman Sachs informed representatives of CD&R and TPG that they could proceed
with discussions regarding potentially partnering together to make a proposal to acquire the Company. Additionally, on April 8, 2022, a representative of
Goldman Sachs invited Financial Investor A into the sale process. On April 8, 2022, a representative of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of
CD&R and TPG to communicate details on the process going forward.
Following the communication from the representative of Goldman Sachs, CD&R and TPG began their joint due diligence efforts. At the invitation of the
Company, during April and May 2022, the Company’s management team, advisors to the Company, CD&R, TPG and representatives and advisors of
CD&R and TPG, including Debevoise & Plimpton LLP (“Debevoise”), legal counsel to CD&R and TPG, held several due diligence meetings on subject
areas including finance, strategy, product and technology, human resources, network, information technology, intellectual property, corporate
governance, material contracts, regulatory, tax, data privacy, real estate, sanctions and compliance.
On April 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of the Company’s management and Goldman Sachs to discuss the partnership of
Company A and Financial Investor A and directed the Financial Advisors and the Company’s management to facilitate due diligence for both parties.
Later that day, the Company’s management, Goldman Sachs and Weil held a meeting with Financial Investor A and Company A to discuss due diligence
and process going forward.
On April 15, 2022, Financial Investor A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that it was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of the Company’s
distribution business (nor an acquisition of the whole Company). As a result, Company A did not have a party with whom to partner to acquire the
portions of the Company’s business that were not included in Company A’s GTS Business proposal.
On April 16, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil to discuss, among other things, the fact that Sponsor
A had determined not to move forward with its evaluation of a potential transaction involving the Company and the implications that that determination
had with respect to a potential transaction with Company A. The Transaction Committee also discussed and considered with the advisors next steps with
respect to Company A, including whether there were other potential partners for Company A and negotiation strategies to obtain the maximum value for
the Company in connection with a transaction with Company A, particularly in light of relevant tax considerations. The Transaction Committee requested
that representatives of Goldman Sachs prepare materials to discuss with the Board at its upcoming meeting that include a calculation of illustrative net
proceeds that would be recognized from a sale of the GTS Business, given the costs of separation and tax leakage identified by the Company’s
management, and indicative values resulting from financial analyses of the “whole company.”
On April 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs made an initial draft of the Merger Agreement available in the virtual data room.
Also on April 20, 2022, the Board held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil, at
which, among other things, the Board received an update on the sale process, including the discussions with CD&R, TPG and Company A, as well as the
update that Financial Investor A determined not to proceed with a potential acquisition of the Company’s distribution business, and due diligence that
had occurred to date. The Board also received an overview from representatives of Goldman Sachs on the benefits and considerations of a sale of the
whole Company, a sale of just the GTS Business (leaving a distribution-only public company remaining thereafter, including the tax implications thereof)
and continuing to execute on the Company’s strategic plan on a standalone basis. The Board discussed with the representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Weil the considerations and challenges of being a standalone distribution-only public company, including the likely valuation the public markets would
ascribe to such a business and the challenges of separating the Company’s businesses in such a manner, the proceeds that would be received from the
sale of the GTS Business and another product line in order to achieve the same valuation as a sale of the
29
Table of Contents
whole Company at various valuations (taking into account tax costs), and how that compared to the proposal from Company A, as well as the length of
time it could take to consummate such a transaction and the execution risk associated with such a transaction, including as a result of regulatory
approvals. The Board also discussed with the representatives of Goldman Sachs whether there were other potential parties, including CD&R, that may be
interested in partnering with Company A. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company to
continue discussions with CD&R and TPG and with Company A regarding the possibility of a potential strategic transaction, and instructed the advisors
to set a timeline for the remaining interested parties to make their proposals. Pursuant to the Board’s discussion, later on April 20, 2022, a representative
of the Company reached out to CD&R to discuss whether CD&R would be interested in exploring a possible transaction with Company A. As a result of
that discussion, representatives of CD&R and Company A briefly discussed the possibility of partnering in exploring a possible transaction, but
following such discussions decided to not pursue such a partnership.
In April 2022, the Company’s management and representatives entered into discussions about a potential transaction with an additional potential
strategic party; however, the party declined to enter into a confidentiality agreement and ultimately did not move forward in the process.
On May 16, 2022, representatives of CD&R and TPG spoke to a representative of Goldman Sachs, to communicate that, if invited by the Transaction
Committee and subject to obtaining a waiver of the Standstill Agreement, CD&R and TPG acting together would be prepared to consider further exploring
a possible transaction at a valuation of $20.00 in cash per share of Company common stock (which represented a 31% premium to the closing price of
$15.27 of the Company common stock on May 13, 2022). The CD&R and TPG representatives indicated that the lower valuation was primarily due to
volatile financing markets with widened credit spreads, an improved understanding of the number of shares of Company common stock that were
outstanding (resulting in an increased cost of acquisition) and a decrease in the Company’s cash position forecasts. Later that day, the Transaction
Committee met with representatives of the Company’s management, Goldman Sachs and Weil to discuss the valuation communicated by CD&R and TPG,
including the recent trends in the equity and debt markets (including in light of recent macroeconomic conditions), as well as illustrative premia for a
range of transaction values and proposed next steps with respect to negotiations with CD&R and TPG. The Transaction Committee determined it would
discuss the matters the following day with the Board.
On May 17, 2022, the Board held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil, at
which the Board received an update on the sale process and due diligence that had occurred to date and an overview from representatives of Goldman
Sachs on the valuation communicated by CD&R and TPG on May 16, 2022. The Board received an overview of the reasoning communicated for the
proposed valuation being below TPG’s value range submitted on March 9, 2022 and CD&R’s value range communicated on April 4, 2022, and discussed
the fact that there was no partner for the portions of the Company’s business that Company A would not acquire. After deliberations and discussions,
including regarding the Company’s recent financial performance and management’s views regarding the strengths of and challenges facing the
Company’s core businesses, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to continue discussions with
CD&R and TPG to explore a possible transaction, but instructed the Transaction Committee and Goldman Sachs to inform CD&R and TPG that the
valuation communicated by CD&R and TPG on May 16, 2022 did not reflect sufficient value for the Company’s stockholders. The Board authorized the
Transaction Committee to go back to CD&R and TPG and indicate that the Company would not be willing to further explore a transaction at the valuation
previously communicated by CD&R and TPG on May 16, 2022 and would need to receive a higher per share price in order to continue exploring a
possible transaction.
On the evening of May 18, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of CD&R and TPG and conveyed the Board’s message from the
May 17, 2022 meeting.
On May 19, 2022, Mr. Sachdev spoke with Mr. Laskawy to communicate that, if invited by the Transaction Committee to make a proposal and, subject to
receiving a waiver of the Standstill Agreement, CD&R and TPG
30
Table of Contents
acting together would be prepared to consider exploring a possible transaction at a valuation of $20.50 in cash per share of Company common stock. Mr.
Laskawy informed Mr. Sachdev that $20.50 per share did not represent sufficient value for the Company’s stockholders. Later that day, Mr. Sachdev
spoke with Mr. Laskawy again and communicated an updated valuation of $21.00 in cash per share of Company common stock. Following the
discussions on May 19, 2022, the Board convened with representatives of management, Goldman Sachs and Weil to discuss this communication.
During the meeting, the Board discussed with management and its advisors the updated valuation from CD&R and TPG, the alternatives to the Company
of doing a transaction, including the execution risk, as well as benefits, associated with implementation of its long-term business plan and the immediate
value for the Company’s stockholders that an all-cash transaction would provide. The Board also discussed with its advisors the fact that all parties that
had signed confidentiality agreements and participated in management meetings with the Company, other than CD&R and TPG, had either declined to
proceed with exploring a potential transaction with the Company for a variety of reasons or had been unable to submit an offer for the whole Company.
Following deliberation and discussion, the Board determined that, subject to negotiation of the terms of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction
documents, it believed that the valuation communicated on May 19, 2022 was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders, and was
supportive of moving forward with exploring a potential transaction with CD&R and TPG and, therefore, of granting CD&R a limited waiver (the “Limited
Waiver”) of the Standstill Agreement in order to permit the submission of a proposal, as well as to permit CD&R to pursue, develop and, if later approved
by the Board upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, enter into a transaction contemplated by such proposal. Following the Board
meeting, Mr. Laskawy called Mr. Sachdev and relayed the Board’s determination.
On May 19, 2022, the Company granted CD&R the Limited Waiver. Following the granting of the Limited Waiver, on May 19, 2022, Debevoise, on behalf
of CD&R and TPG, submitted a letter setting forth CD&R’s and TPG’s non-binding proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company common
stock that were not owned by investment funds managed by CD&R for cash consideration of $21.00 per share of Company common stock (the
“CD&R/TPG Proposal”) to the Transaction Committee. The CD&R/TPG Proposal represented a 37.5% premium to the closing price of $15.27 of the
Company common stock on May 13, 2022 (the last trading day before the trading in the Company common stock appeared to be affected by market
rumors or otherwise), a 38.8% premium to the Company’s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of May 13, 2022 and a 34.8% premium to the
Company’s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of May 19, 2022, the last trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the
CD&R/TPG Proposal was publicly filed.
On May 20, 2022, CD&R publicly disclosed the proposal letter in an amendment to its Schedule 13D filings with respect to the Company. On May 20,
2022, the Company filed a current report on Form 8-K disclosing the granting of the Limited Waiver and the receipt of the CD&R/TPG Proposal.
In connection with the delivery of the CD&R/TPG Proposal, representatives of Debevoise provided representatives of Weil with a revised draft of the
Merger Agreement shared by the Company in the virtual data room on April 20, 2022. From May 19, 2022 through May 24, 2022, the Company, CD&R,
TPG, Parent and their respective legal advisors negotiated the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents. Significant areas of discussion and
negotiation included: (i) the level of conditionality in the Merger Agreement, including with respect to domestic and foreign antitrust and other regulatory
filings, (ii) the regulatory efforts standards and the standard for possible divestitures or other remedies in connection with applicable antitrust and other
regulatory clearances, (iii) the termination fees payable by the Company and Parent in certain circumstances, (iv) the financing and financing cooperation
obligations of Parent and the Company and their impact on transaction certainty, (v) the “drop dead date,” and (vi) the scope of the representations and
warranties and covenants of the parties.
On May 23, 2022, the Transaction Committee and the Board, which, for the avoidance of doubt, did not include the Recused Directors, held a meeting
attended by members of the Company’s management and
31
Table of Contents
representatives of the Financial Advisors and Weil, at which the Transaction Committee and the Board discussed the potential transaction with Parent.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Transaction Committee and the Board its financial analyses of the merger consideration of $21.00
per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon. At the conclusion of its presentation, Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board its
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing on May 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of May 24, 2022, and based upon and subject to the various
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such written opinion, the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Company
common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be paid to the holders of Company common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Goldman Sachs’s opinion, please see below under
the section entitled “Special Factors— Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.” Further, representatives of Weil reviewed with the directors their
fiduciary duties and a summary of the key terms of the draft Merger Agreement, as of such date. Following the presentations by Goldman Sachs and
Weil, and after further discussing the CD&R/TPG Proposal, the Transaction Committee and the Board discussed the potential reasons for and against the
potential transaction (see below under the section entitled “Special Factors— Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the
Merger”). At the conclusion of the discussions, the Transaction Committee unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii)
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) recommended to the Board to adopt and
declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption
of the Merger Agreement. The Board, other than the Recused Directors, acting upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, unanimously (i)
approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,
(iii) resolved to recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) directed that the Merger Agreement be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company for its adoption. The Board authorized the Company’s management to, together with the Company’s
advisors, finalize the negotiation of the outstanding items in the transaction documentation in accordance with the Board’s guidance.
During the course of May 23, 2022 and May 24, 2022, Company management and the Company’s advisors finalized negotiating the transaction
documentation with CD&R, TPG, Parent and their advisors.
On May 24, 2022, the Company and Parent executed the Merger Agreement, concurrently with which the Company, Parent and CD&R VFC Holdings
executed the Support and Rollover Agreement.
On May 25, 2022, prior to the opening of trading of the Company common stock on NASDAQ, the Company and Parent issued press releases
announcing the transaction and the execution of the Merger Agreement.
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the Merger
The Board (which, for purposes of this section of this proxy statement entitled “Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the
Merger,” means the Board without the participation of the Recused Directors), formed the Transaction Committee to evaluate and consider strategic
alternatives that may be available to the Company, including any potential transaction involving CD&R.
After careful consideration, with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, the Transaction Committee unanimously (a) approved and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement, (b) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and (c)
recommended to the Board to adopt and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the
32
Table of Contents
Transactions, including the Merger, and recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and the Board (other
than the Recused Directors), acting upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the
Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, (ii) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (iii) directed that the Merger
Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, based on its evaluation and having received the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, the
Board recommends that the Company’s stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal
and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. In addition, the Transaction Committee and the Board believe that the merger is fair to the Company’s
“unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act.
In evaluating the Merger, the Transaction Committee and the Board consulted with independent legal and financial advisors, as well as the Company’s
management team, and considered a number of factors that supported its decision to approve the Merger Agreement (not necessarily in order of relative
importance) and the Merger, including the following:
•
Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is all
cash, which provides the Company’s stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Company common stock and
enables the Company’s stockholders to realize value that has been created by the Company and does not expose them to any future risks
related to the business or the financial markets generally, as compared to the Company remaining independent (especially when viewed
against the potential risks and uncertainties inherent in Covetrus’ business, including risks related to management’s standalone plan and
changing competitive dynamics). Specifically, among other things, the Transaction Committee and the Board considered:
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium value for the Company’s stockholders, including a 39% premium to the
Company’s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of the unaffected date of May 13, 2022;
•
the trading history of the Company and the Merger Consideration relative to such history; and
•
the belief that the Merger Consideration represents the highest price that CD&R and TPG (together, the “Sponsors”) were willing to
pay considering the negotiations between the parties.
•
Value Relative to Stand-Alone Prospects of the Company. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Merger
Consideration compares favorably to the potential value of the Company and the Company common stock if the Company were to remain as
a stand-alone entity after taking into account the risks and uncertainties associated with this alternative, in light of a number of factors,
including:
•
assessing the Company’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected financial performance
and the nature of the animal health industry in which the Company operates, including recent industry trends and changing
competitive dynamics;
•
the strategic alternatives reasonably available to the Company on a stand-alone basis, and the risks and uncertainties associated with
those alternatives;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to the Company’s efforts to develop and market new products, as well as the complexities
associated with managing a business comprising both a technology platform and a distribution business;
•
the risks and uncertainties related to increased competition in the markets in which the Company competes or may compete in the
future; and
33
Table of Contents
•
the possibility that the Company’s competitors may be more successful in gaining access to talent and resources and the negative
result that such competitive pressure may have on the ability of the Company to execute on its core business objectives.
•
The Sale Process: The Transaction Committee and the Board also considered:
•
that a sale process was conducted and that the Company, together with Goldman Sachs and Lincoln, communicated with 24 potential
strategic and financial sponsor parties believed by the Company, Goldman Sachs and Lincoln to be most likely to be interested in, and
capable of entering into, a transaction to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company;
•
that of the 24 potential acquirers contacted, 17 entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company and were granted due
diligence access to the Company;
•
that only one of the potential acquirers (TPG) that engaged in discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company
submitted an indication of interest with regard to the acquisition of the entire Company;
•
the fact that, following the public disclosure on May 20, 2022 of the Sponsors’ proposal to acquire the shares of Company common
stock that CD&R VFC Holdings did not already own at a price of $21.00 per share, none of the Company, Goldman Sachs or Lincoln
received any inquiries from any third parties concerning a potential acquisition of all or any portion of the Company or any other
strategic alternative. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered that, if any third parties were interested in exploring a
transaction with the Company, such potential acquirers would have been motivated to approach the Company during the period
following the May 20, 2022 public disclosure of the Sponsors’ $21.00 per share proposal, and considered, after consultation with
Goldman Sachs and Lincoln, that no other potential transaction party was likely to be both willing and able to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of the Company at a valuation of $21.00 per share or greater; and
•
Sponsors’ indication to the Transaction Committee that the $21.00 merger consideration was the highest price they were willing to
offer, and that such offer had been increased because of the negotiating efforts of the Transaction Committee and the Company’s
advisors, and the Transaction Committee’s belief, after discussion with its advisors and based on the course of negotiations with the
Sponsors that $21.00 per share was the maximum price that the Sponsors would offer.
•
Negotiation Process. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement were the result
of robust arm’s-length negotiations conducted by the Transaction Committee, with the knowledge and at the direction of the Board, and
with the assistance of independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel.
•
Opinion of Financial Advisors. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently
confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 24, 2022 that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the offer price of $21.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such Company stockholders, as more fully described below under the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Special Factors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,” and the full text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
including:
•
the provision allowing the Board to change its recommendation prior to obtaining the stockholder approval in specified
circumstances relating to a superior proposal or intervening event, subject to
34
Table of Contents
Parent’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment of the termination fee of $88,315,000;
•
the provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions
(including certain rights of Parent to match the superior proposal and payment of the termination fee of $88,315,000);
•
that affiliates of the Sponsors provided limited guarantees with respect to their portion of the payment of the termination fee of
$197,950,000 that may be owed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as well as certain reimbursement obligations that may be
owed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the limited
guarantees;
•
the Board’s belief, after discussion with the Company’s advisors, that the $88,315,000 termination fee, which constitutes
approximately 2.9% of the Company’s equity value in the Merger, would not preclude a superior proposal from being made;
•
Parent having obtained committed debt financing from reputable financial institutions and committed equity financing from affiliated
funds of the Sponsors in an aggregate amount sufficient to fund the required amounts;
•
the provision obligating Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done all things necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the debt and equity financing on terms (including the “market flex” provisions) and conditions
no less favorable to Parent than those described in the commitment letters;
•
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, including the limited number and nature of the conditions to complete the
Merger (including regulatory conditions), and the provisions of the Merger Agreement requiring Parent to, subject to certain
exceptions, use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary,
proper or advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable law to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or
any governmental entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
and
•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the Merger.
•
Opportunity for the Company’s Stockholders to Vote. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Merger would
be subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders, and the Company’s stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote
for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the special meeting.
•
Timing of Completion. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Merger, and the structure of the Merger and concluded that the Transactions, including the Merger, could be
completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The Transaction Committee and the Board also considered that the potential
for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period during which the Company’s business would be subject to the
potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
•
Operating Flexibility. The fact that the Merger Agreement provides the Company sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in
the ordinary course consistent with past practices until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the termination of the Merger
Agreement (as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement—Covenants Regarding Conduct of Business by Covetrus Prior to
Merger”).
35
Table of Contents
•
Specific Performance. The Company’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of
Parent and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other breaches of the Merger Agreement.
•
Commitment by CD&R. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the commitment of CD&R VFC Holdings in the Support and
Rollover Agreement to, among other things:
•
vote or cause to be voted at the special meeting any shares of Company common stock owned by it in favor of the Merger and the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or necessary or desirable in
furtherance of the Merger and the other Transactions, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Support and Rollover Agreement, and against any action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions to the consummation of the Merger under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled (as more fully described under “The
Merger Agreement—CD&R’s Obligation to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Support and Rollover Agreement”).
•
Understanding of Different Interests. the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) made their evaluations of
the Merger Agreement and the Merger based upon the factors discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the
interests of CD&R and its affiliates in the Merger.
In the course of their deliberations, The Transaction Committee and the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors
concerning the Transactions, including:
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all cash
transaction means that the Company would no longer exist as an independent public company following the consummation of the Merger
and that the Company’s stockholders (other than CD&R VFC Holdings) will not participate in future earnings or growth of Parent and will
not benefit from any appreciation in value of the Surviving Corporation.
•
Closing Conditions and Financing. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’
•
Closing Conditions and Financing. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’
obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the Company’s stockholders, as well as
the risk that the equity or debt financing contemplated by the equity and debt commitment letters will not be obtained, resulting in Parent
and Merger Sub not having sufficient funds to complete the Transactions.
•
Risks Associated with Parent and Merger Sub. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that Parent and Merger Sub
are newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the limited guarantees, provided by each of the Equity Investors, guarantees
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement only with respect to payment of the termination fee of $197,950,000
payable by Parent and certain other reimbursement obligations.
•
Interim Operating Risks. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company’s
business prior to the completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which, despite providing sufficient
flexibility for the Company to operate its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practices, could delay or prevent the
Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take with respect to the operations
of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the possibility that the
Transactions, including the Merger, might not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:
•
the Company’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have
experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the Transactions;
36
Table of Contents
•
the Company will have incurred significant transaction costs;
•
the Company’s continuing business relationships with customers, partners and employees may be adversely affected;
•
the trading price of shares of Company common stock could be materially and adversely affected; and
•
the market’s perceptions of the Company’s prospects could be adversely affected.
•
No Solicitation and Termination Fee. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that subject to certain exceptions, the
Merger Agreement precludes the Company from soliciting or entertaining alternative acquisition proposals and requires the Company to
pay Parent a termination fee of $88,315,000 in certain circumstances.
•
Remedies. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Company’s remedies in the event that the Merger
Agreement is terminated may be limited to the termination fee of $197,950,000, payable by Parent under certain circumstances and certain
associated enforcement costs and reimbursement obligations, which may be inadequate to compensate the Company for any damage
caused.
•
Effects of Transaction Announcement. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the effect of the public announcement of the
Merger Agreement, including effects on the Company’s stock price, and the Company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel during
the pendency of the Transactions, as well as the potential for legal proceedings, judgments or settlements following the announcement of
the Transactions and the associated costs, burden and inconvenience involved in defending those proceedings, judgments and
settlements.
•
Risks Related to CD&R. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that CD&R VFC Holdings’s ownership interest in
the Company would likely be taken into account by third parties considering whether to make an unsolicited acquisition proposal prior to
the receipt of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders, and the fact that, if the Merger Agreement is
terminated in connection with the Company’s entry into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, such third parties would
likely seek to have CD&R VFC Holdings agree to vote its shares of Company common stock in favor of such superior proposal.
•
Timing Risks. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including that
completion of the Merger depends on factors outside of the Company’s or Sponsors’ control (including the approval of the Merger by the
Company’s stockholders), and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the
execution of the Merger Agreement could divert the Company’s management’s attention and have an adverse impact on the Company,
including its client and other business relationships.
•
Taxable Consideration. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the exchange of Company common stock for
cash in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Other Risks. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement, see “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 incorporated by reference
herein and the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The Transaction Committee and the Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were
outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.
In addition to considering the factors described above, the Transaction Committee and the Board also considered that some of the Company’s directors
and executive officers have interests that may be different from,
37
Table of Contents
or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them at the time it
approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to the Company’s stockholders. See the section entitled “Special Factors—Interests of
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Transaction Committee and the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but
includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Transaction Committee and the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters,
neither the Transaction Committee nor the Board find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
Neither the Transaction Committee nor the Board undertook to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any
particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Transaction Committee and the Board each based their
recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation of the reasoning of the Transaction
Committee and the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information.”
The Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) believe that sufficient procedural safeguards were and are present to
ensure the fairness of the Merger and to permit the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) to represent effectively the
interests of the unaffiliated stockholders. These procedural safeguards include the following:
•
the Board formed the Transaction Committee, consisting of three of the Company’s independent directors who are independent of, and not
affiliated with, CD&R or its affiliates, to evaluate and consider any potential or actual proposal from CD&R and any other alternative
proposals or other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, including the Merger;
•
the members of the Transaction Committee will not personally benefit from the consummation of the Transactions in a manner different from
the Company’s stockholders (other than CD&R VFC Holdings and the other holders of excluded shares), except for indemnification and
continuing directors and officers liability insurance coverage and the vesting of certain Company equity awards upon the closing;
•
the Company retained independent financial and legal advisors to evaluate the Merger, and the Transaction Committee was empowered to
and did review and negotiate the Merger Agreement, the Transactions, including the Merger and the Merger Consideration, and any
alternatives thereto, and to make a recommendation to the Board as to what actions, if any, should be taken by the Company with respect
thereto;
•
at the direction of the Transaction Committee, the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, were
extensively negotiated by the Transaction Committee and the Company’s independent financial and legal advisors, and were closely
reviewed and scrutinized by the Transaction Committee, and, through negotiations, the Transaction Committee was able to increase the
Merger Consideration from $20.00 per share to $21.00 per share;
•
the approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of
Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter (as more fully described under “The Special Meeting—Vote Required for
Approval”);
•
the various terms of the Merger Agreement, including the ability of the Company to receive, negotiate and, under specified circumstances,
to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal (as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement”);
38
Table of Contents
•
the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) made their evaluations of the Merger Agreement and the
Merger based upon the factors discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the interests of CD&R and its affiliates in
the Merger;
•
the members of the Transaction Committee and the Board met frequently through the execution of the Merger Agreement to receive
updates; to review, among other things, the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, its strategic and
competitive positioning and historical and projected financial performance, its valuation, its long-range plans and the risk in achieving those
prospects and plans, as well as industry, economic and market conditions and trends; to review the Company’s strategic and commercial
alternatives and options, including the results of the sale process conducted and the likelihood or unlikelihood of other parties being willing
and able to engage in a stockholder-value-maximizing strategic transaction with the Company; and to consider and evaluate discussions
with CD&R and, ultimately, the proposal from the Sponsors; and
•
the members of the Board who are affiliated with CD&R have recused themselves and were excluded from all deliberations with respect to
the limited waiver of the standstill provisions of the Investment Agreement to allow the Sponsors to submit a proposal, the subsequent
negotiation, evaluation and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
In the course of reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, the
Transaction Committee and Board (other than the Recused Directors) did not consider the liquidation value of the Company, and did not believe it to be a
relevant methodology, because (1) they considered the Company to be a viable, going concern, (2) they considered determining a liquidation value to be
impracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of the Company and (3) the Company will continue to operate its business
following the Merger. Further, the Transaction Committee and Board (other than the Recused Directors) did not consider net book value, an accounting
concept, of the Company as a factor because they believe that net book value is not a material indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern
but rather is indicative of historical costs and because net book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, market conditions,
trends in the industries in which the Company operates or the business risks inherent in those industries. The Transaction Committee and Board (other
than the Recused Directors) were not aware of any firm offer for a merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company’s assets, or a purchase of a
controlling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company from anyone other than CD&R, TPG and Company A with respect
to the current transaction in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) did not seek to establish a pre-merger going concern value for the
Company to determine the fairness of the Merger, as they believed that such value was adequately reflected in the various analyses summarized in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Special Factors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,” that they considered in making their respective
determinations. In making its determination as to the fairness of the Merger, the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors)
considered a number of factors as summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Special Factors—Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the Merger,” including the opinion and analyses provided by Goldman Sachs as more fully summarized in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Special Factors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”, which opinion and analyses the Transaction
Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) adopted.

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the CD&R Entities may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required
to express their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated stockholders. Parent and Merger Sub are making the statements included in this
section solely for purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and the related rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. The view of
Parent and Merger Sub as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a
39Table of Contents
recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal. The CD&R Entities have
interests in the Merger that are different from, and in addition to, those of the unaffiliated stockholders of the Company.
The CD&R Entities did not participate in the deliberation of the Transaction Committee or the Board regarding, nor did they receive advice from the
respective legal or other advisors of the Transaction Committee or the Board as to, the fairness of the Merger. While two directors affiliated with the
CD&R Entities are on the Board, as discussed in “Special Factors—Background of the Merger,” such Recused Directors were excluded from all Board
deliberations relating to the approval of the Merger Agreement. The CD&R Entities have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform, any
valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated stockholders. Based on, among other things, the
factors considered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the Board and the Transaction Committee discussed in “Special Factors—Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the Merger” (which analysis and resulting conclusions the CD&R Entities adopt), the CD&R
Entities believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the unaffiliated stockholders. In particular, the CD&R Entities considered the following:
•
the current and historical market prices of the shares of Company common stock, including the market performance of the shares of
Company common stock relative to those of other participants in the Company’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the
Merger Consideration of $21.00 per share represented a premium of approximately 39% to the Company’s 30-day volume weighted average
price per share as of the unaffected date of May 13, 2022 and a premium of approximately 35% to the Company’s 30-day volume weighted
average price per share as of May 19, 2022, the last trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to
acquire the Company was publicly filed;
•
the fact that the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) unanimously approved and declared advisable
the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
its stockholders (including the unaffiliated stockholders);
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, thus allowing the unaffiliated stockholders to immediately realize a certain and fair value
for their shares, which value represents a significant premium over the Company’s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of the
unaffected date of May 13, 2022 and over the Company’s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of May 19, 2022, the last
trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to acquire the Company was publicly filed;
•
the fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the unaffiliated stockholders without the delays that would otherwise be necessary in
order to liquidate the positions of larger holders, and without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with market sales;
•
the fact that there are no conditions to the Merger that are unlikely to be satisfied, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will be
consummated and that the consideration to be paid to the unaffiliated stockholders in the Merger will be received; and
•
the potential risks to the Company of continuing to have publicly traded common stock, including the risks of market volatility and global
economic uncertainty.
The CD&R Entities further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the unaffiliated stockholders based upon, among other things, the following
factors:
•
the fact that a sale process was conducted, which included communication by the Company, together with Goldman Sachs and Lincoln, with
24 potential strategic and financial sponsor parties believed by the Company, Goldman Sachs and Lincoln to be most likely to be interested
in, and capable of entering into, a transaction to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company;
40
Table of Contents
•
the Board was fully informed about the extent to which the interests of the CD&R Entities in the Merger differed from those of the
unaffiliated stockholders;
•
the fact that the Recused Directors were excluded from certain Board discussions (including all discussions related to the Board’s
consideration of the initial offer from TPG and the subsequent offer from CD&R and TPG and the evaluation and negotiation of the
Transactions);
•
the fact that the Board formed a transaction committee consisting solely of non-management independent members of the Board not
affiliated with CD&R, which was empowered to and did review and negotiate the Merger Agreement, the Transactions, including the Merger
and the Merger Consideration, and any alternatives thereto, and was empowered to make a recommendation to the Board as to what
actions, if any, should be taken by the Company with respect thereto;
•
the fact that the Company retained, and the Transaction Committee and the Board had the benefit of advice from, nationally recognized legal
and financial advisors;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of the Transaction Committee’s arm’s length negotiations with Parent;
•
notwithstanding the fact that the opinion of Goldman Sachs was delivered solely to the Transaction Committee and the Board, and not to
the CD&R Entities, in connection with their consideration of the Merger, and is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of
Company common stock should vote with respect to the Merger Agreement Proposal or any other matter, and that the CD&R Entities are
not entitled to, nor did they, rely on such opinion, the fact that the Transaction Committee and the Board received an opinion from Goldman
Sachs that, as of May 24, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters set
forth therein, the $21.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of
Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders;
•
the fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders;
•
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide information to, or participate in
discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding acquisition proposals that constitute, or are reasonably likely to lead to, superior
proposals;
•
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement related to a superior proposal, subject to paying Parent a termination fee of $88,315,000 in cash, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
•
the availability of appraisal rights to the Company’s stockholders who comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law for
exercising appraisal rights, which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Company common stock.
The CD&R Entities also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the substantive and procedural fairness of the proposed
Merger, including:
•
the unaffiliated stockholders will not participate in any future earnings, appreciation in value or growth of the Company’s business and will
not benefit from any potential sale of the Company or its assets to a third party in the future;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all;
•
that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with essentially no assets other than the funding commitments of the Equity
Investors and the Debt Commitment Parties;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, which
may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business
41
Table of Contents
opportunities that may arise and certain other actions it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of the Company pending
completion of the Merger;
•
the negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger, could potentially have on the Company’s business
and relationships with its employees, vendors and customers;
•
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are restricted from soliciting, initiating,
knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer constituting, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
•
the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by the Company upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, including payment to
Parent of a termination fee of $88,315,000 in cash, and the processes required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the opportunity
for Parent to make revisions to its proposal, could discourage other potential acquirors from making a competing bid to acquire the
Company; and
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would generally be taxable to the Company’s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the CD&R Entities in connection with its evaluation of the
fairness of the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but includes all material factors considered by them. The CD&R Entities did not find it practicable
to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of the Merger. Rather,
the CD&R Entities reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The CD&R Entities believe
these factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated stockholders. This
position should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder to approve the Merger Agreement. The CD&R Entities
make no recommendation as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their shares relating to the Merger. The CD&R Entities attempted to
negotiate the terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the unaffiliated stockholders of the Company, and, accordingly, did
not negotiate the Merger Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to such stockholders.
Based on the CD&R Entities’ knowledge and analysis of available information regarding the Company, the Transaction Committee and the Board, as well
as discussions with the Transaction Committee, the Board and members of the Company’s senior management regarding the Company and its business

Certain Financial Projections Utilized in Connection with the Merger
Although Covetrus periodically provides guidance to the public regarding its financial performance for the then-current fiscal year, Covetrus does not, as
a matter of course, publicly disclose other financial forecasts given, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of these
forecasts and the associated underlying assumptions.
However, Covetrus is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain unaudited prospective financial information prepared by its management (the
“Financial Forecasts”) that has not previously been publicly disclosed, in order to provide Covetrus stockholders with access to information that was
made available to the Transaction Committee and the Board in connection with their evaluation of the proposed Merger and the Merger Consideration.
The Financial Forecasts with respect to Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2025 were
provided to the Sponsors in February 2022. In addition, the Financial Forecasts, including for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through
December 31, 2028, and with respect to Unlevered Free Cash Flow, were provided to Goldman Sachs and were used by
42
Table of Contents
Goldman Sachs in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Transaction Committee and the Board and the performance of the related financial
analyses, as described in the section entitled “Special Factors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,” beginning on page 45, but the Financial
Forecasts for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through December 31, 2028 were not provided to Parent or the Sponsors prior to entering into the
Merger Agreement.
The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement is not intended to influence any Covetrus stockholder with respect to the Merger
Agreement Proposal or for any other purpose, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to a stockholder’s shares of Company
common stock.
The Financial Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with GAAP, nor were they prepared with a view
toward compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. These projections are not fact and should not be relied upon as
necessarily indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial
information. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or
performed any procedures with respect to the Financial Forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on the Financial
Forecasts or the achievability of the results reflected in the Financial Forecasts, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with,
the Financial Forecasts. The Financial Forecasts may differ from published analyst estimates and the Financial Forecasts do not take into account any
events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger (nor, relatedly, any failure of the Merger to be
consummated).
Although presented with numerical specificity, the Financial Forecasts are subjective in many respects and, thus, are subject to interpretation and reflect
numerous variables, estimates and assumptions made by Covetrus management that Covetrus management believed were reasonable at the time
prepared, taking into account relevant information available to management at that time. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in such
Financial Forecasts not being achieved include the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the
Merger Agreement and the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the
principal terms thereof or the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the Merger, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or
refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Transactions, and risks and uncertainties pertaining to Covetrus’ business, including the factors
listed under “Risk Factors” set forth in Covetrus’ reports filed with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. In addition,
the Financial Forecasts may be affected by Covetrus’ ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable period. The
assumptions upon which the Financial Forecasts are based necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, industry performance and
competition, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, and other future events, and future business decisions that may not
be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including,
among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industry in which Covetrus operates, and the risks
and uncertainties described under the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” beginning on page 115, all of
which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond Covetrus’ control. The Financial Forecasts also reflect assumptions
that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for Covetrus’
business, changes in general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not
anticipated when the such forecasts were prepared. Therefore, Covetrus cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions underlying the Financial
Forecasts will be realized. In addition, given that the Financial Forecasts pertain to multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater
uncertainty with each successive year beyond their preparation. The estimates and assumptions in early periods have a
compounding effect on the projections shown for later periods. Thus, any failure of an estimate or assumption to
43
Table of Contents
be reflective of actual results in an early period would have a greater effect on projected results failing to be reflective of actual events in later periods.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Financial Forecasts will be realized, and actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from those
shown.
The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Covetrus, Goldman Sachs, the
Sponsors, Parent, Merger Sub, the CD&R Entities or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or
consider the Financial Forecasts necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the Financial Forecasts should not be relied upon as such. None of
Covetrus, Goldman Sachs, the Sponsors, Parent, Merger Sub, the CD&R Entities or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other
representatives can give any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Financial Forecasts, and Covetrus undertakes no obligation to update or
otherwise revise or reconcile the Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date such Financial Forecasts were generated or to reflect
the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Financial Forecasts are shown to be in error. None of
Covetrus, or, to the knowledge of Covetrus, the Sponsors, Parent or Merger Sub or the CD&R Entities intends to make publicly available any update or
other revisions to the Financial Forecasts, unless required by applicable law. None of Covetrus, Goldman Sachs, the Sponsors, Parent, Merger Sub, the
CD&R Entities or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any
stockholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance of Covetrus compared to the information contained in the Financial Forecasts or that
forecasted results will be achieved.
Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow, included in the Financial Forecasts, are “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial
performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow were utilized by Goldman
Sachs in connection with its opinion and by the Transaction Committee and the Board in connection their evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules that
would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures
included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy
statement. In addition, reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its
opinion or by the Transaction Committee or the Board in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Covetrus has not provided a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA or Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and any non-GAAP financial measures as
used by Covetrus may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are certain limitations in non-GAAP
financial measures, because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP
financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The material estimates and assumptions made by Covetrus management in connection with the Financial
Forecasts include:
•
With respect to Covetrus’s distribution business, projected compound annual growth rate in revenue through 2025 of approximately 6% to
9%, depending upon the geographic region;
•
With respect to Covetrus’s technology business (which includes SmartPak, Covetrus’s practice information management software systems
and its North American veterinary storefront), projected compound annual growth rate in revenue through 2025 of approximately 15.5%;
•
With respect to Covetrus’s distribution business, improvement of gross margin of approximately 0.6% through 2025 as a result of, among
other things, increasing penetration rates of high-margin private label products (depending upon the geographic region), partially offset by
supplier margin pressure and customer consolidation;
•
With respect to Covetrus’s technology business, improvement of gross margin of approximately 1.4% through 2025;
•
Revenue growth and improvements of gross margin for 2026 through 2028 assumed generally in line with prior years;
•
Decline in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, reflecting scale and leverage in Covetrus’s technology business and continued
gains in operating efficiency in Covetrus’s distribution business, partially offset by 3% annual inflation; and
Capital expenditures and changes in net working capital generally scaling in line with revenue.
For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Financial Forecasts.
COVETRUS DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE ABOVE FORECASTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING
AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT REALIZED.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the Merger Agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020,
and 2019, and the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018;
•

Company’s resale of shares of its common stock by certain selling stockholders who acquired the securities in a private placement;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
•
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
Company (which are referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement as the “Forecasts”), which are summarized in the section
entitled “Special Factors—Certain Financial Projections in Connection with the Merger.”
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of
Company common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies
the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the healthcare distribution, companion
animal health, and healthcare information technology industries and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered
such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Company’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility
for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company’s consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on
a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the
Transactions, including the Merger, in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the Transactions, including the Merger,
will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which
would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transactions, including the Merger, or the
relative merits of the Transactions, including the Merger, as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it
address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $21.00 in cash per share of Company
common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not
address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Transactions, including the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with
46
Table of Contents
the Transactions, including the Merger, including the fairness of the Transactions, including the Merger, to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the
Transactions, including the Merger, whether relative to the $21.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than
Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at
which the shares of Company common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the
Company or Parent, or the Transactions, including the Merger, or as to the impact of the Transactions, including the Merger, on the solvency or viability
of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was
necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its
opinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events
occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and the opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board,
and, with respect to such opinion, the Transaction Committee, in connection with their consideration of the Transactions, including the Merger, and such
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common stock should vote with respect to the Merger
Agreement Proposal or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Material Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs and presented to the Board and the Transaction Committee in
connection with rendering the opinion described above. The full text of the written presentation made by Goldman Sachs to the Board and the
Transaction Committee on May 23, 2022 has been attached as Exhibit (c)(2) to the Schedule 13e-3 in connection with the Transactions, including the
Merger, and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety (the “GS May 2022 Presentation”). The following summary, however, does not purport to be
a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or
weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The
tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before
May 19, 2022, the last trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to acquire the Company was publicly filed, and
is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for the shares of Company common stock for the
period beginning on February 8, 2019 and ending May 19, 2022. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of shares of
Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per share of Company common stock on May 19, 2022, the
last trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to acquire the Company was publicly filed, (ii) the volume
weighted average price (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement as “VWAP”) per share of Company common stock for the
preceding 30-, 60- and 90-trading day periods ended May 19, 2022, (iii) the closing price per share of Company common stock on May 13, 2022, the last
trading day before it appeared that the price of the shares of Company common stock may have been affected by market rumors or otherwise, and (iv) the
VWAP per share of Company common stock for the preceding 30-, 60- and 90-trading day periods ended May 13, 2022.
This analysis indicated that the price per share of Company common stock to be paid to Company stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement
represented:
•
a premium of 16.5% based on the closing price per share of Company common stock of $18.02 on May 19, 2022;
47
Table of Contents
•
a premium of 34.8% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $15.58 for the 30-trading day period ended May 19, 2022;
•
a premium of 29.4% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.23 for the 60-trading day period ended May 19, 2022;
•
a premium of 25.7% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.71 for the 90-trading day period ended May 19, 2022;
•
a premium of 37.5% based on the closing price per share of Company common stock of $15.27 on May 13, 2022;
•
a premium of 38.8% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $15.13 for the 30-trading day period ended May 13, 2022;
•
a premium of 30.3% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.12 for the 60-trading day period ended May 13, 2022;
and
•
a premium of 25.6% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.71 for the 90-trading day period ended May 13, 2022.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the
Company. Using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.5%, reflecting estimates of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of March 31, 2022, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the Company for the second, third and fourth quarters of
2022 and the years 2023 through 2028 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company, which were calculated
by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the
Company, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied exit terminal year EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from 6.5x to 10.7x). Goldman Sachs derived
such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement as
“CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-
tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the
United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and
experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the net debt of the Company of $904 million as
of March 31, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, to derive
a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully
diluted outstanding shares of the Company as of May 20, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use
by the management of the Company, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Company common
stock ranging from $14.76 to $27.02.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative
future price per share of Company common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of the
Company’s equity as a function of the Company’s estimated future earnings and its assumed price to future earnings per share multiple. For this analysis,
Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts to derive a range of theoretical future enterprise values for the Company for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by
applying a range of illustrative multiples of enterprise value to next twelve months (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement
as “NTM”) EBITDA (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement as “NTM EV/EBITDA”) of
48
Table of Contents
10.0x to 13.0x to NTM EBITDA estimates for the Company, based on the Forecasts. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs
utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical NTM EV/EBITDA multiples for the shares of Company common stock
during the period beginning January 1, 2022, and ending May 19, 2022, and certain selected distribution companies described in the section below
captioned “—Selected Public Company Comparables.”
Goldman Sachs then derived a range of theoretical future values per share of Company common stock for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024 by
subtracting the Company’s projected net debt as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, and dividing the result by the estimated fully-diluted
shares of Company common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, all as reflected in the Forecasts. Using an
illustrative discount rate of 11.7%, reflecting Goldman Sachs’ estimate of the Company’s cost of equity, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value the
range of theoretical future values per share of Company common stock it derived for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs derived the
illustrative discount rate of 11.7% by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well
as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of
Company common stock of $17.32 to $27.73.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the distribution,
companion animal health and healthcare information technology industries since 2012 with a total enterprise value of at least $1 billion.
For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied enterprise value of the applicable target company based on
the consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company’s EBITDA over the last twelve month (which is referred to for purposes of
this section of the proxy statement as “LTM”) period ended prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction (which is referred to for purposes of
this section of the proxy statement as “EV/LTM EBITDA”). While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions is directly
comparable to the Company, the companies included in the selected transactions are companies that operate in the distribution, companion animal health
or healthcare information technology industries with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company’s
results, market size and product profile.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples and Goldman Sachs’ professional judgment and experience, Goldman
Sachs applied an illustrative range of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples of 11.0x to 19.3x to the Company’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period
ended March 31, 2022 of $250 million, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of the
Company, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Goldman Sachs subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values the net
debt of the Company of $904 million as of March 31, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of the Company, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs divided the results by the number of fully
diluted outstanding shares of Company common stock as of May 20, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman
Sachs’ use by the management of the Company, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied values per share of Company common
stock of $12.74 to $27.02.
Premia Paid Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for 36 acquisition transactions
that closed during the time period from January 1, 2010 through May 18, 2022 involving a public company in the healthcare industry, excluding
transactions involving targets in the biopharmaceutical sector, involving a target based in the United States where the disclosed enterprise value for the
transaction was between $1.0 billion and $5.0 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the mean, 25th
percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to
announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a mean premium of 36.2% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile
premium of 23.9% and 75th percentile premium of 41.6% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative
premia of 23.9% to 41.6% to the (i) closing price per share of Company common stock of $18.02 as of May 19, 2022 and calculated a range of implied
equity values per share of Company common stock of $22.33 to $25.52 and (ii) unaffected closing price per share of Company common stock of $15.27 as
of May 13, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Company common stock of $18.92 to $21.62.
Selected Public Company Comparables. Using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared EV/EBITDA multiples for the
Company and the following selected group of publicly traded companies in the distribution industry, each with a market capitalization in excess of $1
billion and headquartered in the U.S. and listed on a U.S. stock exchange, which are referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the “selected
companies”:
•
Henry Schein, Inc.
•
McKesson Corporation
•
AmerisourceBergen Corporation
•
Patterson Companies, Inc.
•
Cardinal Health, Inc.
•
Owens & Minor, Inc.
Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, Goldman Sachs selected these companies because they are publicly
traded companies that operate in the distribution industry with certain operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain
operations of the Company.

Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of May 19, 2022 as a multiple of EBITDA for calendar year 2022 for each of the Company
and the selected companies, in each case based on Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System estimates and publicly available market data.
The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

stock during such period of $13.39 to $29.02.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to the Company or Parent or the contemplated transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board and Transaction Committee as to the fairness
from a financial point of view of the $21.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of
shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company, Parent,
Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was approved by the Board and
Transaction Committee. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any
specific amount of consideration to the Company, its Board, or the Transaction Committee, or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the
only appropriate consideration for the Merger.

As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board and Transaction Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board
and the Transaction Committee in making their respective determinations to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to
be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.

and TPG and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive
compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with CD&R and/or TPG and their respective affiliates from time to time and may
have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of CD&R and/or TPG from time to time and may do so in the future.
The Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 9, 2022, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its
financial advisor in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is
estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $32 million, $2.5 million of which became payable at
announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to
reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons
against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.",47,61

In connection with the Transactions, CD&R and TPG engaged Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”), an internationally recognized
investment banking firm, to provide limited financial advisory services to CD&R and TPG. In connection with Deutsche Bank’s engagement, Deutsche
Bank provided to representatives of CD&R and TPG, for informational purposes only, (i) discussion materials dated April 29, 2022 (the “April 29 DB
Discussion Materials”), (ii) discussion materials dated May 5, 2022 (the “May 5 DB Discussion Materials”), (iii) discussion materials dated May 7, 2022
(the “May 7 DB Discussion Materials”) and (iv) discussion materials dated May 13, 2022 (the “May 13 DB Discussion Materials” and, together with the
April 29 DB Discussion Materials, the May 5 DB Discussion Materials and the May 7 DB Discussion Materials, the “DB Discussion Materials”). Copies
of the DB Discussion Materials have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13e-3 and are incorporated herein by reference. The DB Discussion Materials
will be made available for inspection and copying at the principal executive offices of the Company during its regular business hours by any interested
equity security holder of the Company or a representative thereof who has been so designated in writing. The description of the DB Discussion Materials
set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such DB Discussion Materials.
The DB Discussion Materials were provided for the information of CD&R and TPG in connection with the proposed Transactions and were not provided
to the Company, the Transaction Committee or the Board prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement. Deutsche Bank was not asked to, and it did
not, among other things, (i) assist with any price or other negotiations in connection with the Transactions or otherwise, (ii) render or deliver any
opinion (whether as to the fairness of any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise) or
(iii) provide any recommendation as to how to vote or act on any matters relating to the Transactions or otherwise. In addition, the financial analyses
and observations reflected in the DB Discussion Materials were not analyses or observations with respect to the fairness of any consideration
(including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise, did not reflect an opinion of Deutsche Bank as to the fairness
of any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise and should not be viewed as a factor
considered by the CD&R Entities, TPG, the Board, the Transaction Committee, the Company’s management or otherwise with respect to the fairness of
any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise. Further, the DB Discussion Materials do
not constitute a recommendation to the CD&R Entities, TPG, the Board, the Transaction Committee, the Company’s management or otherwise with
respect to the fairness of any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise. Deutsche Bank
expressed no view as to, and it did not address, the underlying business decision of any party to the Transactions to effect or enter into the Transactions,
the relative merits of the Transactions as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for any such party or the effect of any other
transaction which any such party might engage in or consider. The DB Discussion Materials were preliminary and informational and are not reflective
of certain procedures typically applicable to materials or presentations in connection with delivering an opinion.
While the DB Discussion Materials include various analyses and observations (as described below), the CD&R Entities and TPG believe that those
analyses and observations were preliminary only and did not take into account all relevant factors; therefore, the CD&R Entities and TPG did not
consider such materials in determining an appropriate price for the Company or any of its business divisions, either in connection
56Table of Contents
with the Transactions or in future possible exit scenarios. The CD&R Entities and TPG did not rely on the DB Discussion Materials in negotiating the
consideration payable in the Transactions or any other terms of the Transactions or in deciding to enter into the Merger Agreement or the
Transactions. This section and the DB Discussion Materials have nevertheless been provided in response to certain regulations governing Schedule
13e-3 transactions.
In preparing the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify,
any information, whether publicly available or furnished to, discussed with or reviewed by Deutsche Bank, concerning the Company, its business
divisions or any other entity or business, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the preparation of the DB
Discussion Materials. Accordingly, for purposes of the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank assumed and relied upon the accuracy and
completeness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare, obtain
or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise), of
the Company, its business divisions or any other entity or business, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company, its
business divisions or any other entity or business under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Deutsche Bank expressed no view
as to any pending or potential litigation, claims or governmental, regulatory or other proceedings or investigations or the potential impact thereof on the
Company, its business divisions or any other entity or business, the Transactions or otherwise.
Deutsche Bank did not have access to or otherwise engage in any communications with the Board, the Transaction Committee, the management of the
Company or any of their respective advisors in preparing the DB Discussion Materials. Deutsche Bank relied primarily on the portion of the Financial
Forecasts provided to CD&R and TPG by the Company’s management. Deutsche Bank assumed that the financial and other information prepared or
provided by or discussed with CD&R and TPG were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then currently available estimates and judgments
as to the matters covered thereby. Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of any financial forecasts and projections or other
information utilized in its analyses or the assumptions on which they were based or the consideration payable in the Transactions.
The DB Discussion Materials did not in any manner address the value of Company common stock or the Company taken as a whole or the prices at
which Company common stock or other securities would trade following the announcement or consummation of the Transactions. Deutsche Bank did not
express any view with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to accounting, tax or other
consequences resulting from the proposed Transactions or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards or tax and other laws,
regulations and governmental and legislative policies affecting the Company, its business divisions or any other entity or business or the Transactions.
The preliminary financial considerations and other information in the DB Discussion Materials reflected market data proximate to such DB Discussion
Materials and were based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances in effect on, and information made available
to Deutsche Bank as of, the respective dates on which the DB Discussion Materials were prepared, as well as the portion of the Financial Forecasts
provided to CD&R and TPG by the Company’s management. Subsequent developments may affect the DB Discussion Materials and Deutsche Bank
expressly disclaims any undertaking or obligation to update, revise or reaffirm the DB Discussion Materials or to advise any person of any change in any
fact or matter affecting the DB Discussion Materials of which Deutsche Bank may become aware after the respective dates of the DB Discussion
Materials.
In preparing the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank reviewed a variety of preliminary financial and comparative matters, including those
summarized below. Deutsche Bank also considered industry performance, general financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and
circumstances existing as of dates
57
Table of Contents
proximate to the DB Discussion Materials, many of which are beyond the control of the CD&R Entities, TPG and the Company.
The estimates or results contained in the DB Discussion Materials are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the DB Discussion Materials. In addition, the results of a financial review of
the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or
acquired. Accordingly, the estimates utilized and results reflected in the DB Discussion Materials were inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
Deutsche Bank was not requested to, and it did not, recommend, determine or otherwise participate in the negotiation of the consideration payable in the
Transactions. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Transactions were determined through negotiations among the CD&R Entities and
TPG, on the one hand, and the Company, the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors), on the other hand, and the
decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was that of the parties to the Merger Agreement. The DB Discussion Materials were viewed by the CD&R
Entities and TPG as having limited relevance and were not relied on by the CD&R Entities or TPG in arriving at the decision to enter into the Merger
Agreement or the Transactions, and the DB Discussion Materials had no influence on the CD&R Entities’ and TPG’s analysis or negotiation of the
consideration payable in the Transactions or any other terms of the Transactions.
The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses and observations performed by Deutsche Bank, nor
does the order of the financial analyses or observations described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses or
observations by Deutsche Bank. Certain financial analyses and observations summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand the financial analyses and observations, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary as the tables alone do
not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses and observations. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses and observations, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the financial analyses and
observations, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses and observations. Future results may be different from those
described and such differences may be material.
Summary of the DB Discussion Materials.
The April 29 DB Discussion Materials, the May 5 DB Discussion Materials and the May 7 DB Discussion Materials were each prior iterations of the May
13 DB Discussion Materials and contain the same topics, financial analyses and observations and substantially similar information as those included in
the May 13 DB Discussion Materials. The April 29 DB Discussion Materials, and the additional information provided in the May 5 DB Discussion
Materials, the May 7 DB Discussion Materials and the May 13 DB Discussion Materials, are described below.
For purposes of the financial analyses and observations included in the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank separately considered each of the
Company’s three divisions (global pharmacy management (“GPM”), global software services (“GSS”) and animal health distribution (“Distribution”)),
without considering the Company as a whole and without taking into account certain financial data, including overhead and general and administrative
expenses, attributable to each of the Company’s three divisions or that otherwise would be taken into account when considering the Company as a
whole.
April 29 DB Discussion Materials. The April 29 DB Discussion Materials included, among other information, (i) observations on Company common
stock performance and public market perspectives, (ii) various observations regarding selected public companies and selected precedent transactions
and (iii) potential

multiples, as applicable, observed for the Selected Companies and the Selected Transactions and, in the case of the Company, primarily
utilizing the portion of the Financial Forecasts provided to the Sponsors by the Company’s management, which supported approximate
implied enterprise values for the Company’s GPM division of approximately $800 million, for the Company’s GSS division of up to
approximately $700 million and for the Company’s Distribution division of approximately $2,500 million to $3,000 million.

for the Company’s GSS division, which supported an approximate implied enterprise value for the Company’s GSS division of approximately $450 million
or $600 million, depending on whether low-growth or high-growth scenarios were assumed. The May 7 DB Discussion Materials also updated the
preliminary theoretical leveraged buyout overview of the Company’s GSS division, which indicated an approximate implied enterprise value for the
Company’s GSS division of approximately $375 million to $425 million based on mid-growth scenario assumptions.

As further described above, the CD&R Entities and TPG believe that the above analyses and observations were preliminary only and did not take into
account all relevant factors; therefore, the CD&R Entities and TPG did not consider such materials in determining an appropriate price for the
Company or any of its divisions, either in connection with the Transactions or in future possible exit scenarios. The CD&R Entities and TPG did not
rely on the DB Discussion Materials in negotiating the consideration payable in the Transactions or any other terms of the Transactions or in deciding
to enter into the Merger Agreement or the Transactions.
Miscellaneous.
CD&R and TPG have agreed to pay Deutsche Bank for its financial advisory services in connection with the Transactions an aggregate fee of $2 million
payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Deutsche Bank and/or certain of its affiliates also have participated and expect to participate
further in certain financings for the Transactions, including acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner for, and as a lender under, such financings.
CD&R and TPG currently expect that Deutsche Bank’s aggregate fees in connection with such financings will be up to approximately $9.5 million. In
addition, CD&R and TPG agreed to indemnify Deutsche Bank and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities
laws, arising from Deutsche Bank’s engagement.
Deutsche Bank and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Deutsche Bank and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any
time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments of the Company, any of its affiliates and third parties, including CD&R and TPG and any of their respective affiliates
and/or portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Transactions, including the Merger. Deutsche Bank is an affiliate
of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates, the “DB Group”). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, are currently
providing and in the future may provide, investment banking and commercial banking (including the extension of credit) services to CD&R and/or certain
of its affiliates and/or portfolio companies for which services the DB Group has received, and in the future may receive, compensation, including during
the approximately two-year period prior to May 24, 2022, having acted or acting as (i) financial advisor in connection with certain acquisition and
disposition transactions, (ii) bookrunner and/or underwriter for certain equity and debt offerings and (iii) bookrunner for, and/or as a lender under, certain
credit facilities, for which services described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) the DB Group received during such approximately two-year period
aggregate fees of approximately €50 million from CD&R and/or its affiliates and/or portfolio companies. One or more members of the DB Group also have,
from time to time, provided, are currently providing and in the future may provide, investment banking and commercial banking (including the extension
of credit) services to TPG and/or certain of its affiliates and/or portfolio companies for which services the DB Group has received, and in the future may
receive, compensation, including during the approximately two-year period prior to May 24, 2022, having acted or acting as (i) financial advisor in
connection with certain acquisition and disposition transactions, (ii) bookrunner and/or underwriter for certain equity and debt offerings and (iii)
bookrunner for, and/or as a lender under, certain credit facilities, for which services described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) the DB Group
received during such approximately two-year period aggregate fees of approximately €74 million from TPG and/or its affiliates and/or portfolio companies.
Although the DB Group did not provide investment banking or commercial banking services during the approximately two-year period prior to May 24,
2022 to the Company for which services the DB Group received or expect to receive compensation, one or more members of the DB Group may provide
such services to the Company and/or its affiliates in the future, for which services the DB Group would expect to receive compensation.

The Company’s purpose for engaging in the Merger is to enable its stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration, which represents a per share
premium of approximately (1) 37.5% above the unaffected closing price of the shares of Company common stock as of May 13, 2022 and (2) 16.5% above
the closing price of the shares of Company common stock as of May 19, 2022, the last trading day prior to the day CD&R publicly disclosed the proposal
letter in an amendment to its Schedule 13D filing with respect to the Company. The Transaction Committee and the Board believe that the Merger
provides the best opportunity to maximize stockholder value. The Company has determined to undertake the Merger at this time based on the analyses,
determinations and conclusions of the Transaction Committee and the Board described in detail above under the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Special Factors—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the Merger.”

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the CD&R Entities may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, be
required to express their reasons for the Merger to the Company’s unaffiliated stockholders, as defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act. The CD&R
Entities are making the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and the related rules
under the Exchange Act. For the CD&R Entities, the primary purpose of the Merger is to allow Parent to own equity interests in the Company and to bear
the rewards and risks of such ownership after the Merger is completed and the shares of Company common stock cease to be publicly traded. The CD&R
Entities believe that, as a private company, the Company will be able to improve its ability to execute initiatives that over time will create additional
enterprise value for the Company. The CD&R Entities believe that this, along with the Company’s existing business and potential future opportunities,
will allow the CD&R Entities’ investment in the Company to achieve longer term returns consistent with its investment objectives, which are in some
cases more difficult for businesses to achieve as a public company due to the investment community’s focus on short-term, often quarterly, financial
results. Further, absent the reporting and associated costs and burdens placed on public companies, the CD&R Entities believe that the management and
employees of Covetrus will be able to execute more effectively on future strategic plans. The CD&R Entities have undertaken to pursue the Merger at this
time for the reasons described above, as well as due to the CD&R Entities desire to maximize long-term investment returns for their partners, following the
decision by the Board and the Transaction Committee to conduct a review of strategic alternatives available to the Company that culminated in CD&R
and TPG being invited to submit an offer for the acquisition of the Company. The CD&R Entities believe that structuring the transaction as a merger is
preferable to other transaction structures because it (1) will enable Parent to acquire all of the shares of Company common stock at the same time, (2) will
allow the Company to cease to be a publicly registered and reporting company, and (3) represents an opportunity for the Company’s unaffiliated
stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

Following completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a
subsidiary of Parent. The shares of Company common stock are currently listed on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act. Following
completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the shares of Company common stock and, as soon as possible following the Effective Time,
Company common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ, deregistered under the Exchange Act and cease to be publicly traded.
Given CD&R VFC Holdings’ long-standing ownership stake in the Company, the CD&R Entities currently anticipate that the Company’s strategy and
operations will initially be conducted following completion of the Merger substantially as they are currently being conducted (except that the Company
will cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent). Following completion of the Merger, the
67Table of Contents
CD&R Entities, together with TPG, will continue to assess the Company’s assets, corporate and capital structure, capitalization, operations, business,
properties and personnel to determine what additional changes, if any, would be desirable to enhance the business and operations of the Company.
The names of the persons expected to become the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time will be added to this proxy
statement prior to its mailing. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are expected to be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company.
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our
directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Covetrus stockholders generally. The
Transaction Committee and the Board were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the Merger Agreement and
recommended that Covetrus’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
In addition to the matters described below, two directors, Sandra Peterson (an Operating Partner at CD&R) and Ravi Sachdev (a Partner at CD&R), were
designated by CD&R VFC Holdings as directors on the Board (and they recused themselves from deliberations regarding the Merger due to their
affiliation with CD&R).
Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides for the acceleration and cash-out of all outstanding equity awards upon the consummation of the Merger, including
those held by our executive officers and directors.
The Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time each outstanding equity award will be treated as follows:
Treatment of Stock Options.
Outstanding options to purchase shares of Company common stock (other than rights to purchase shares of Company common stock under the ESPP
(described below)) (each, an “Option”) granted under the Company’s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, whether vested or unvested, will be
treated as follows: (i) if the per share of Company common stock exercise price of such Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Option will terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have
no further force or effect and (ii) if the per share of Company common stock exercise price of such Option is less than the Merger Consideration, such
Option will terminate and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash
payment in the amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company common stock underlying the Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (y) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price (the product of (x) and (y), the “Option Payment”).
From and after the Effective Time, each Option will no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but will only entitle such holder to the Option
Payment, if any. The Option Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar
days thereafter), net of any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Treatment of Restricted Stock Units.
Outstanding restricted stock units that are subject to time-based vesting conditions (a “Restricted Stock Unit” or “RSU”), granted under the Company’s
2019 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan that are outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested will
fully vest (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Restricted Stock Unit would not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be
68
Table of Contents
automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount equal to
(i) the number of shares of Company common stock underlying such Restricted Stock Unit, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (the product of (i)
and (ii), the “Restricted Stock Unit Payment”). From and after the Effective Time, no Restricted Stock Unit will remain outstanding and each former holder
of any such Restricted Stock Unit will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted Stock Unit Payment. The
Restricted Stock Unit Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days
thereafter), net of any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Treatment of Performance Restricted Stock Units.
Outstanding performance restricted stock units that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions (a “Performance Restricted Stock Unit” or
“PRSU”) granted under the Company’s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan that are outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Performance Restricted Stock Unit
would not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to
receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Performance Restricted
Stock Unit that would vest based on the target level of achievement (provided that in no event will such number of shares of Company common stock
exceed 990,000), multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (the product of (i) and (ii), the “Performance Restricted Stock Unit Payment”). From and after
the Effective Time, no Performance Restricted Stock Unit will remain outstanding and each former holder of any such Performance Restricted Stock Unit
will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Performance Restricted Stock Unit Payment. The Performance Restricted
Stock Unit Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), net
of any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Treatment of Company Restricted Stock.
At the Effective Time, each share of Company common stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will fully vest and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive Merger Consideration and be treated in the same
manner as all other shares of Company common stock for such purposes.
Treatment of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
The Company has agreed to take all actions necessary to terminate the ESPP and all outstanding rights thereunder as of the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”). The offering or purchase period under the ESPP that would
be in effect as of the Effective Time (the “Final Offering Period”) will terminate no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the
Company has agreed to cause the exercise date applicable to the Final Offering Period to accelerate and occur on the termination date of the ESPP with
respect to any then-outstanding purchase rights. All amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the ESPP at the end of the Final Offering
Period will thereupon be used to purchase whole shares of Company common stock under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which shares of
Company common stock will be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the same manner as all
other shares of Company common stock. Following the purchase of the shares of Company common stock, the Company will return to each participant
the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase. The Company has agreed to take such steps as may be necessary such
that, between the date of the signing of the Merger Agreement and the Closing, (i) no new participants may commence participation in the ESPP, (ii) no
current participant in the ESPP may increase his or her rate of contribution under the ESPP and (iii) no new offering period will commence after the date the
Merger Agreement was signed.

The following table sets forth the number of shares of Company common stock underlying outstanding RSUs, PRSUs and Options that would be held by
our executive officers as of September 15, 2022 assuming the Merger closes on such date (solely for the purposes of the table below) (taking into account
any vesting of their outstanding awards that occurs prior to such date) and the cash proceeds that such awards will be converted into in connection with
the Merger, assuming a price per share of $21.00, which is the price per share of Company common stock to be paid in connection with the Merger. All
share numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

This amount does not include 23,624 Options with an exercise price of $37.47 as such exercise price exceeds the Merger Consideration of $21.00 per
share.
The following sets forth the number of shares of Company common stock underlying outstanding RSUs and Options that would be held by our non-
employee directors as of September 15, 2022 assuming the Merger closes on such date (solely for the purposes of this paragraph) (taking into account
any vesting of their outstanding awards that occurs prior to such date) and the unvested cash proceeds that such unvested awards will be converted
into in connection with the Merger, assuming a price per share of $21.00, which is the price per share of Company common stock to be paid in connection
with the Merger. All share numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole number. For Deborah G. Ellinger, 14,638 RSUs totaling $307,398; for Paul
Fonteyne, 14,638 RSUs totaling $307,398; for Sandra L. Helton, 14,638 RSUs totaling $307,398; for Philip A. Laskawy, 38,727 RSUs totaling $813,267; for
Mark J. Manoff, 14,638 RSUs totaling $307,398; for Edward M. McNamara, 14,638 RSUs and 77,435 Options totaling $1,329,366; for Steven Paladino,
14,638 RSUs totaling $307,398; for Sandra Peterson 14,638 RSUs totaling $307,398; for Ravi Sachdev, 14,638 RSUs totaling $307,398; and for Sharon
Wienbar, 46,445 RSUs totaling $975,345.
Employment Agreements
Each of our named executive officers is a party to an employment agreement with the Company which provide for enhanced severance payments and
benefits upon a termination of their employment by the Company without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason” within a specified time
period of a “change in control,” which would include the Merger (a “Qualifying Termination”). For Benjamin Wolin, such period commences three months
prior to and ends 24 months following the consummation of the change in control. For Dustin Finer, Georgina Wraight, Matthew Malenfant and Matthew
Foulston, such period commences two months prior (or the earlier date of execution of a definitive agreement to effectuate a change in control) and ends
12 months following the consummation of the change in control.
For each named executive officer, assuming their employment was terminated as a Qualifying Termination, the total severance payments would be as
follows: (i) for Benjamin Wolin, a lump sum payment equal to eighteen (18) months of base salary in the amount of $1,575,000 plus his target pro-rated
annual bonus for 2022 in the amount of $656,250 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $45,980; (ii) for Matthew
Foulston, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $600,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 payable in equal installments
over the twelve (12) month
70
Table of Contents
period following the termination in the amount of $540,000 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $32,667; (iii) for
Matthew Malenfant, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $575,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 payable in equal
installments over the twelve (12) month period following the termination in the amount of $460,000 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance
coverage in the amount of $47,108; (iv) for Georgina Wraight, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $550,000 plus her target
annual bonus for 2022 payable in equal installments over the twelve (12) month period following the termination in the amount of $412,500 and twelve (12)
months of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $31,813; and (v) for Dustin Finer, a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of base salary
in the amount of $480,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 in the amount of $360,000 and twelve (12) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the
amount of $31,813.
In addition, upon a Qualifying Termination, all equity awards held by the executive officers that are subject to time-based vesting would become fully
vested, and any equity awards that are subject to performance-based vesting will vest based on the “target” level of performance (for Benjamin Wolin) or
based on the greater of “target” or “actual” performance at the time of termination (for Georgina Wraight, Matthew Foulston, Matthew Malenfant and
Dustin Finer) in accordance with the relevant award agreements.
On August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Foulston Amendment”) to Mr. Foulston’s employment agreement, dated as of May 11,
2020, in order to retain Mr. Foulston’s services through December 31, 2022 (the “Expiration Date”). The Foulston Amendment provides for, among other
terms: (i) the vesting of outstanding equity grants held by Mr. Foulston on the earlier of the Expiration Date and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) the payment of Mr. Foulston’s annual bonus at an amount equal to the greater of Mr. Foulston’s 2022 target
bonus and the amount earned based on the actual achievement of performance goals under the Company’s 2022 annual bonus plan; (iii) severance of
$2,020,000 paid over twelve months following the Expiration Date; (iv) eighteen-months COBRA continuation; and (v) the payment of his base salary
through the Expiration Date if his employment is terminated prior to the Expiration Date. In the event that Mr. Foulston’s employment is terminated prior
to the Expiration Date, either by the Company without “cause,” by Mr. Foulston for “good reason” or by reason of death or “disability” (each as defined
in the Foulston Amendment), Mr. Foulston will continue to be entitled to the payments and benefits described above, as well as payment of his base
salary and provision of health benefits through the Expiration Date.
On June 23, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to Mr. Finer’s employment agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, in order to clarify that
Mr. Finer will continue to be an employee of the Company on unpaid leave from August 16, 2022 through the earlier of the consummation of the Merger
and December 31, 2022 (at which time his employment will terminate) and that Mr. Finer, will be entitled to receive certain benefits upon the consummation
of the Merger, including the vesting of all vested and unvested outstanding equity grants.
New Management Arrangements
It is expected that the Company and CD&R and TPG will work together to develop a new long-term incentive plan for the Company to be implemented
following the closing, and representatives of CD&R and TPG have held and may hold further preliminary discussions with certain members of the
Company’s management team regarding employment with, and the right to purchase (including by reinvesting all or a portion of their existing equity in
the Company) or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. However, as of the date of this proxy statement, neither the Company
nor Parent or any of its affiliates has entered into any agreements, arrangements or understandings with the Company’s executive officers with respect to
the foregoing, and there can be no assurances that the terms of any such agreements, arrangements or understandings will be agreed upon with any
executive officers in the future. If Parent or its affiliates and the Company’s executive officers do not enter into agreements regarding employment with
Parent or its affiliates, then the Company’s executive officers will remain subject to their existing arrangements with the Company.

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the tables below present the estimated amounts of compensation that each named executive officer
could receive that are based on or otherwise related to the Merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the
applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section, we use such term to describe the Merger-related compensation payable to the Company’s named
executive officers. This Merger-related compensation is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of Covetrus’ stockholders. See the section entitled
“Proposal 2: Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,” on page 125.
The amounts set forth below have been calculated assuming the Merger is consummated on September 15, 2022 (solely for the purposes of the table
below), and, where applicable, assuming each named executive officer experiences a Qualifying Termination of their employment as of September 15, 2022
(solely for the purposes of the table below). The amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive
officers, and the estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur. The amounts below are based on a price per share of
Company common stock of $21.00, which is the price per share of Company common stock to be paid in connection with the Merger. Some of the
assumptions are based on information not currently available, and as a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may
differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts set forth below have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

Our directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the shares of Company
common stock owned directly by them in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Merger-Related Compensation
Proposal. As of September 7, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 872,688
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, or collectively approximately 0.6% of all the outstanding shares of Company
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, determined as of the Effective Time (the
“Indemnified Parties”) against any and all costs (including settlement costs) or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger Agreement
and the Transactions)), arising out of or based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or
is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person prior to the Effective Time, in each case,
whether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company
would have been permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such person is a party, the
Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement to indemnify such person (and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced will provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to
indemnification). Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries, will, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable, in the aggregate, with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its
subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational and governing documents
of any subsidiary). The right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to the Merger Agreement will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to,
obtain and fully pay for “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions);
provided, however that in no event will the Company be required to expend for such policies an annual premium in excess of three- hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such “tail” insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or the
Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period
73Table of Contents
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement;
provided, however that in no event will the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual
premium amount in excess of three- hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, provided,
further that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Certain Effects of the Merger
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved by the Company stockholders, and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Covetrus upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.
As the Surviving Corporation, Covetrus will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Following the Merger, all of Covetrus’ equity interests will be legally and beneficially owned by Parent, and none of Covetrus’ current stockholders will,
by virtue of the Merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the surviving corporation or Parent after the completion of the Merger
(except CD&R VFC Holdings will have an indirect ownership interest in Covetrus as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Support and
Rollover Agreement). As a result, Covetrus’ current stockholders (other than CD&R VFC Holdings) will no longer benefit from any increase in the value,
nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Company common stock. Following the Merger, Parent will benefit from any increase in
Covetrus’ enterprise value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in Covetrus’ enterprise value.
For information regarding the effects of the Merger on Covetrus’ outstanding equity awards, see the sections entitled “Special Factors—Interests of
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 68, and “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards;
Company ESPP,” beginning on page 86.
Company common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on NASDAQ under the symbol “CVET.” Following the completion of
the Merger, the shares of Company common stock will no longer be traded on NASDAQ or any other public market. In addition, the registration of the
shares of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Covetrus will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports
with the SEC with respect to Company common stock. Termination of registration of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the
information required to be furnished by Covetrus to Covetrus’ stockholders and the SEC, and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such
as the requirement to file annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a)
of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Covetrus to the extent that they apply solely as a result of the registration of Company common stock under
the Exchange Act.
The primary detriments of the Merger to stockholders unaffiliated with Parent, CD&R and TPG include the lack of an interest of such stockholders in the
potential future earnings, growth or value realized by the Company after the Merger.
Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not
receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for your shares of Company common stock. Instead, Covetrus will remain a public company, and the
Company common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar
to that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of Company common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and
opportunities as they currently are subject to with
74
Table of Contents
respect to their ownership of Company common stock. If the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of Company common stock, including the risk that the market price of Company common stock may decline to the extent
that the current market price of Company common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement
Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any
other transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, (i) Covetrus may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of
$88,315,000 or (ii) Parent may be required to pay Covetrus a termination fee of $197,950,000. For additional information, see the section entitled “The

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the disposition of Company common stock for cash in the Merger
to “U.S. Holders” (as defined below). This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal
income taxation that might be relevant to U.S. Holders. This summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(which we refer to as the “Code”), existing, proposed and temporary regulations thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof in
effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
(which we refer to as the “IRS”) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be
given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS.
The summary applies only to U.S Holders in whose hands shares of Company common stock are capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code. This summary does not address foreign, state or local tax consequences of the Merger, nor does it address the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the transactions to special classes of taxpayers (e.g., stockholders that beneficially own (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the
total fair market value of the shares of Company common stock, small business investment companies, S corporations, regulated investment companies,
real estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, qualified foreign pension funds or qualified
collective investment vehicles, persons that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, cooperatives, banks and certain other financial
institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, governmental organizations, retirement plans, stockholders that are, or hold
shares of Company common stock through, partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, stockholders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar, dealers in securities or foreign currency, traders that mark-to-market
their securities, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, stockholders holding shares of Company common stock that are part of a
straddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated security transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, stockholders who properly
exercise appraisal rights with respect to their shares of Company common stock, stockholders who hold their shares of Company common stock as
“qualified small business stock” or “section 1244 stock,” stockholders who received shares of Company common stock in compensatory transactions
(including pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options, stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights, as restricted stock or otherwise as
compensation), stockholders who are not exchanging shares of Covetrus shares for cash, and stockholders who
75
Table of Contents
actually or constructively own an interest in Parent). In addition, this summary does not address U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (including any
U.S. federal estate or gift tax consequences), or any aspect of the U.S. alternative minimum tax or Medicare tax on net investment income.
If a partnership, or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of the Company common
stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of its partners or members generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the
partnership’s activities. Accordingly, partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes that hold shares of
Company common stock, and partners or members in those entities, are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax
consequences to them of the Merger.
This discussion does not address the tax consequences of acquisitions or dispositions of shares of Company common stock outside the Merger, or
transactions pertaining to options or other equity awards of the Company in connection with the Merger.
For purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, is or is treated as: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust, if (A) a United States court is able to exercise primary
supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have authority
to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO U.S.
HOLDERS. WE URGE U.S. HOLDERS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO
THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT
AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER APPLICABLE U.S. TAX TREATIES AND STATE, LOCAL
OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.
Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S.
Holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to
the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of
cash received and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company common stock surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Gain or
loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company common stock (that is, shares of Company common stock acquired at the same
cost in a single transaction) surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss would be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the
holding period for such block of shares of Company common stock is more than one year at the time of consummation of the Merger. Long-term capital
gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital
losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to certain limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds received by a holder
pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies
under penalty of perjury that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the Required Information is timely furnished to the IRS.

The tax discussion set forth above is included for general information only and is not tax advice. You are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine
the particular tax consequences to you of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws and
treaties.
Treatment of Existing Debt
The Company has agreed to (a) obtain the Debt Payoff Letter at least one (1) business day prior to the closing date of the Merger, guarantee terminations
and lien terminations, if applicable, to the extent necessary for the termination of all guarantees granted in connection with, the release of all liens related
to, and the prepayment, payoff, discharge and termination in full of all obligations outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, (b) provide Parent
with a draft copy of such Debt Payoff Letter at least three (3) business days prior to the closing date of the Merger and (c) give (by the date required
under the Existing Credit Agreement) any necessary notices (including notices of prepayment) to allow for the prepayment, payoff, discharge and
termination in full of the Existing Credit Agreement at the Closing.
Regulatory Approvals
Under the Merger Agreement, completion of the Merger is conditioned on the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the completion
of the Merger under the HSR Act.
On June 8, 2022, Covetrus and Parent filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger with the FTC and
the DOJ, which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. The HSR Act waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. EST on July 8, 2022.
Completion of the Merger is further subject to the receipt of antitrust and/or foreign investment approvals and/or clearances in China, South Korea,
Turkey, the European Union and Australia, as well as consents from certain state boards of pharmacy, with such approvals and/or clearances having been
received from South Korea (on July 8, 2022), Turkey (on July 7, 2022), the European Union (on July 20, 2022), China (on August 5, 2022) and Australia (on
September 9, 2022).
At any time before or after the Merger is completed, the FTC, the DOJ, U.S. state attorneys general as well as non-U.S. regulatory bodies could take
action under antitrust laws and/or foreign investment laws in opposition to the Merger, including seeking to enjoin completion of the Merger, condition
adoption of the Merger Agreement upon the divestiture of assets of Parent, Covetrus or their respective subsidiaries or impose restrictions on Parent’s
post-Merger operations or other conditions. In addition, state boards of pharmacy could decide to not issue required consents for the Transactions.
Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the U.S. federal or state antitrust laws under some circumstances.
For a description of Covetrus’ and Parent’s respective obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to regulatory approvals, see the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Complete the Merger,” beginning on page 97.

As of September 11, 2022 six Actions have been filed in the S.D.N.Y. in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement: Shiva
Stein v. Covetrus, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-05737 (S.D.N.Y., filed July 6, 2022); Ryan O’Dell v. Covetrus, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-05803 (S.D.N.Y.,

and Chris Rayfield v. Covetrus, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-06298 (S.D.N.Y, filed July 25, 2022). Each of the Actions names Covetrus and its directors as
defendants. The Actions assert claims under Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule
77Table of Contents
14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and allege that the Proxy Statement filed by Covetrus with the Securities Exchange Commission on June 30,
2022 in connection with the Merger contains alleged material misstatements or omissions. The Actions seek, among other things, to enjoin the
defendants from proceeding with, consummating or closing the Merger, rescisissory damages should the Merger not be enjoined, and an award of
attorneys’ and experts’ fees. The defendants believe that the allegations in the Actions are without merit. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent
new or different allegations that are material, Covetrus will not necessarily announce such filings.

The Merger Agreement does not contain any financing condition to consummation of the Merger. Parent estimates that the total funds necessary to
complete the Merger and pay the Merger Consideration will be approximately $4.2 billion, including estimated transaction fees and expenses and the
shares of Company common stock held by CD&R VFC Holdings valued at $21.00 per share. Parent expects these amounts to be funded through a
combination of committed debt financing from specified lenders, consisting of an up to $1,525,000,000 first lien secured term loan facility, an up to
$425,000,000 second lien secured term loan facility, and an up to $300,000,000 first lien secured cash-flow based revolving credit facility (up to $65,000,000
of which will be available at the Closing to finance the Transactions and pay related fees and expenses), and $1,604,000,000 from equity commitments by
the Equity Investors.
Equity Financing
In connection with the Merger, Parent delivered to the Company (i) an equity commitment letter between Parent and CD&R Fund XI, pursuant to which
CD&R Fund XI has committed, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, to contribute, or cause to be contributed, to Parent (directly, or
indirectly through one or more parent companies of Parent, or otherwise) an aggregate amount, in immediately available funds, of $802,160,400 on or prior
to the closing of the Merger in connection with the funding of the Merger (the “CD&R Equity Financing”), (ii) an equity commitment letter between
Parent and TPG VIII, pursuant to which TPG VIII has committed, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, to contribute, or cause to be
contributed, to Parent (directly, or indirectly through one or more parent companies of Parent, or otherwise) an aggregate amount, in immediately available
funds, of $526,839,600 on or prior to the closing of the Merger in connection with the funding of the Merger (the “TPG VIII Equity Financing”) and (iii) an
equity commitment letter between Parent and TPG Healthcare, pursuant to which TPG Healthcare has committed, subject to the terms and conditions
contained therein, to contribute, or cause to be contributed, to Parent (directly, or indirectly through one or more parent companies of Parent, or
otherwise) an aggregate amount, in immediately available funds, of $275,000,000 on or prior to the closing of the Merger in connection with the funding of
the Merger (the “TPG Healthcare Equity Financing”, and together with the CD&R Equity Financing and TPG VIII Equity Financing, the “Equity
Financing”).
The obligation of the Equity Investors to provide the Equity Financing is subject to a number of conditions, including (1) the satisfaction or waiver by
Parent and Merger Sub of each of the conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing set forth in Article 7 of the Merger
Agreement (in each case, other than any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the prior or substantially
concurrent satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) and (2) the substantially contemporaneous, or prior, funding
79Table of Contents
of the debt financing contemplated by the Original Debt Commitment Letter (or, if applicable, any alternative financing, as described in the commitment
letters for the Equity Financing) at the Closing (in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Original Debt Commitment Letter).
The Equity Investors’ obligations to fund the Equity Financing and all of its obligations under each of the Equity Commitment Letters will terminate
automatically and immediately upon the earliest to occur of (1) the Closing and funding of the Equity Financing, to the extent required by the Equity
Commitment Letters, (2) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to certain exceptions, (3) the Company or any of
its controlled affiliates accepting all or any portion of the termination fee of $197,950,000 payable by Parent in certain circumstances pursuant to the
Merger Agreement or accepting any payment from the Equity Investors under the limited guarantees that each Equity Investor provided in respect of
such obligations, (4) the Company or any of its controlled affiliates asserting in writing a claim against any Equity Investor or any non-recourse party in
connection with any limited guarantee or the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, and (5) the termination of any of the other Equity
Commitment Letters entered into by the other Equity Investors.
The Company is an express third-party beneficiary only for the purpose of obtaining specific performance of Parent’s right to cause the equity financing
to be funded by the Equity Investors to Parent, subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters and the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing
Parent and Merger Sub have obtained debt financing commitments consisting of an up to $1,525,000,000 first lien secured term loan facility, an up to
$425,000,000 second lien secured term loan facility, and an up to $300,000,000 first lien secured cash-flow based revolving credit facility (up to $65,000,000
of which will be available at the Closing to finance the Transactions and pay related fees and expenses), the proceeds of which will be used to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including paying a portion of the Merger Consideration, and
paying all fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or CD&R (the “Required Amounts”). Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, UBS AG,
Stamford Branch, Bank of Montreal and Mizuho Bank Ltd. (the “Original Debt Commitment Parties”) have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub,
severally, but not jointly, with debt financing in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and related transactions, in the amounts and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Original Debt Commitment Letter.
Subsequent to the entry into the Original Debt Commitment Letter on May 24, 2022, (i) on June 15, 2022, Parent entered into a joinder to add The Toronto-
Dominion Bank, New York Branch, Santander Bank, N.A. and ING Capital LLC (the “Joining Debt Commitment Parties”) as additional financing sources
under the Original Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) on June 30, 2022, Parent entered into a second lien debt commitment letter with Owl Rock Capital
Advisors LLC and Owl Rock Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Second Lien Lender” and, together with the Original Debt Commitment Parties and the
Joining Debt Commitment Parties, the “Debt Commitment Parties”) (the “Second Lien Debt Commitment Letter” and, together with the Original Debt
Commitment Letter, the “Debt Commitment Letters”), pursuant to which the Second Lien Lender committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with
alternate second lien debt financing in the amounts and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. The obligations of the Debt
Commitment Parties to provide the debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letters are subject to certain customary conditions.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
the financing on terms (including the “market flex” provisions) and conditions no less favorable to Parent than those described in the Equity Commitment
Letters and the Original Debt Commitment Letter, subject to the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement).
The Company has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to use

reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to
you. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.
The Merger Agreement is described in this proxy statement and included as Annex A only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding Covetrus, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Such information
can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement or, in the case of Covetrus, in the public filings that Covetrus makes with the SEC, which are available
without charge through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 144.
The representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by Covetrus, Parent and Merger Sub are qualified and subject to
important limitations agreed to by Covetrus, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular, in
your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that
the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger
Agreement may have the right not to close the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in
circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some
cases were qualified by disclosures that were made by Covetrus and Parent, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. Moreover,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy
statement, may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or
warranty may have been included in this proxy statement.
The Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Covetrus
and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. Covetrus will be the Surviving Corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, and the separate corporate existence of Covetrus with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises will continue unaffected by the
Merger, except as set forth in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Organizational Documents; Directors and Officers” below. The Merger will
have the effects specified in the DGCL.
Effective Time of the Merger
Unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Closing will take place as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no
event later than three (3) business days, following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of each of the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement is satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions); provided, that if the Marketing Period (as described in “The Merger Agreement—Marketing Period”) has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing), the Closing will instead occur on the date that is the earlier to occur of (a) any business day during the Marketing Period specified by
Parent to the Company on no less than two (2) business days’ notice (unless a shorter period
82Table of Contents
is agreed to by Parent and the Company) and (b) the third (3rd) business day after the final day of the Marketing Period. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date.”
Concurrently with the Closing, Covetrus and Parent will cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Effective Time of the Merger will be
on the date and time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date or time as
otherwise agreed to by the Covetrus and Parent in writing and set forth in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

The “Marketing Period”, a time allotted to Parent and Merger Sub for purposes of marketing the debt financing, will be (A) through and including January
9, 2023, the first period of fifteen (15) consecutive business days after the date of the Merger Agreement throughout and at the end of which (1) Parent
will have the Required Information (as described below) at such time and for the three (3) business days thereafter and (2) the conditions to the Merger
for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived (other than any such conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of such conditions to fail to be
satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such fifteen (15) consecutive business day period or (B) if the Extension Trigger

has occurred and the Marketing Period has not then fully elapsed pursuant to clause (A), at all times from and after January 10, 2023, the first period of
fifteen (15) consecutive business days after the date of the Merger Agreement throughout and at the end of which Parent will have the Required
Information at such time and for the three (3) business days thereafter; provided, that, solely in the case of clause (A), (I) if such fifteen (15) consecutive

consecutive business day period will not commence prior to January 3, 2023.
Further, solely to the extent the Marketing Period is determined in accordance with clause (A) of the preceding paragraph, the Marketing Period will not
be deemed to have commenced if (x) the Company’s auditor has withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the audited financial statements of the
Company that are included in the Required Information, (y) the Company restates, or the Board has determined to restate or the Company’s auditor has
determined that it is necessary to restate any historical financial statements of the Company that are included in the Required Information or the Company
has determined that a restatement of any such historical financial statements is required or (z) the Required Information, taken as a whole, contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact, in each case with respect to the Company, necessary in order to make the statements
contained in the Required Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading. If the Company in good faith
reasonably believes that it has delivered the Required Information and that the Marketing Period has commenced, it is entitled to deliver to Parent a
written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery and when it believes such period has commenced), in which case, subject
to clauses (x) through (z) above, the Marketing Period will be deemed to have commenced on the first business day immediately following such notice
unless Parent, in good faith, believes the Marketing Period has not commenced (including as a result of the occurrence of an event described in clauses
(x) through (z) above) and within three (3) business days after the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to
that effect (setting forth with reasonable specific detail why Parent believes the Marketing Period has not commenced). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Marketing Period shall be deemed to be completed if the debt financing has been fully allocated in the primary syndication thereof prior to the

terminate and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment in the
amount equal to the Option Payment. From and after the Effective Time, each Option will no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but will

event not later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), net of any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

otherwise vest) and will terminate and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the
Restricted Stock Unit Payment. From and after the Effective Time, no Restricted Stock Unit will remain outstanding and each former holder of any such
Restricted Stock Unit will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted Stock Unit Payment. The Restricted
Stock Unit Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), net
of any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

The Final Offering Period will terminate no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Company has agreed to cause the exercise
date applicable to the Final Offering Period to accelerate and occur on the termination date of the ESPP with respect to any then-outstanding purchase

whole shares of Company common stock under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which shares of Company common stock will be cancelled
at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the same manner as all other shares of Company common stock.
Following the purchase of the shares of Company common stock, the Company will return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such

the Merger Agreement and the Closing, (i) no new participants may commence participation in the ESPP, (ii) no current participant in the ESPP may
increase his or her rate of contribution under the ESPP and (iii) no new offering period will commence after the date the Merger Agreement was signed.

certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the certificates). Upon the surrender of a certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the certificate) to the Paying
Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for such certificate
an amount in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required tax
withholding) equal to the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive as the Merger Consideration, and the certificate so surrendered will be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable to holders of certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company common stock represented by a certificate that is not registered in the transfer records of Covetrus, a check for any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the certificate may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the certificate representing such shares of Company common stock is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, reasonably acceptable to Parent.

assets, properties, books or records, other information or employees or other representatives of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in

The Company has agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries and direct its representatives to, immediately (i) cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives) conducted prior and up to the date of the
Merger Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and cease
providing any information to any such person or its representatives, (ii) with respect to any person with whom such discussions or negotiations have
been terminated, promptly following the date of the Merger Agreement (and in any event within two (2) business days of the date of the Merger

any information furnished by or on behalf of the Company and take all necessary action to secure its rights and ensure the performance of any such
person’s obligations under any applicable confidentiality agreement, (3) promptly terminate all access granted to any person and its representatives to

informing any person that makes an Acquisition Proposal of the restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement.
Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement described above, prior to the time, but not after, the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal received after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from the Company’s breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger
Agreement described above, (i) provide access to non-public information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the person who made such
Acquisition Proposal; provided that such information has previously been made available to Parent or is provided to Parent promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) following the time such information is made available to such person and that, prior to furnishing any such non-public
information, the Company receives from the person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as
restrictive in all material respects on such person as the confidentiality agreement’s terms are (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement
need not prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such
person regarding such Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, (1) the Board (acting on the
recommendation of the
94
Table of Contents
Transaction Committee) determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) based on the information then available and after
consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law and (2) with respect to clause (ii) above, the Company
provides written notice to Parent at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to engaging or participating in any discussions or negotiations with any such
person regarding such Acquisition Proposal.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if (i) any written or other
bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or that could be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
are received by the Company, (ii) any non-public information is requested in connection with any bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or that could be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or that could be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with
the Company, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers
(including providing copies of any written materials delivered by such Person) and thereafter will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of
the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any material amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations
(including delivery to Parent within twenty-four (24) hours of copies of all communications delivered by or on behalf of such person in connection with
such proposal or offer).
“Superior Proposal” means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal made by a third party (and not made as a result of a breach by the Company in any
material respect of non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement) after the date of the Merger Agreement, which the Board (acting on the
recommendation of the Transaction Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) to be (i)
more favorable to the holders of shares of Company common stock from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and
conditions (including any financing condition or the reliability of any debt or equity funding commitments (including whether fully committed)) of, the
identity of the third party making, and the likelihood of completion of, such Acquisition Proposal and the Merger Agreement (including, if applicable at
the time of such determination, any changes to the financial terms of the Merger Agreement then proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise)), and (ii) reasonably likely to be capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal; provided that, for purposes of this definition of “Superior Proposal” only, references to fifteen percent (15%) in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal will be deemed to be references to seventy-five percent (75%).
No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement
The Merger Agreement provides that, except as described below, neither the Board nor any committee thereof will (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board to the
Company’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) fail to
include the recommendation of the Board to the Company’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement in this proxy statement, (iii) after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, fail to recommend against such Acquisition Proposal and, after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, reaffirm the recommendation
of the Board to the Company’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement within ten (10) days of receipt of a written request from Parent to do so (and
if the Company stockholders meeting for adopting the Merger Agreement is scheduled to be held within ten (10) days, then within two (2) business days
of such request), (iv) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (v) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (as
defined below) (each of
95
Table of Contents
the foregoing clauses (i)-(v), a “Change in Recommendation”) or (vi) cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement or other agreement (other than
a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement) (an “Alternative Acquisition
Agreement”) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.
Superior Proposal Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
Following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a breach by the
Company in any material respect of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and that the Board (acting on the recommendation of the
Transaction Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) may, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
Company’s stockholders, make a Change in Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its termination provisions in order to
enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any
such action, if all of the following conditions are met:
•
the Company has (A) provided to Parent four (4) business days’ prior written notice, which will state expressly (1) that it has received a
written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
(including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the person or group making the Acquisition Proposal) and will have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents (other than immaterial
documents) related to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term or condition of such Superior Proposal will require a new notice and an additional two (2) business day period) and (3) that,
subject to the next bullet, the Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) has determined to make a Change in
Recommendation or to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable and (B)
prior to making such a Change in Recommendation or terminating the Merger Agreement, as applicable, used commercially reasonable
efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such notice period, to consider any adjustments
proposed in writing by Parent to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement such that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and
•
the Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms proposed in writing
by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation
or to so terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law.
Intervening Event Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the provision restricting Changes in Recommendation or the Company entering into Alternative
Acquisition Agreements in the Merger Agreement, upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event (as defined below), the Board may, at any time prior to
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders, make a Change in Recommendation, if all of the following conditions are met:
•
the Company has (A) provided to Parent four (4) business days’ prior written notice, which will (1) set forth in reasonable detail information
describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Change
96
Table of Contents
in Recommendation and (2) state expressly that, subject to the next bullet, the Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction
Committee) has determined to make a Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Change in Recommendation, used
reasonable best efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such four (4) business day notice
period to consider any adjustments proposed in writing by Parent to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement such that the
failure of the Board to make a Change in Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with the next bullet would no
longer reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
•
the Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed in writing by Parent, the
failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
“Intervening Event” means a material effect that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the execution of the Merger
Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which effect, or any
material consequence thereof, becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
Company’s stockholders; provided, that “Intervening Event” will exclude any event, circumstance, change or development (A) related to any Acquisition
Proposal or other inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any matter related thereto or to the
consequences thereof, (B) related to changes in the price or trading volume of the shares of Company common stock, in and of itself (however, the
underlying facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such change or event may be taken into account when determining whether an Intervening
Event has occurred unless excluded by any other exclusion in this definition), or (C) related to the fact that, in and of itself, the Company exceeds (or fails
to meet) any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of the Company’s revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of
operations for any period, in and of itself (provided, that the underlying facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such for the Company
exceeding such projections, estimates or expectations may be taken into account when determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred unless
excluded by any other exclusion in this definition).
Obligations with Respect to this Proxy Statement, Schedule 13e-3 and the Special Meeting
As promptly as possible, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the date of the Merger Agreement, Covetrus was required to prepare and file this
proxy statement in preliminary form. The Company and Parent were also each required to use their reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses
to the SEC with respect to any comments received on the proxy statement by the SEC. The Company was required to cause the definitive proxy statement
to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the staff of the SEC advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the proxy statement.
The Company and the CD&R Entities has, concurrently with preparation and filing of this proxy statement, jointly prepared and filed with the SEC a Rule
13e-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13e-3 relating to the Transactions.
Covetrus is required, in coordination with the CD&R Entities, as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with applicable law and the Company’s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and use its reasonable best efforts to convene a meeting
of the holders of Company common stock to consider and vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Efforts to Complete the Merger
Covetrus and Parent will, subject to the exceptions to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement described above, cooperate with each
other and use, and will cause their respective subsidiaries and
97
Table of Contents
controlled affiliates to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things
necessary, proper or advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
Transactions as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than November 24, 2022 (the “Termination Date”) including (i) preparing and filing all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings (and in any event, by filing within ten (10) business days after the date of the
Merger Agreement the notifications, filings and other information required to be filed under the HSR Act, and as promptly as practicable in the case of all
other filings required under any other antitrust laws or laws relating to foreign investment with respect to the Transactions) and to obtain as expeditiously
as possible all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from
any third party or any governmental entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) satisfying the conditions to
consummating the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the Merger Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger, (iv) obtaining (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any exemption by,
any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Merger and (v) executing and
delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of the Merger
Agreement.
Subject to the following paragraph, in the event that Covetrus and Parent receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR
Act or any other antitrust laws or laws relating to foreign investment, including a request for additional information and documentary material, unless
otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company, Covetrus and Parent will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and to
certify compliance with, such request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such
request review process. None of the parties, including their respective subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, will take, cause or permit to be taken, or omit
to take, any action which such party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the contemplated transactions, unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties.
In furtherance of the foregoing, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, neither CD&R nor TPG (solely with respect to the TPG
Capital platform) will directly or indirectly (but subject in all respects to the immediately succeeding sentence) acquire or agree to acquire by merger or
consolidation with, or by purchasing the assets of or equity in, any person, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation
of such a transaction would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay past the Termination Date (as defined below) the satisfaction of the governmental
consent condition to Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary the restrictions in the foregoing sentence will not apply to any existing portfolio
company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) of CD&R or TPG. Neither Covetrus or Parent, without the other party’s
prior written consent, will (i) withdraw or refile any filing made under the HSR Act or any other antitrust laws or laws relating to foreign investment, (ii)
enter into any timing, settlement or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would have the effect of extending,
suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the contemplated transactions under the
HSR Act or any other antitrust laws or laws relating to foreign investment or (iii) enter into any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit
to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the contemplated transactions (or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit
the parties from consummating the contemplated transactions).
Parent and Covetrus will cooperate with respect to the antitrust laws and laws relating to foreign investment; however, after consulting with the
Company, Parent will have final decision making authority with respect to the appropriate course of action with respect to obtaining the consents,
approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any governmental entity required to consummate the Merger prior to the Termination
Date. No party to the Merger Agreement or its counsel will independently participate in any substantive call or meeting relating to the antitrust laws or
laws relating to foreign investment with any governmental entity in respect of
98
Table of Contents
such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without first giving the other party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such governmental entity, the opportunity to attend and participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent permitted by
applicable law:
•
each party will notify the other, as far in advance as practicable, of any filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of
its subsidiaries intends to make with any governmental entity relating to the Transactions;
•
prior to submitting any such filing or making any such communication or inquiry, such party will provide the other party and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review, and will consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing,
communication or inquiry;
•
promptly following the submission of such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party with a copy of any such
filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry, or a summary of any oral communication; and
•
consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any governmental
entity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any governmental entity relating
thereto.
Parent, including its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
governmental entity in connection with the HSR Act, any other applicable antitrust laws or laws relating to foreign investment with respect to the
Transactions and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the Transactions.
If any administrative or judicial proceeding, including any such proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Merger or any other Transaction as violative of any antitrust law or laws relating to foreign investment, each of the Company and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the
Merger.
However, the Merger Agreement also provides that notwithstanding any of the obligations with respect to efforts relating to antitrust laws and laws
relating to foreign investment described above or any other provisions of the Merger Agreement, nothing in the Merger Agreement will require Merger
Sub, Parent or any of their affiliates (including CD&R and TPG or any investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by,
CD&R or TPG or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or investment of CD&R, TPG or of any
such investment fund or investment vehicle) to, and the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree or otherwise be required to
take any action (including any steps or actions contemplated by this section) with respect to CD&R, TPG or such affiliates, other than with respect to
Parent and/or its subsidiaries.
Access to Information
Upon reasonable advance notice (and in any event not less than twenty-four (24) hours’ notice), and except as may otherwise be required by applicable
law, (x) Covetrus will, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and its subsidiaries’ directors, officers or employees to, and will direct its other
representatives to, afford Parent and its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
Covetrus’ and its subsidiaries’ properties, assets, commitments, tax returns, contracts, books and records and, (y) during such period, Covetrus will, and
will cause its subsidiaries to, furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent all information concerning its or any of its subsidiaries’ capital stock,
business and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the Merger; provided, that no investigation will affect or be
99
Table of Contents
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by Covetrus; and provided further, that the foregoing will not require Covetrus to permit any
invasive environmental sampling or any inspection or to disclose any information, to the extent that (A) in the reasonable good faith judgment of
Covetrus’ outside legal counsel, any applicable law requires Covetrus or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information or
disclosure thereof would expose Covetrus to an unreasonable risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive personal information, (B) in the reasonable good
faith judgment of Covetrus, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or its disclosure would violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or other contract that is binding on Covetrus or any of its subsidiaries, or (C) disclosure of any such information or document
would result in the waiver or loss of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other legal privilege; provided further, that with respect to the
foregoing clauses (A) through (C), Covetrus will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any such third party to
provide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Covetrus
and (3) in the case of clauses (A) and (C), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a
manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction (solely to the extent necessary)
or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so would
reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable law or jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to the
forgoing right of access will be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. All
requests for information made pursuant to the foregoing right of access will be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such person as may be
designated by any such executive officer.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against any and all costs (including settlement costs) or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions)), arising out of or based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person prior to the Effective Time, in each
case, whether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such person is a party,
the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement to indemnify such person (and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; provided that the person to whom
expenses are advanced will provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not
entitled to indemnification). Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries, will, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable, in the aggregate,
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the
Company and its subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational and
governing documents of any subsidiary). The right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to the Merger Agreement will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to,
obtain and fully pay for the D&O Insurance with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the
100
Table of Contents
Transactions); provided, however that in no event will the Company be required to expend for such policies an annual premium in excess of three-
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such
“tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain
in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger
Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement;
provided, however that in no event will the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual
premium amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, provided,
further that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Employee Benefits
Parent has agreed that each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who continues to remain employed with the Company or its subsidiaries
following the Closing (a “Continuing Employee”) will, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing (the “Continuation Period”), be provided with (i) a base salary or base wage that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage provided
to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual (or shorter) cash bonus
opportunities, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the target annual (or shorter) cash bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided by the Company and its subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding,
for all purposes of this clause (iii) severance, defined benefit pension and post-employment medical benefits, equity or other long-term incentive
compensation, stock purchase plan benefits and change-in-control, transaction or retention compensation or benefits). Additionally, Parent has agreed
that each Continuing Employee will, as to any qualifying termination occurring during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
December 31st of the year of the first anniversary of the Closing, be provided with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits under the employee benefits plans set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and
assume all obligations under employment agreements and severance plans listed on the Company Disclosure Letter with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide that no pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods will apply to Continuing
Employees under the benefit plans provided for those employees except to the extent such condition or exclusion was applicable to an individual
Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With respect to the plan year during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent plan in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Closing Date.
From and after the Closing Date, Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide credit (without duplication) to Continuing Employees for
their service recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting, continuous service,
determination of service awards, vacation, paid time off, and severance entitlements to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service was
credited under the employee benefits plans, provided that such service will not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits.

The employee benefits provisions of the Merger Agreement described in this section are solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement,
and neither any current or former employee, nor any other individual associated therewith, is or will be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary to the Merger Agreement. Nothing in the Merger Agreement will be construed to confer on any person, other than the parties, their
successors and permitted assigns, any right to enforce the provisions of the employee benefits covenants in the Merger Agreement or be construed as
an amendment of any employee benefits plan (including employment agreements) or the requirement to maintain any existing or adopt any new employee
benefits plan (including employment agreements).
Financing Cooperation
Each of Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to, and Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to, use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the financing on terms (including the “market flex” provisions) and conditions no less
favorable to Parent than those described in the Equity Commitment Letters provided by affiliates of CD&R and TPG and the Original Debt Commitment
Letter (collectively, the “Commitment Letters”), including using reasonable best efforts, after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the earlier of
the Closing Date and the date the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, to:
•
negotiate definitive financing agreements with respect to the financing (the “Definitive Financing Agreements”) on terms and conditions no
less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letters (including any “market flex” terms and conditions), provided,
however, that in no event will any of the Definitive Financing Agreements (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the financing provided for in
the Commitment Letters (including by changing the amount of fees or original issue discount contemplated by the Commitment Letters)
such that Parent would not have sufficient cash proceeds to permit Parent to pay the Required Amount on the Closing Date; (B) expand the
conditions or other contingencies relating to the receipt or funding of the financing beyond those expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letters, amend or modify any of such conditions or other contingencies or impose any new or additional condition or other contingency
relating to the receipt or funding of the financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) make the funding of the
financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the financing) less likely to occur or (y) materially delay or prevent the Closing;
(C) contain terms (other than those terms expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters) that could reasonably be expected to materially
delay the Effective Time or the date on which the financing would be obtained or make the timely funding of the financing less likely to
occur; or (D) adversely impacts the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against any of the other parties to the Commitment
Letters or Definitive Financing Agreements;
•
enter into Definitive Financing Agreements with respect thereto and consummate the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
substantially concurrently with the Closing;
•
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period and the Closing) or obtain the waiver of all
covenants and conditions in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements that are within Parent’s control;
•
pay in a timely manner any commitment or other fees that are or become payable under any of the Commitment Letters or Definitive
Financing Agreements on or following the date of the Merger Agreement;
•
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and Definitive Financing Agreements; and
•
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the financing to be funded in full substantially concurrently with the Closing.
Parent has agreed to furnish promptly upon request correct and complete copies of all material Definitive Financing Agreements to the Company. Without
limiting any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement,
102
Table of Contents
Parent has agreed to keep the Company informed in writing upon request on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail with respect to the status of
the financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent has agreed to give the Company and the Company’s legal counsel reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon drafts of all commitment letters and Definitive Financing Agreements, and to give due consideration to all reasonable comments and
changes proposed on behalf of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to give the Company
prompt notice upon having knowledge of (i) any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) on the part of any party to any Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing Agreement, (ii) the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any person with respect to any
actual or potential material breach, default or dispute by or involving any party under any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement, (iii) any
actual or purported termination, rescission or repudiation of any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement, or any provision thereof, (iv) any
actual material dispute or disagreement with any person expected to provide any portion of the financing and (v) any other circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent to obtain, prior to the date the Closing is required to occur in accordance
with the Merger Agreement, all or any portion of the financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Commitment
Letters or Definitive Financing Agreements.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub will agree to or permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision (including any
termination or reduction of any commitment and/or any consent to any assignment, termination or release) or remedy under (including through the
execution of any “side” letter), any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of the financing provided for in the Commitment Letters (including by changing the amount of fees or original issue discount
contemplated in the Commitment Letters) such that Parent would not have sufficient cash proceeds to permit Parent to pay the Required Amount on the
Closing Date or (ii) would reasonably be expected to (x) make the funding of the financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
financing) less likely to occur, (y) materially delay or prevent the Closing or (z) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against any of the other parties to the Commitment Letters; provided that (i) Parent may replace, amend, supplement or modify the Original Debt
Commitment Letter to add bona fide lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities (or titles with respect to such entities) that
have not executed the Original Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of the Merger Agreement (it being understood that the aggregate commitments of
the lenders party to the Original Debt Commitment Letter prior to such replacement, amendment, supplement or modification may be reduced in the
amount of such additional party’s binding commitments under the relevant replacement, amendment, supplement or modification, which will otherwise
contain the terms set forth in the Original Debt Commitment Letter immediately prior to such replacement, amendment, supplement or modification, unless
any modification (other than the addition of the relevant bona fide lender, lead arranger, bookrunner, syndication agent or similar entity (or additional
title)) would otherwise be permitted by the terms of the provision of the Merger Agreement described in this section) and (ii) Parent will notify the
Company in writing of any replacement, amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waiver of any of its rights under, any Commitment Letter
reasonably promptly after the time such replacement, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is agreed.
In the event that any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Original Debt Commitment
Letter (including any “market flex” provisions that are contained in the redacted fee letter related to the Original Debt Commitment Letter (the “Redacted
Fee Letter”) (other than as a result of the Company’s failure to satisfy the conditions to closing with respect to stockholder approvals, governmental
consents and no law being enacted that would restrain, enjoin or prohibit the consummation of the Merger, representations and warranties of the
Company, performance of obligations of the Company, no Company material adverse effect and delivery of a certificate with respect to such the
immediately preceding conditions), Parent will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient such that the
aggregate funds that would be available to Parent at the Closing will be sufficient to pay the Required Amount) (the “Alternative Financing”); provided
that Parent will not be required to arrange or obtain any Alternative Financing having terms and conditions (including “market flex” provisions), taken as
a
103
Table of Contents
whole, less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Original Debt Commitment Letter (after giving effect to any “market flex” provision applicable
under the Original Debt Commitment Letter); it being understood and agreed that in no event will the obligation of Parent under this provision require
Parent to pay fees, interest rates or other amounts that, taken as a whole, exceed the aggregate fees, interest rates or such other amounts contemplated
under the Original Debt Commitment Letter and the Redacted Fee Letter as of the date of the Merger Agreement (including giving effect to any market flex
provisions set forth therein); provided, further, that Parent will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment letter pursuant to which
any Alternative Financing will be made available to Parent promptly after the time such agreement is agreed, to the extent needed to fund the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “New Commitment Letter”) (provided, that the existence and/or amount of fees, flex provisions, pricing
terms, pricing caps and other commercially sensitive information set forth therein or in any fee letter may be redacted to the extent consistent with the
redactions permitted by the term “Redacted Fee Letter”) which New Commitment Letter will not include any conditions to the consummation of the
Alternative Financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the debt financing taken as a whole and (ii) if applicable, promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor.
To the extent applicable, Parent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions described in any New Commitment Letter. In the
event Alternative Financing is obtained, references in the Merger Agreement to the financing will also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing,
and if one or more commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such
Alternative Financing, references in the Merger Agreement to the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements will also be deemed to
refer to such commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to this provision will be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations with respect to the financing.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company has agreed to, and has agreed to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, in each
case, use reasonable best efforts to, provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is reasonably necessary and customary for
financings of the type contemplated by the Original Debt Commitment Letter, and at Parent’s sole expense, in connection with Parent’s arrangement and

and (y) furnishing any other information related to the Company and its subsidiaries customarily delivered by a borrower and reasonably

type contemplated by the debt financing; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a breach of this requirement will
not give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in the provision requiring compliance in all material respects with obligations under the
Merger Agreement to be satisfied unless such breach is the primary cause of the failure of the debt financing to be obtained on or prior to
the Closing Date;
•
cause senior management of the Company, with appropriate seniority and expertise, to assist in preparation for, and participate in, a
reasonable number of investor and lender meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings and calls with or by the parties acting as

rating agencies in each case, to the extent required in connection with the debt financing;
•
provide assistance with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, syndication memoranda,

their respective businesses as may be required in connection with the preparation of such pro forma financial statements; provided that

the proposed debt and equity capitalization that is required for such pro forma financial information or assumed interest rates and fees and
expenses relating to such debt and equity capitalization, (B) any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization,

Company;

or the financing sources and (B) facilitate the pledge of, grant of security interests in and obtain perfection of any liens on collateral in
connection with the debt financing; provided, that, except in the case of customary authorization letters, (I) no liability will be imposed on

effectiveness thereof will be conditioned upon, or become operative as of or after, the occurrence of the Closing;

such information to be included in any bank information memoranda or other customary marketing materials to be provided to potential
financing sources who do not wish to receive material nonpublic information with respect to any of the Company, its subsidiaries or any of
their respective securities; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a breach of this requirement will not give rise to

Agreement to be satisfied unless such breach is the primary cause of the failure of the debt financing to be obtained on or prior to the
Closing Date;

•
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Covetrus in the Merger Agreement, or any such

bullets of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s Closing Conditions would not be satisfied and such breach or failure to be true is not curable prior to
the Termination Date or, if curable prior to the Termination Date, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following written notice

Agreement and abandon the Merger and the Transactions and (ii) three (3) business days prior to the Termination Date; provided that
Parent will not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement described in this bullet if Parent is then in material breach of any of its

Termination Right”);

Miscellaneous
Specific Performance
The parties to the Merger Agreement have acknowledged and agreed that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the parties to the Merger Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, will be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement by the other party, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of the Merger Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving actual harm or damages or posting a bond or other
security therefor, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party has agreed that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or
that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the
foregoing, the parties have further acknowledged and agreed that prior to the Closing, the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub
under the Merger Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including the Company’s right to
terminate the Merger Agreement and seek money damages (including
111
Table of Contents
damages based on loss of the expected economic benefits of the transaction to the Company). Each party to the Merger Agreement has further agreed
that it will not take any position in any legal proceeding concerning the Merger Agreement that is contrary to the terms of the specific performance
provisions of the Merger Agreement. Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub and each of their respective affiliates to perform their respective obligations
under the Merger Agreement.
The parties to the Merger Agreement have explicitly agreed that, notwithstanding the specific performance provisions described in the paragraph
immediately above, the Company will be entitled to specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance
with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters to fund the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and consummate the Closing only in
the event that (i) all conditions described in the first two bullets of the Mutual Closing Conditions have been satisfied or waived (other than those that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) and Parent fails to consummate the Merger on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, (ii) the financing provided for by the Original Debt Commitment Letter (or, if Alternative Financing is being used, pursuant to the
Alternative Financing commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing and (iii) the Company has delivered an irrevocable notice that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and debt financing are funded. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive
agreements for any Financing under the terms thereof, none of the Company and its affiliates and their direct and indirect equityholders will be entitled to
seek the remedy of specific performance of the Merger Agreement against any financing source.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the exercise of the Company’s or any of its subsidiaries’ right to seek specific performance reduce, restrict or
otherwise limit the Company’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms and/or pursue all applicable remedies at law, including
seeking payment of the Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company or any of its affiliates be entitled to the
Parent Termination Fee if they have been granted specific performance of the Merger Agreement and the Closing actually occurs.
Amendment of the Merger Agreement
Subject to the provisions of applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Agreement (including any schedule thereto) may be
amended, modified or supplemented in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and Covetrus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendments or modifications to
provisions which the financing sources or equity investors are expressly made third-party beneficiaries will be permitted in a manner materially adverse to
any financing source or equity investor without the prior written consent of such financing source or equity investor.
Waiver
Any provision of the Merger Agreement may be waived prior to the Effective Time if, and only if, such waiver is in writing and signed by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by any party of any provision in the Merger Agreement will be effective unless such waiver
complies with the consent required of the financing sources as described above in the section titled “The Merger Agreement—Miscellaneous
—Amendment of the Merger Agreement.”
Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; No Jury Trial
The Merger Agreement is governed by Delaware law, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of the parties to the Merger
Agreement has (i) consented to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware and any appellate court therefrom, in the event any
112
Table of Contents
dispute arises out of or related to the Merger Agreement or any of the Transactions, (ii) agreed that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agreed that it will not bring any action, suit, arbitration or proceeding by or
before any governmental entity (each, an “Action”) relating to the Merger Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware and any
appellate court therefrom, (iv) waived any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Action in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware and any appellate court
therefrom or that such Action was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same, and (v) consented to service being made
through the notice procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agreed that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the addresses set forth in the Merger Agreement will be effective service of process for any
Action in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Covetrus has agreed that any legal action or proceeding involving any financing source arising out of or relating to the
Merger Agreement, the Original Debt Commitment Letter, or the debt financing will be brought and determined in the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof; provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, then any such legal
action or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the State of New York (and, in each case, any appellate courts thereof). Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and Covetrus has agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding involving any financing source arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement, the
Original Debt Commitment Letter or the debt financing and the transactions contemplated thereby or by the Merger Agreement. The Company (on behalf
of itself and its subsidiaries) and Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to waive any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to any debt
financing obtained by Parent or its subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby.
Expenses
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the termination fees discussed above, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the
party incurring such expense, except that (i) the fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with (x) the filing of the Schedule 13e-3 and this proxy
statement and (y) the printing and mailing of this proxy statement will be shared equally by Parent and the Company and (ii) Parent will be responsible for,
and pay, one hundred percent (100%) of the fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filings required under the HSR Act and any other
filings required or advisable by any governmental entity.
All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
Merger will be paid by or on behalf of Parent when due and payable.

"COVETRUS, INC._20220913_DEFM14A_20336819_4516858.Pdf",SUPPORT AND ROLLOVER AGREEMENT,"SUPPORT AND ROLLOVER AGREEMENT
This section describes the material terms of the Support and Rollover Agreement entered into and executed between Parent, CD&R VFC Holdings and the
Company on May 24, 2022. The description in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete
text of the Support and Rollover Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its
entirety. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Support and Rollover Agreement. You are
encouraged to read the Support and Rollover Agreement carefully and in its entirety.
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement on May 24, 2022, and as a condition and inducement to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company’s
willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Company, CD&R VFC Holdings and Parent entered into the Support and Rollover Agreement with
respect to CD&R VFC’s shares of Company common stock. As of the date of the execution of the Support and Rollover Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings
owned 33,670,541 shares of Company common stock, which constituted approximately 24.03% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock as of
September 9, 2022.
Pursuant to the Support and Rollover Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings has agreed to, and agreed to cause its applicable affiliates to, affirmatively vote or
cause to be voted all of its shares of Company common stock (a) in favor of (“for”) (i) approval of the Merger, (ii) the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and (iii) each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or necessary or desirable to further any other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any proposal to adjourn the applicable meeting that the Board supports as long as such
adjournment is in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) and (b) against any action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to
result in any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled.
In the event the Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) or the Transaction Committee makes a Change in
Recommendation against the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings may vote its shares of Company common stock
with respect to the above matters in any manner it chooses.
Further, pursuant to the Support and Rollover Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings has agreed to transfer, directly or indirectly, its shares of Company
common stock, which otherwise would be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration in cash, to Parent (or its parent company),
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in exchange for newly issued equity interests of Parent (or its parent company), with an aggregate value equal to
the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration that would have been payable to CD&R VFC Holdings in respect of its shares of Company common
stock.
In addition, CD&R VFC Holdings agreed to not take certain actions, including not (i) tendering any of its shares of Company common stock into any
tender or exchange offer, (ii) transferring any of its shares of Company common stock, (iii) granting any proxies or powers of attorney or (iv) taking any
action that would make any representation or warranty of CD&R VFC Holdings contained in the Support and Rollover Agreement untrue or incorrect in
any material respect or have the effect of preventing or disabling CD&R VFC Holdings from performing its obligations under the Support and Rollover
Agreement in any material respect.
Pursuant to the Support and Rollover Agreement, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee, the Company (i)
irrevocably waived, and has agreed not to enforce, the obligations of CD&R VFC Holdings and its affiliates pursuant to Section 5.07 of the Investment
Agreement, with respect to any actions taken by CD&R VFC Holdings and/or their affiliates in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger (and all other transactions incidental and related thereto) and the exercise of any rights pursuant to the Merger
Agreement and (ii) acknowledged and agreed that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger (and all other transactions
incidental and related thereto) and the exercise of any rights pursuant to the Merger Agreement are (and will be deemed to be) permitted under the
Investment Agreement.
The Support and Rollover Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

“safe harbor” provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including statements about the potential benefits of
the Merger, anticipated growth rates, the Company’s plans, objectives, expectations, and the anticipated timing of the closing of the Merger. Forward-
looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,”
“expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “targets” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,”
“should,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “aims,” “intends” or “projects.” However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a
statement is not forward-looking.
We caution that forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions about future events and are qualified by the existence of certain risks
and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from what is contemplated by the forward-looking

meeting, is entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each such holder will be entitled to one vote for each share of Company
common stock that it owned on the record date. As of September 7, 2022, there were 140,122,753 shares of Company common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. You will have one vote for each share of Company common stock that you owned of record on
the record date.
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares
of Company common stock entitled to vote at the meeting constitutes a quorum for the special meeting.
If you are a Covetrus stockholder of record and you vote by mail, by telephone or through the internet or at the special meeting via the virtual meeting
website, then your shares of Company common stock will be counted as part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Company
common stock and you provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Company common stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other
nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.
A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Once a share of Company common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is
present via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the
special meeting and any adjournment of the special meeting, even if the share of Company common stock is not voted, including any shares of Company
common stock for which a stockholder directs to abstain from voting.
Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Covetrus, the Presiding Officer (as defined in the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Covetrus) or the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter, present or
represented by proxy, may adjourn such meeting to a later date and time.

binding on Covetrus or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is approved by Covetrus stockholders and the
Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to the Company’s named executive officers
even if this proposal is not approved. Failure to vote will have no effect on approval of the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
Adjournment Proposal. The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires, assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement on May 24, 2022, and as a condition and inducement to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company’s
willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Company, CD&R VFC Holdings and Parent entered into the Support and Rollover Agreement with
respect to its shares of Company common stock. Pursuant to the Support and Rollover Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings has agreed to, and agreed to
cause its applicable affiliates to, affirmatively vote or cause to be voted all of its shares of Company common stock (a) in favor of (“for”) (i) approval of
the Merger, (ii) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (iii) each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or necessary or
desirable to further any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any proposal to adjourn the
applicable meeting that the Board supports as long as such adjournment is in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) and (b) against any
action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger under the Merger Agreement
not being fulfilled. In the event the Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) or the Transaction Committee has made a
change in recommendation against the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings may vote its shares with respect to the
above matters in any manner it chooses.
As of the date of the execution of the Support and Rollover Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings owned 33,670,541 shares of Company common stock, which
constituted approximately 24.03% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock as of September 9, 2022.

A broker non-vote with respect to Company common stock occurs when (i) shares of Company common stock held by a broker or other nominee are
represented, in person (or virtually) or by proxy, at a meeting of Covetrus stockholders, (ii) the bank, broker or other nominee has not received voting
instructions from the beneficial owner on a particular proposal and (iii) the bank, broker or other nominee does not have the discretion to direct the voting
of the shares of Company common stock on a particular proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals. A bank, broker, trust or other
nominee may exercise discretion in voting on routine matters but may not exercise discretion and therefore will not vote on non-routine matters if
instructions are not given. Under applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. As a result, there
will not be any broker non-votes at the special meeting.
Accordingly, if your shares of Company common stock are held in “street name,” a bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your
shares, and your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee on how to vote.

If you submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet voting procedures, but do not include “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on a

If you wish to vote by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting website and your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder
of record, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank, broker or other holder of record authorizing you to vote at the special
meeting. Obtaining a legal proxy may take several days.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation
The approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal requires, assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter. Abstentions and failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.
Your vote is very important. If you fail to return your proxy, vote by telephone or through the internet or virtually attend the special meeting, your
shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal. If you, as Covetrus stockholder, return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions
on your proxy card, your shares of Company common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

The Proposal
As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our stockholders the
opportunity to cast a vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Covetrus’ named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed in the section entitled “Special Factors—Golden Parachute
Compensation,” beginning on page 72, including the table in such section and accompanying footnotes.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon Covetrus or the Board, and approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the
Merger. Because the Merger-related executive compensation to be paid in connection with the Merger is based on the terms of the Merger Agreement as
well as the contractual arrangements between Covetrus and the named executive officers, such compensation may be paid or become payable, regardless
of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the Merger Agreement is adopted (subject only to the contractual conditions in the Merger Agreement applicable
thereto as well as any applicable contractual arrangements between Covetrus and the named executive officers). Accordingly, you are asked to vote on
the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Covetrus, Inc. approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to the named executive officers of Covetrus, Inc. that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K under the heading “Special Factors—Golden Parachute Compensation,” beginning on page 72 (which disclosure includes the
Golden Parachute Compensation Table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”
If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions on your proxy card, your shares of Company common stock represented by
such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
The approval of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter, present or represented by proxy. The vote is advisory only and, therefore, not binding on
Covetrus or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Covetrus’ stockholders and the Merger is
completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be paid or become payable to our named executive officers even if
this proposal is not approved.
The Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, have been unanimously approved and recommended by the Transaction
Committee. The Board, by a unanimous vote of the Company’s directors (other than the Recused Directors), recommends a vote “FOR” the Merger-
Related Compensation Proposal.

The Proposal
The Company is asking you to approve one or more proposals to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate,
including adjournments to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to Company stockholders a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the special meeting or to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting
to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. If the Company’s stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, the Company could adjourn the special
meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies
from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement Proposal (other than in respect of any
proposal for which the vote has been taken and the polls have been closed at the special meeting). Among other things, approval of the Adjournment
Proposal could mean that, even if the Company had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal
such that the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, the Company could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement
Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares of Company common stock to change their votes to votes in favor of any such proposal.
Additionally, the Company may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present at the special meeting.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Company common stock
entitled to vote on such matter, present or represented by proxy. In addition, the Presiding Officer (as defined in the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
Covetrus) or the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter,
present or represented by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time.
If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions on your proxy card, your shares of Company common stock represented by
such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate.
The Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, have been unanimously approved and recommended by the Transaction
Committee. The Board, by a unanimous vote of the Company’s directors (other than the Recused Directors), recommends a vote “FOR” the

"COVETRUS, INC._20220913_DEFM14A_20336819_4516858.Pdf",APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Record holders of Company common stock who comply with the procedures summarized below will be entitled to appraisal rights if the Merger is
completed. Under Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as “Section 262”), holders of shares of Company common stock with respect to which
appraisal rights are properly demanded and perfected and not withdrawn or lost are entitled, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration, to have the
“fair value” of their shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) at the Effective Time
judicially determined and paid to them in cash by complying with the provisions of Section 262. Covetrus is required to send a notice to that effect to
each stockholder not less than 20 days prior to the special meeting. This proxy statement constitutes that notice to the record holders of Company
common stock.
The following is a brief summary of Section 262, which sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not
a complete statement of the applicable requirements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached to
this proxy statement as Annex D. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in
Annex D. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 may result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL. If you
hold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult
with your bank, broker or the other nominee. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a
recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.
Stockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must do ALL of the following: (i) not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, (ii) deliver in the manner set forth below a written demand for appraisal of the stockholder’s shares of Company common stock to the
Secretary of Covetrus before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the special meeting, (iii) continuously hold the shares of record from
the date of making the demand through completion of the Merger and (iv) otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262.
Only a holder of record of Company common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for
appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on
the certificates representing shares. If shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must
be executed by the fiduciary. If shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be
executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal
for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose that, in exercising the demand, the agent is acting
as agent for the record owner or owners.
A record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares as a nominee for others may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less
than all beneficial owners of shares as to which the holder is the record owner. In that case, the written demand must set forth the number of shares
covered by the demand. Where the number of shares is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares outstanding in the name of
the record owner.
Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should consult with the record owner to determine the
appropriate procedures for having the record holder make a demand for appraisal with respect to the beneficial owner’s shares. Any holder of shares held
in “street name” who desires appraisal rights with respect to those shares must take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper
demand for appraisal is made by the record owner of the shares.
127Table of Contents
Shares of Company common stock held through brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record
in the name of a nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co., The Depository Trust Company’s nominee. A demand for appraisal with
respect to such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and it must identify the depository nominee as the record owner. Any
beneficial holder of shares desiring appraisal rights with respect to such shares which are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial
institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder.
As required by Section 262, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform Covetrus of the identity of the record holder (which
might be a nominee as described above) and of such holder’s intention to seek appraisal of the holder’s shares.
Stockholders of record who elect to demand appraisal of their shares must mail or deliver their written demand to:
Covetrus, Inc.
7 Custom House Street, Portland, ME 04101
Attention: Margaret Pritchard, Interim General Counsel and Secretary
The written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder’s name and mailing address. The written demand must reasonably inform Covetrus that
the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of his, her or its shares. The written demand must be received by Covetrus prior to the vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the special meeting. Neither voting (via the virtual meeting website or by proxy) against, abstaining from voting
on or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will alone suffice to constitute a written demand for appraisal within the meaning of
Section 262. In addition, the stockholder must not vote its shares of Company common stock in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. An executed
proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and will cause the
stockholder’s right of appraisal to be lost. Therefore, a stockholder who desires to exercise appraisal rights should either (x) refrain from executing and
submitting the enclosed proxy card or (y) vote by proxy against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or affirmatively register an abstention with
respect thereto.
Within 120 days after completion of the Merger, but not thereafter, either the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who has timely and properly
demanded appraisal of such stockholder’s shares and who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights,
or any beneficial owner for which a demand for appraisal has been properly made by the record holder, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares of all stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of Covetrus
as the Surviving Corporation to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the Surviving
Corporation will file such a petition or that the Surviving Corporation will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares.
Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights
within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.
Within 120 days after completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon
request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the
notice of appraisal), to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Company common stock not
voting in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the Surviving Corporation and the number of holders of
such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of
128
Table of Contents
shares held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the Surviving
Corporation for the statement described in the previous sentence. Such statement must be given within 10 days after the request therefor has been
received by the Surviving Corporation.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a Covetrus stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, then the Surviving
Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified
list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Company common stock and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares of Company common stock have not been reached. After notice to stockholders who have demanded appraisal,
if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and determine
those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require
the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to
the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery must dismiss an appraisal
proceeding as to all Covetrus stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares
seeking appraisal exceeds $1,000,000, or (iii) the Merger was approved pursuant to Section 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL. Where proceedings are not
dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted, as to the shares of Company common stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the
rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
After a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and thereafter will
appraise the shares owned by those stockholders, determining the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in subsection (h) of Section 262,
interest from the date the Merger is completed through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established from time to time during the period between the date the Merger is completed
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the combined company may pay to each former
Covetrus stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in Section 262 only upon the sum
of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii)
interests theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., et al., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered in an appraisal proceeding and that “[f]air
price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making
this determination of fair value the court may consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any
other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262
provides that fair value is to be determined “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware
Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of
proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
129
Table of Contents
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 could be more than, the
same as, or less than the Merger Consideration they are entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they do not seek appraisal of their
shares, and that opinions of investment banking firms as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction are
not opinions as to fair value under Section 262. Covetrus reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the
“fair value” of a share of Company common stock is less than the applicable Merger Consideration.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys’ and expert witness fees. The Delaware Court of Chancery may
order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by such stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of
such a determination of assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
From and after the date of completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after
completion of the Merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to completion of the Merger.
Within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger became effective to each of Covetrus’
stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262. At any time within 60 days after
completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has demanded appraisal and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding
as a named party will have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the cash to which the stockholder is entitled
pursuant to the Merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal only with the written approval of the
Surviving Corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days after completion of the Merger,
stockholders’ rights to appraisal will cease and all stockholders will be entitled only to receive the Merger Consideration as provided for in the Merger
Agreement. No petition timely filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding appraisal will be dismissed as to any stockholders without the approval
of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and that approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. However, the
preceding sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined the proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after completion of the
Merger.
The foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 that sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a
complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached as
Annex D to this proxy statement.
Failure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your
appraisal rights.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual
reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable,
addressed to those stockholders. As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement is being delivered to stockholders residing at
the same address, unless stockholders have notified Covetrus of their desire to receive multiple copies of this proxy statement. This process, which is
commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. If, at any time, you no
longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of this proxy
statement and wish to receive only one, please contact Covetrus at the address below. Covetrus will promptly deliver, upon oral or written request, a
separate copy of this proxy statement to any stockholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Requests for additional copies
should be directed to our Secretary at c/o Covetrus, Inc., 7 Custom House Street, Portland, ME 04101.

We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available to the public at the SEC’s
website at www.sec.gov. You also may obtain free copies of the documents we file with the SEC, including this proxy statement, by going to the Investors
page of our corporate website at www.covetrus.com. The information provided on our website, other than copies of the documents listed below that have
been filed with the SEC, is not part of this proxy statement, and therefore is not incorporated herein by reference.
Statements contained in this proxy statement, or in any document incorporated in this proxy statement by reference, regarding the contents of any
contract or other document, are not necessarily complete, and each such statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to that contract or other
document filed as an exhibit with the SEC. The SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” into this proxy statement documents we file with the SEC.
This means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to those documents. The information incorporated by reference is
considered to be a part of this proxy statement. This proxy statement and the information that we later file with the SEC may update and supersede the
information incorporated by reference and may update and supersede the information in this proxy statement.
We also incorporate by reference the documents listed below and any documents filed by us pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act after the date of this proxy statement and before the date of the special meeting (provided that we are not incorporating by reference any information
furnished to, but not filed with, the SEC):

We also incorporate by reference into this proxy statement, but not into the Schedule 13e-3, additional documents that the Company may file with the
SEC under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act from the date of this proxy statement to the date of the special meeting. We will amend the
Schedule 13e-3 to incorporate by reference any additional documents that the Company may file with the SEC under Section 13(a),
144Table of Contents
13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act from the date of this proxy statement to the date of the special meeting to the extent required to fulfill the

Any statement contained in a document incorporated by reference into this proxy statement will be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of
this proxy statement to the extent that a statement contained in this proxy statement or any other subsequently filed document that is incorporated by

proxy statement and, with respect to this proxy statement but not with respect to the Schedule 13e-3, later information that the Company files with the

ARTICLE I
THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

(in such capacity, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”), and become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and the separate
corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger
shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger (as defined below).
1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties
hereto, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall be conducted remotely via the electronic exchange of documents and signatures at 10:00 a.m.,

Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement; provided
that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), the Closing shall instead
occur on the date that is the earlier to occur of (a) any Business Day during the Marketing Period specified by Parent to the Company on no less than two
(2) Business Days’ notice (unless a shorter period shall be agreed to by Parent and the Company) and (b) the third (3rd) Business Day after the final day
of the Marketing Period. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date”.
1.3 Effective Time. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger with respect to the Merger (the “Certificate
of Merger”) to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective on the date and at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such later date or time as may be agreed upon by the Company and Parent in writing and set forth in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the
DGCL (the “Effective Time”).
ARTICLE II
ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by the name of the Surviving Corporation and (b) for such changes as are agreed by the parties and necessary to
comply with Section 6.11 and the terms of this Agreement, and as such shall be the Certificate of Incorporation until thereafter amended as provided

Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation to hold office until their respective successors have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL, the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws.
2.4 Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation and the
Bylaws.
ARTICLE III
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SECURITIES;
EXCHANGE
3.1 Effect on Capital Stock.
(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:
(i) Merger Consideration. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Company (the “Shares” and each a “Share”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including the
Stockholder Rollover Shares), (ii) Shares owned by the Company as treasury stock (each such Share referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, an “Excluded
Share” and, collectively, the “Excluded Shares”) and (iii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (“Dissenting Stockholders”) who have perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) shall be converted into the right to receive $21.00 per Share in cash,
without interest thereon (the “Merger Consideration”). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Shares owned by
Dissenting Stockholders) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and (A) each certificate (a “Certificate”) formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares and Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders) and (B) each book-entry account formerly
representing any uncertificated Shares (“Uncertificated Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares and Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender thereof in accordance with Section 3.2, and each Certificate and Uncertificated
Share formerly representing Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment of which reference
is made in Section 3.3.
(ii) Cancellation of Excluded Shares and each Share owned by Dissenting Stockholders. Subject to Section 3.3, each Excluded Share and each Share
owned by Dissenting Stockholders outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist.
(b) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation.

3.2 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Company’s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (the “Paying Agent”), for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, an aggregate amount of cash comprising approximately the amounts required to be delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(a) in respect of Shares
(such aggregate amount of cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; provided that (i) such investments shall be an obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers’ acceptances of commercial banks and (ii) no such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(a). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make all
cash payments required pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i). No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall enter into an agreement
with the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the applicable terms of this Agreement.
(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e))
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)).
Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of
such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in immediately available funds (or, if
no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholding provided in Section 3.2(f)) equal
to the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares represented by a
Certificate that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in
each case, reasonably acceptable to Parent.
(c) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parent’s option, to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of any payment of cash (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(f)) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
A-4
Table of Contents
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent permitted by Law,
immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger
Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form
and substance satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as an
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(f)) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.
(f) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be timely remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice to the Company at least five (5)
days prior to making any deduction or withholding pursuant to this Section 3.2(f) (together with the legal basis thereof) and shall cooperate in good faith
to obtain any available exemption from, or reduction of, such deduction or withholding.
(g) Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to (i) mail to each registered holder of Uncertificated Shares (other than in respect of Excluded Shares and Shares owned by Dissenting
Stockholders) materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and (ii) deliver the cash that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of its Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(f)), without interest thereon.
3.3 Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive cash pursuant to the
provisions of this ARTICLE III unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s
right to appraisal under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If, after the Effective Time, any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall finally determine that the Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled to relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect
to any Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration without interest and less any required Tax withholding. The Company shall give Parent written notice as promptly as practicable of
any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
A-5
Table of Contents
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders’ rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands. Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. Any amounts required to be paid in respect of any Shares held by a Dissenting Stockholder shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation.
3.4 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares, in each case issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration; provided that nothing in this Section 3.4 shall be construed to permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person to take any action that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
3.5 Treatment of Equity Awards.
(a) Treatment of Stock Options. At the Effective Time, with respect to each outstanding option to purchase Shares (other than rights to purchase Shares
under the ESPP) (a “Company Option”) granted under the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (collectively, the “Company Stock Plans”),
whether vested or unvested, (i) if the per Share exercise price of such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any consideration being payable in respect
thereof, and have no further force or effect and (ii) if the per Share exercise price of such Company Option is less than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Company Option would not otherwise vest) and shall terminate
and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 3.5(a), a
lump sum cash payment in the amount equal to (x) the number of Shares underlying the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (y) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price (the product of (x) and (y), the “Option Payment”).
From and after the Effective Time, each Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to
the payment of the amount described in this Section 3.5(a), if any. Parent shall, or, if applicable, shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay the Option
Payment (if any) payable under this Section 3.5(a) to each former holder of a Company Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll to such former holder, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later
than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.2(f).
(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Each outstanding restricted stock unit that is subject to timed-based vesting conditions (a “Restricted Stock
Unit”), that was granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Restricted Stock Unit would not otherwise vest) and shall terminate and
be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount equal
to (i) the number of Shares underlying such Restricted Stock Unit, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration. Following the Effective Time, no such
Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and each former holder of any such
Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 3.5(b) in
exchange for such Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with this Section 3.5(b). Parent shall, or, if applicable, shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay the
consideration payable under this Section 3.5(b) to each former holder of a Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll to such former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later
than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.2(f).
A-6
Table of Contents
(c) Treatment of Performance Restricted Stock Units. Each outstanding performance restricted stock unit that is subject to performance-based vesting
conditions (each, a “Performance Restricted Stock Unit”) that was granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding or payable as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Performance
Restricted Stock Unit would not otherwise vest) and shall terminate and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in
exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the number of Shares subject to such Performance Restricted Stock Unit
that would vest based on the target level of achievement (provided that in no event shall such number of Shares exceed 990,000), multiplied by (ii) the
Merger Consideration. Following the Effective Time, no such Performance Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding and each former holder of any such Performance Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 3.5(c) in exchange for such Performance Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with this
Section 3.5(c). Parent shall, or, if applicable, shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay the consideration payable under this Section 3.5(c) to each former
holder of a Performance Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll to
such former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), net of any Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 3.2(f).
(d) Treatment of Company Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each Share subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (the “Company
Restricted Stock”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest (to the extent such Company Restricted Stock would not otherwise
vest) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and be treated
in the same manner as all other Shares for such purposes.
(e) Treatment of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “ESPP”) and all outstanding rights thereunder as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing. The offering or purchase period under the ESPP that would be in effect as of the Effective Time (the “Final Offering Period”) shall terminate no
later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall cause the exercise date applicable to the Final Offering Period to
accelerate and occur on the termination date of the ESPP with respect to any then-outstanding purchase rights. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) all amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the ESPP at the end of the Final Offering Period shall thereupon
be used to purchase whole Shares under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which Shares shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a) following the purchase of the Company Shares, (ii) the Company shall
return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase and (iii) the Company shall take such steps as
may be necessary such that, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, (x) no new participants may commence participation in the ESPP, (y) no
current participant in the ESPP may increase his or her rate of contribution under the ESPP and (z) no new offering period will commence after the date of
this Agreement.
(f) Further Action. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board of
directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 3.5.

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
4.2 Capital Structure.
(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (x) 675,000,000 Shares and (y) 10,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred

Merger.

5.7 Financial Ability.
(a) Section 5.7(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth true, accurate and complete copies of:
(i) a fully executed debt commitment letter (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto and the Redacted Fee Letter, in each case as
amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time, in each case as permitted by this Agreement, collectively, the “Debt
Commitment Letter”) from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”) relating to the commitment of the Lenders to provide the full amount of
the debt financing contemplated thereby to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions contemplated
thereby, and to refinance certain outstanding indebtedness of the Company, including the Existing Credit Agreement, and to pay all related fees and
expenses (the “Debt Financing”), and
(ii) fully executed equity commitment letters (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto, as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or
extended from time to time, in each case as permitted by the Agreement the “Equity Commitment Letters” and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the “Commitment Letters”) from certain persons (the “Equity Investors”) relating to the commitment of the Equity Investors to provide the amount of the
cash equity contemplated thereby, on the terms and conditions set forth therein, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
pay related fees and expenses (the “Equity Financing”, together with the Debt Financing, is collectively referred to as the “Financing”). Each Equity
Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter and is entitled to enforce such
agreement, and that Parent and the Equity Investors will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the
basis that there is adequate remedy at law in connection with the exercise of such third party beneficiary rights, in each case in
A-25
Table of Contents
accordance with its terms and subject to the limitations set forth herein, including in Section 9.13 (Specific Performance).
(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters are legal, valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto, are in full force and effect, and
are enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with their terms, subject only to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) none of the Commitment Letters has been amended, restated or otherwise modified (and, except as permitted under this Agreement, no
such amendment, restatement or modification is contemplated) (provided that the existence or exercise of “market flex” provisions contained in the
Redacted Fee Letter shall not constitute an amendment, restatement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter) and (ii) the respective commitments
set forth in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Equity Investors or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto (and, except as permitted under this Agreement, no such withdrawal,
rescission, amendment, restatement or modification is contemplated by Parent, Merger Sub or the Equity Investors or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other party thereto). As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letters, other than any such default, breach or failure that has been waived by the Lenders or the Equity Investor, as the case may be, or
otherwise cured in a timely manner by Parent to the satisfaction of the Lenders or Equity Investor, as the case may be. Parent or an Affiliate thereof, has
paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this
Agreement, and intend pay in full any other commitment fees and other fees required to be paid thereunder as and when they become due.
(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no (i) conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders or the Equity Investor
to provide the Financing or (ii) contingencies (including any condition or contingency relating to the availability of any “market flex” provisions) that
would permit the Lenders or the Equity Investor to change the total amount of the Financing or impose any additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent represents and warrants that there are no side letters or agreements or
understandings to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing that adversely affect
the availability of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters.
(d) As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, Parent has no reason to believe
that at the Closing, (i) the Financing, as contemplated by the Commitment Letters, will not be available to permit Parent to perform its obligations under
this Agreement (including all payments to be made by it in connection herewith) and (ii) Parent will not have immediately available funds in connection
with the Financing in an aggregate amount (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges
provided under the Debt Commitment Letter, and assuming that all rights to flex the terms of the Debt Financing are exercised to their maximum extent), to
enable Parent to (x) consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, including the
payoff, satisfaction and discharge and/or defeasance by Parent of the Existing Credit Agreement, the release of any guarantees relating thereto and the
release of any Liens or other security thereunder (the “Debt Payoff”) if so requested by Parent and (y) pay all related fees and expenses and undertake its
other obligations at Closing upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the “Required Amount”). Parent has not incurred any
obligation, commitment, restriction or other liability of any kind, and is not contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction or other
liability of any kind, in either case which would impair or adversely affect such resources, funds or capabilities.
(e) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent (both before and after giving effect to any “market flex” provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter)
does not know of any (i) event that would result in any material breach of, violation of, or constitute a material default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a material default) by Parent or Merger Sub under the Financing, (ii) reason that any of the
A-26
Table of Contents
conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date or (iii) reason to
believe that any of the Equity Investors or Lenders will not perform their respective funding obligations under the Commitment Letters in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent of any
other financing or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement be a condition to any of Parent’s obligations hereunder.
(f) The Equity Commitment Letters contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the
Equity Financing available to Parent on the terms set forth therein. The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent on the terms set forth therein.
(g) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company limited guarantees, each dated as of the date of this
Agreement (the “Limited Guarantees”) pursuant to which Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Fund XI, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, TPG
Partners VIII, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and TPG Healthcare Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Guarantors”), have guaranteed
their pro rata portion of the payment of (i) the Parent Termination Fee and the costs and expenses in connection with the enforcement thereof, in each
case to the extent such amount is due and payable pursuant to Section 8.5(d) and Section 8.5(f) and (ii) the expense obligations of Parent to the extent
due pursuant to Section 6.10(a)(i) and Section 6.10(a)(ii). The Limited Guarantees are in full force and effect and are valid and binding on the applicable
Guarantor and enforceable against the applicable Guarantor in accordance with its terms and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse

Table of Contents
with the intent to induce, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its
Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives to, immediately (1) cease and cause to be terminated any discussions and negotiations with any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and cease providing any information to any such Person or its Representative, (2) with respect to any Person

Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2, (i) provide access to non-public
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal; provided that such information has
previously been made available to Parent or is provided to Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following the time such
information is made available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such non-public information, the Company receives from the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the
Confidentiality Agreement’s terms are (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an
Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal if, and
only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, (1) the board of directors of the Company (acting on the recommendation of the
Transaction Committee) determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) based on the information then available and after
consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2) with respect to clause (ii) above, the Company provides written
notice to Parent at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to engaging or participating in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

Proposal or that could be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or that could be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including providing
copies of any written materials delivered by such Person) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms
of any such proposals or offers (including any material amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations (including delivery
to Parent within twenty-four (24) hours of copies of all communications delivered by or on behalf of such Person in connection with such proposal or
offer).

(d) No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as provided in Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f), neither the board of
directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, fail to recommend
against such Acquisition Proposal and, after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) days of receipt
of a written request from Parent to do so (and if the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within ten (10) days, then within two (2)
Business Days of such request), (iv) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (v) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement (each of the foregoing clauses (i)-(v), a “Change in Recommendation”) or (vi) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement or other
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(b) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a) and Section 6.2(b)) (an
“Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.
(e) Superior Proposal Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in Section 6.2(d), following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the date of this Agreement that did
not result from a breach in any material respect of this Section 6.2 and that the board of directors of the Company (acting on the recommendation of the
Transaction Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the board of directors of the Company (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) may, at any time prior to the time the Company
Requisite Vote is obtained, make a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.3(b) in order to enter into the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.2(e)(ii), or authorize, resolve, agree or propose
publicly to take any such action, if all of the following conditions are met:
(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a written
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration
offered therein and the identity of the Person or group making the Acquisition Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted
copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents (other than immaterial documents) related to the Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the board of directors of the Company (acting on the
recommendation of the Transaction Committee) has determined to make a Change in Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.3(b) in order to enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable and (B) prior to making such a Change in Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.3(b), as applicable, used commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to
the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such notice period, to consider any adjustments proposed in writing by Parent to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and
(ii) the board of directors of the Company (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed in writing by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in
Recommendation or to so terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.3(b), as applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement before this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with its terms.
(f) Intervening Event Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.2(d), upon the

describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Change in Recommendation and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii) below, the board
of directors of the Company (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) has determined to make a Change in Recommendation and (B)
prior to making such a Change in Recommendation, used reasonable best efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
engage) during such four (4) Business Day notice period to consider any adjustments proposed in writing by Parent to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that the failure of the board of directors of the Company to make a Change in Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in
accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
and
(ii) the board of directors of the Company (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed in writing by
Parent, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(g) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that this Section 6.2(g) shall not be deemed to permit the
Company or the board of directors of the Company to make a Change in Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.2(e) or Section 6.2(f).
6.3 Information Supplied; Schedule 13e-3. (a) The Company shall, as promptly as possible, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the date of this

“Proxy Statement”) in preliminary form relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to any comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the staff of the SEC (the “Staff”) advises that it has no further
comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.
(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate to, concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a
Rule 13e-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13e-3 (such transaction statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the “Schedule 13e-3”)
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(c) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (other than any filing, amendment or supplement in connection with a Change in Recommendation). The Company and
Parent shall (i) provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of the Schedule 13e-3 prior to filing the Schedule 13e-3 with the SEC and
(ii) consider in good faith all comments thereto reasonably proposed by the

amendments or supplements to the extent not readily publicly available. Parent shall (A) furnish all information required by the Exchange Act or
applicable Law to be included in the Proxy Statement concerning it and its Affiliates to the Company, (B) provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of information to be included therein and (C) otherwise reasonably assist and
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments received from the SEC. If at any time prior to
the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13e-3, as
applicable, such that the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13e-3 would not (1) include any misstatement of a material fact or (2) omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then
(x) the party that makes such discovery shall promptly notify the other party and (y) the Company shall prepare (with Parent’s reasonable assistance) and
file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC
or the Staff and of any request by the SEC or the Staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13e-3 or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the Staff,
on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13e-3 or the Merger. No response to any comments from the SEC or the Staff relating to
the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13e-3 will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon,
unless made pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company and Parent agree, as to
themselves and their Affiliates, that the Schedule 13e-3 will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.
6.4 Company Stockholders Meeting.
(a) The Company will, in coordination with Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Certificate
of Incorporation and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and use its reasonable best efforts to convene a meeting
of holders of Shares to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the “Company Stockholders Meeting”). Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.2, the board of directors of the Company shall (i) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) recommend at the Company
Stockholders Meeting that the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption.

represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may, in its reasonable
discretion, postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting in consultation
with Parent (provided that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting more than two months in the aggregate
pursuant to this sentence without Parent’s prior written consent (and in no event shall any such postponed or adjourned Company Stockholders
Meeting be held later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Termination Date). In addition, notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6.4(a),
the Company may (and if required by Parent on no more than two occasions, shall for a reasonable period of time not to exceed ten Business Days in the
aggregate) postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a manner suitable under applicable Law and reviewed by stockholders

of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted
on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed without the Parent’s prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by applicable Law.
(b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the
Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date, including (i) preparing and filing all documentation to effect
all necessary notices, reports and other filings (and in any event, by filing within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement the
notifications, filings and other information required to be filed under the HSR Act and as promptly as practicable in the case of all other filings required
under any other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby) and to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including those listed in
Section 7.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter), (ii) satisfying the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (iv) obtaining (and cooperating with
each other in obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with the Merger and (v) executing and delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
(b) Subject to Section 6.5(c), in the event that the parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws, including a request for additional information and documentary material (a “Second Request”), unless otherwise agreed to by Parent and
the Company, the parties will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second Request
as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process. None of
the parties, including their respective Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates, shall take, cause or permit to be taken, or omit to take, any action which such
party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties. In furtherance of the foregoing, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, neither CD&R nor TPG (solely with respect to the TPG
Capital platform) (each as defined below) shall directly or indirectly (but subject in all respects to the immediately succeeding sentence) acquire or agree
to acquire by merger or consolidation with, or by purchasing the assets of or equity in, any Person (a “Specified Acquisition”), if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such a Specified Acquisition would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay past the
Termination Date the satisfaction of the condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary the restrictions in the
foregoing sentence shall not apply to any existing portfolio

company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) of CD&R or TPG. None of the parties, without the other party’s prior
written consent, shall (i) withdraw or refile any filing made under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, (ii) enter into any timing, settlement or similar
agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would have the effect of extending, suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling the
expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the contemplated transactions under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or (iii) enter
into any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the
contemplated transactions (or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from consummating the contemplated transactions).
(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust Laws; however, after consulting with the Company, Parent shall have final
decision making authority with respect to the appropriate course of action with respect to obtaining the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period
expirations or authorizations of any Governmental Entity required to consummate the Merger prior to the Termination Date. No party hereto or its counsel
shall independently participate in any substantive call or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without first giving the other party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) each
party shall notify the other, as far in advance as practicable, of any filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries
intends to make with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Section 6.5, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing or
making any such communication or inquiry, such party shall provide the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall
consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing, communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the
submission of such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party with a copy of any such filing or, if in written form,
communication or inquiry, or a summary of any oral communication and (iv) consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry, hearing,
investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning for,
any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the Company and Parent each shall act
reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be reasonably
redacted as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns or to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law.
(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 6.5, Parent, including its Subsidiaries and controlled
Affiliates, hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection
with the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to avoid the entry of, or effect the
dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have
the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Section 6.5, “reasonable best efforts” shall
include taking any and all actions (such actions, the “Regulatory Actions”) necessary to obtain the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period
expirations or authorizations of any Governmental Entity required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as
expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date, including (A)(i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing
to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold separate, and other disposition of the businesses, assets,
properties, products, product lines, services or equity interests of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates, (ii)
creating, terminating, or amending any existing or new relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates, (iii) otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would limit Parent’s freedom of action with respect to the
operation of, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, properties, products, product lines, services or equity interests
of Parent or the Company (including any of their respective Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates), provided, that such Regulatory Actions shall be
conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the Effective Time; and (B) defending through
A-36

litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring prior to the Termination Date; provided that such litigation
in no way limits the obligation of Parent pursuant to the foregoing sentence.
(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 6.5, if any administrative or judicial Proceeding, including
any such Proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the Merger.
(f) Information. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the other party that is necessary
or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(g) Status. The Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of any notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.
(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.5 or any other provision of this Agreement shall require Merger
Sub, Parent or any of their Affiliates (including Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) and TPG Global, LLC (“TPG”) or any investment funds or
investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by, CD&R or TPG or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the
private equity industry) or investment of CD&R, TPG or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle) to, and the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, agree or otherwise be required to take any action (including any steps or actions contemplated by this Section 6.5) with
respect to CD&R, TPG or such Affiliates, other than with respect to Parent and/or its Subsidiaries.
6.6 Access; Consultation.
(a) Upon reasonable advance notice (and in any event not less than twenty-four (24) hours’ notice), and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, (x) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ directors, officers or employees to, and shall direct its
other Representatives to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ properties, assets, commitments, Tax Returns, Contracts, books and records and, (y) during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent all information concerning its or any of its
Subsidiaries’ capital stock, business and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the Merger; provided that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company; and provided,
further that the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any invasive environmental sampling or any inspection or to disclose any information
pursuant to this Section 6.6, to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company’s outside legal counsel, any applicable Law
requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information or disclosure thereof would expose the Company to an
unreasonable risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive personal information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, the information is
subject to
A-37
Table of Contents
confidentiality obligations to a third party or its disclosure would violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement or other Contract that is binding on
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) disclosure of any such information or document would result in the waiver or loss of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other legal privilege; provided, further that with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section
6.6(a), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any such third party to provide such disclosure, (2)
develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to the Company and (3) in the case of
clauses (i) and (iii), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis
for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction (solely to the extent necessary) or entry into a customary
joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure
of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by any such executive officer.
(b) Each of Parent and the Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate competitively sensitive material as “Outside
Counsel Only Material” or with similar restrictions. Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the
recipient, pursuant to the terms of an agreement with respect thereto on terms that are reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and pursuant to
which such information shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to any directors, officers or employees of the recipient without the express prior
permission of the Company or its legal counsel, and shall be subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. All
information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.6, including all information and/or discussions resulting from any access provided pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreements, which shall survive any termination of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.
(c) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 6.6 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened
legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters
and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way
the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All
such information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled
to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or the NASDAQ, (b) any
consultation that would not be reasonably practicable as a result of requirements of applicable Law, (c) any press release or public statement that in the

to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual (or shorter) cash bonus

Employees for their service recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting, continuous
service, determination of service awards, vacation, paid time off, and severance entitlements to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service
was credited under the Company Plans, provided that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and neither any current or former employee, nor any other
individual associated therewith, is or shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall be

judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Person
prior to the Effective Time, in each case, whether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under the Laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to
which such Person is a party, the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such
Person (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that the organizational documents
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, shall, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable,
in the aggregate, with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and
agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws (or equivalent
organizational and governing documents of any Subsidiary). Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not

liability insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); provided, however that in no event shall the Company be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in
excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to
obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such
six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this Agreement;
provided, however that in no event shall the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual
premium amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such

the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case as a condition thereto, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or their respective successors or assigns),
as applicable, shall cause such Person to assume (either by operation of law or by written instrument) all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under the
Laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the
Company Bylaws, and Parent acknowledges and agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities now
existing in favor of any Indemnified Party for actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.
(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding
for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such settlement, compromise or consent.
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to any directors’ and officers’ insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.11 is not prior to or in substitution for
any such claims under such policies.

of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

(i) negotiate definitive financing agreements with respect to the Financing (the “Definitive Financing Agreements”) on terms and conditions no less
favorable to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letters (including any “market flex” terms and conditions), provided, however, that in no
event shall any of the Definitive Financing Agreements (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing provided for in the Commitment Letters
(including by changing the amount of fees or original issue discount contemplated by the Commitment Letters) such that Parent would not have
sufficient cash proceeds to permit Parent to pay the Required Amount on the Closing Date; (B) expand the conditions or other contingencies relating to
the receipt or funding of the Financing beyond those expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, amend or modify any of such conditions or other
contingencies or impose any new or additional condition or other contingency relating to the receipt or funding of the Financing, in each case, in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) make the funding of the Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less
likely to occur or (y) materially delay or prevent the Closing; (C) contain terms (other than those terms expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters) that
could reasonably be expected to materially delay the Effective Time or the date on which the Financing would be obtained or make the timely funding of
the Financing less likely to occur; or (D) adversely impacts the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against any of the other parties to the
Commitment Letters or Definitive Financing Agreements;

detail with respect to the status of the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company and the Company’s legal counsel
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon drafts of all commitment letters and Definitive Financing Agreements, and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable comments and changes proposed on behalf of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and

aggregate funds that would be available to Parent at the Closing will be sufficient to pay the Required Amount) (the “Alternative Financing”); provided
that Parent shall not be required to arrange or obtain any Alternative Financing having terms and conditions (including “market flex” provisions), taken
as a whole, less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (after giving effect to any “market flex” provision applicable

more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing taken as a whole and (ii) if applicable, promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. To the extent applicable, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions described in any
New Commitment Letter. In the event Alternative Financing is obtained, references in this Agreement to the Financing shall also be deemed to refer to
such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in
connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements shall also
be deemed to refer to such commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 6.18 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations with respect to the
Financing.

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that each of the Parent Termination Fee and the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and
when required pursuant to this Section 8.5, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall either the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, on more than one occasion.
(f) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, no party would have

8.5(a), Section 8.5(b), Section 8.5(c) or Section 8.5(d) (any such amount due, a “Payment”), and, in order to obtain such Payment, Parent or the Company
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, respectively, for the applicable Payment, or any portion thereof, the party
with such judgment against them shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually incurred in connection with such
suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amount of the Payment, which shall accrue at the prime rate published in the Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such Payment was first required to be paid from such date through the date of full payment thereof;
provided in no event shall any Party be required to pay such costs, expenses and interest pursuant to this Section 8.5(f) in an aggregate amount that
exceeds $5,000,000.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the proviso in Section 8.5(a) and Section 9.13, in any circumstance in
which this Agreement is terminated and Parent has the right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance herewith, the payment of
the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(f) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons,

current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative, agent,
assignee or successor of any of the foregoing, and the Financing Sources (the “Parent Related Parties”) against the Company, its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or successors or any former, current or future general or limited
partner, stockholder, controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative, agent, assignee or successor of any of the
foregoing (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement, any certificate or other document
delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith,
and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement (except that the Company shall remain obligated to pay to Parent any amount due and payable pursuant to Section 8.5(f)), whether in equity
or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Section 9.13, in any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated
for any reason, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (if due) and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to Section 8.5(f)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties pursuant to this Agreement for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach of,
or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith (including the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Equity Commitment Letters) or otherwise or in respect of any representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement (except that the Parent shall remain obligated to pay to the Company any amount due and payable pursuant to Section 8.5(f)), whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company
under the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, nor limit the Company from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief
from or with respect to any Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, (A) neither Parent nor any Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement

Commitment Letters) or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination and (C) the Company shall cause any claim, suit, action or proceeding pending in connection with this Agreement
or any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith (including the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letters) or
therewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof), to the extent maintained by the
Company or any Company Related Party against Parent or any Parent Related Party, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five

Related Party, any damages from, or otherwise bring any suit, action or proceeding against, Parent or any Parent Related Party in connection with this
Agreement, the other transaction documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including any suit, action or proceeding relating to the

9.11 Interpretation.
(a) The table of contents and the Article, Section and paragraph headings or captions herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words “include”,
“includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”. The words “hereof”,
“herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The word “or” when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such term. Any Contract or Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Contract
or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts) by waiver or consent and (in the case of Laws) by
succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
(b) Any Contract or information referred to herein shall be deemed to have been “delivered”, “provided”, “furnished” or “made available” (or any phrase
of similar import) to Parent by the Company if such Contract or information was posted to the data room maintained by the Company in connection with
the transaction or otherwise provided directly (including through email) to Parent or any of its Representatives by 5:00 p.m. EST on the date of execution
and delivery of this Agreement. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of any such period is a day
other than a Business Day, the period in question shall end and any such step shall be taken by or on the next succeeding Business Day.
(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring
any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
9.12 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other parties
hereto, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may assign this
Agreement, in whole or in part, and any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its controlled Affiliates; provided, however,
that no such assignment shall release Parent from liability and obligation under this Agreement.
9.13 Specific Performance.
(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in
the event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the parties to this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It
A-57
Table of Contents
is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other party, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including
Section 6.5, and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this
Agreement, including ARTICLE I and ARTICLE III) by a decree of specific performance, in accordance with Section 9.5 of this Agreement, without the
necessity of proving actual harm or damages or posting a bond or other security therefor, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity, and each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing,
the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the
covenants required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (including Section 6.5, and including to cause Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including ARTICLE I and ARTICLE III) in
addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
ARTICLE VIII and seek money damages (including damages based on loss of the expected economic benefits of the transaction to the Company). Each
party further agrees that it shall not take any position in any legal proceeding concerning this Agreement that is contrary to the terms of this Section 9.13.
Parent shall cause Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.13(a) and subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.13(b), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters to
fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and consummate the Closing only in the event that (i) all conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2
have been satisfied or waived (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) and Parent fails to consummate the Merger on the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (ii) the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if Alternative Financing
is being used in accordance with Section 6.18(d), pursuant to the Alternative Financing commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has delivered an irrevocable notice that it is ready, willing and
able to consummate the Closing if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements for any Financing under the terms thereof, none of the Company and its
Affiliates and their direct and indirect equityholders shall be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any Financing
Source.
(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ right to seek specific performance pursuant to
this Section 9.13 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and/or pursue all
applicable remedies at law, including seeking payment of the Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or
any of its Affiliates be entitled to the Parent Termination Fee if they have been granted specific performance of this Agreement and the Closing actually
occurs.
9.14 No Recourse.
(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member,

incorporator, manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative,

party under this Agreement or for any Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, in each case other than in the
case of fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting the rights of the Company against (i) Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) any Person that is a
party to (and in accordance with the terms of) the Confidentiality Agreements and the Rollover and Support Agreement and (iii) against the Guarantors as
provided for in the Limited Guarantees, in no event shall the Company or any of its controlled Affiliates seek to recover monetary damages from any Non-
Recourse Party.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and its Affiliates shall not have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.14 shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations
of Parent or any of its Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Source’s obligations to Parent or any of its Affiliates under the Debt
Commitment Letter.

representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of the Company against the Stockholder, in no event shall

Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
21. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the

were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto may raise the use of an electronic delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an electronic delivery, as a defense to the formation of
a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-

Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst
reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by
the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of
the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
the Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the distribution, companion animal health, and
healthcare information technology industries and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors,
as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In

that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our
analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any
term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This
opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of
the $21.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address,
any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the
Transaction, whether relative to the $21.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the
Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of
volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or Parent, or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or
viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is
necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and
we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date
hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of
the Company and, with respect to such opinion, the Transaction Committee of the Board, in connection with their consideration of the Transaction and
such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter.
This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $21.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than
Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
Very truly yours,
(GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. LLC)
