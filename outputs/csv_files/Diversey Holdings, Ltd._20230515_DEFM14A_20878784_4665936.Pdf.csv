Platinum and who are not members of the Company’s management to, among other things, review, evaluate
and negotiate the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. The
Special Committee evaluated the Merger, in consultation with the Company’s management and its own
independent legal and financial advisors and considered various material factors. After careful consideration,
the Special Committee unanimously (i) determined that the Transactions, including the Merger Agreement,
the TRA Termination Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Limited Guarantee and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Unaffiliated
Shareholders, (ii) recommended that the Board approve, adopt and declare advisable the Merger Agreement
and cause the Company to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, (iii) recommended that the Board approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, the TRA Termination Agreement, the
Voting Agreement and the Limited Guarantee, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated thereby, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, (iv) recommended that the Board
direct that the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for
approval and (v) recommended that the Board resolve to recommend that the Company’s shareholders
authorize the Plan of Merger in accordance with the Company’s organizational documents and the CICA.
The Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously (i)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger
3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (ii)
approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the
Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the
terms and conditions set forth therein, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger be
submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Company’s
shareholders authorize the Plan of Merger in accordance with the Company’s organizational documents and
the CICA. Accordingly, the Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee,
unanimously recommends that holders of Ordinary Shares vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting.
For the factors considered by the Board and Special Committee in reaching its decision to approve and
recommend the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger, see “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger”
beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement.
The Board also unanimously recommends that holders of Ordinary Shares vote “FOR” the advisory and non-
binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger (Page 27)
As described above, the Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee, unanimously determined to approve and recommend the Merger Agreement and the Plan of
Merger. For a description of the Company’s purposes and reasons for the Merger, see “Special Factors-​
Reasons for the Merger.”
Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the Parent Entities and the Bain
Shareholder and certain of its affiliates are each an affiliate of the Company and engaged in a “going-private”
transaction for purposes of the Merger and, therefore, required to express their respective reasons for the
Merger and their respective beliefs as to the fairness of the going private transaction and the Merger to the
Company’s Unaffiliated Shareholders. For a description of the Parent Entities’ purposes and reasons for the
Merger and their beliefs as to the fairness of the going private transaction and the Merger to the Unaffiliated
Shareholders, see “Special Factors-Reasons of the Parent Entities for the Merger” and “Special Factors-
Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger,” respectively. For a description of the Bain
Shareholder’s purposes and reasons for the Merger and its beliefs as to the fairness of the going private
transaction and the Merger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders, see “Special Factors-​Reasons of the Bain
Shareholder for the Merger” and “Special Factors-Position of the Bain Shareholder as to the Fairness of the
Merger,” respectively.
Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor (Page 34, Annex G)
The Special Committee retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Special
Committee’s evaluation of the Merger. As part of this engagement, the Special Committee requested that
Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by
the holders of Ordinary Shares (other than holders of Bain Shares or Excluded Shares), a group of security
holders which the Special Committee considered to be situated substantially similarly to the security holders
unaffiliated with the Company generally. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on March 7, 2023,
Evercore rendered to the Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the
Merger Consideration of $8.40 per share to be received by the holders of Ordinary Shares in the Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than holders of Bain Shares or Excluded Shares).
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated March 7, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex G to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by
reference. The Company encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was
addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. Evercore’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the
Special Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including
4 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
as to how any holder of Ordinary Shares should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore’s opinion does not
address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available
to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.
See “Special Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 34 of
this proxy statement.
Certain Effects of the Merger (Page 46)
The Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company in accordance with the Plan of Merger, and the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the
Company will continue as the Surviving Company in the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (as
described under “Special Factors-Certain Effects of the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement-The Merger”).
If the Merger is completed, each Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and the Bain Shares) will automatically be cancelled and
exchanged into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, each Owned Company
Share will automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid
therefor and each Bain Share will automatically be cancelled and exchanged into the right to receive the Bain
Consideration. The Rollover Shares will be exchanged by the Bain Shareholder immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger for common and preferred units of Topco (or, in certain circumstances, common
units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco) in accordance with the terms of the Rollover
Agreement (such Rollover Shares being valued at an amount equal to $7.84 per Ordinary Share).
The Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share to be received by shareholders (other than the
Bain Shareholder) represents:
a premium of 41.2% over the $5.95 closing price per Ordinary Share on Nasdaq on March 7, 2023, the
trading day prior to the date of the execution of the Merger Agreement; and
a premium of 59.0% over the volume weighted average price per Ordinary Share on Nasdaq during the
90-day period ended on March 7, 2023.
The Bain Consideration of $7.84 per Ordinary Share to be received by the Bain Shareholder represents:
a premium of 31.8% over the $5.95 closing price per Ordinary Share on Nasdaq on March 7, 2023, the
trading day prior to the date of the execution of the Merger Agreement; and
a premium of 48.4% over the volume weighted average price per Ordinary Share on Nasdaq during the
90-day period ended on March 7, 2023.
The closing sale price of an Ordinary Share on Nasdaq on May 11, 2023 was $8.24. You are encouraged
to obtain current market quotations for an Ordinary Share in connection with voting your Ordinary Shares.
Upon the Closing, Ordinary Shares will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system
and will only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Bain Consideration (and, in the
case of the Rollover Shares, will be exchanged for common and preferred units of Topco (or, in certain
circumstances, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco)), as applicable (or if
you are entitled to and have properly exercised shareholder dissenter rights in accordance with Section 238
of the CICA, the fair value of your Ordinary Shares, together with interest, if any, on the amount determined
to be the fair value, subject to Section 238 of the CICA, as determined by the Grand Court of the Cayman
Islands). You will not own any shares of the Surviving Company. A copy of the Merger Agreement is
attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. A copy of the Plan of Merger is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement. Please read each carefully and in its entirety.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 51)
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Plan of
Merger and the Transactions, you should be aware that the Company’s executive officers and directors have
economic interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s
shareholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The Board was aware of
and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement
and the Merger and in reaching its decision to determine that the Transactions are in the best interests of the
Company and Unaffiliated Shareholders, and its decision to recommend that shareholders authorize the
Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions. These material interests are summarized below:
the executive officers and directors of Diversey hold equity-based awards that will be afforded the
treatment described under “Special Factors-Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards”;
the members of the Special Committee received cash fees in connection with their services to the
Company with respect to the Merger;
certain directors of Diversey are affiliated with the Bain Shareholder, which will receive different
consideration than the Unaffiliated Shareholders, as described under “Special Factors-Rollover
Agreement” and “Special Factors-Reasons of the Bain Shareholder for the Merger”;
the executive officers of Diversey are entitled to severance benefits pursuant to existing
arrangements or statutory requirements;
certain executive officers of Diversey may enter into letter agreements, acknowledging that they will
have “good reason” immediately following the Effective Time, such that if they were to terminate their
employment, they would be entitled to certain benefits described below under the section of this
proxy statement entitled “Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-​
Severance Entitlements”; and
6 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the executive officers and directors of Diversey are entitled to continued indemnification and
insurance coverage following the Merger under the Merger Agreement. Please see the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and
Insurance.”
Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 58)
The receipt of cash in exchange for Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders will generally recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the adjusted tax basis of the Ordinary Shares
surrendered. The tax consequences of the Merger to the Company’s shareholders will depend upon their
particular circumstances. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the Merger to them, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or foreign jurisdiction. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see
“Special Factors-Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on
page58 of this proxy statement.
Financing of the Merger (Page 60)
On March 8, 2023, Parent entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with each of the Platinum Entities,
pursuant to which the Platinum Entities have committed to, directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, capitalize Parent at the Closing with the Equity Financing. The Equity Financing is in
exchange, directly or indirectly, for equity securities of Parent or its affiliates, solely for the purpose of
funding, and to the extent necessary to fund, together with the net proceeds of the Debt Financing, all of the
amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with the Closing, including the aggregate consideration
payable under the Merger Agreement to the Diversey shareholders, together with related fees, costs and
expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company in connection with the
Transactions. The obligation of the Platinum Entities to make the Equity Financing is subject to (a) the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent and Merger Sub of all conditions precedent set forth in the Merger
Agreement and described under “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger” to Parent’s and Merger
Sub’s obligations to consummate the Closing (other than those conditions that are by their terms to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied), (b) the prior or
substantially simultaneous closing and funding of the Debt Financing, or the Debt Financing sources having
confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing) is capable of being
funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (c) the concurrent Closing.
The Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that the Company is an express third-party
beneficiary thereof in connection with the Company’s exercise of its rights related to specific performance
under the Merger Agreement. The Equity Commitment Letter provides that it may be amended in writing if
signed by the Company (with the prior approval of the Special Committee), the Platinum Entities and Parent,
provided that the Equity Commitment Letter may be amended by the Platinum Entities without written
consent of the Company to reflect any permitted assignment pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter.
The Lenders have agreed to provide the Borrower with the Debt Financing on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The obligations of the Lenders to provide the Debt
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to a number of customary conditions.
Limited Guarantee (Page 62)
In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on March 8, 2023, the Platinum Entities and the
Company executed the Limited Guarantee, pursuant to which the Platinum Entities have agreed to guarantee
the performance and discharge of the payment of the Parent Termination Fee of $125,000,000 (if required to
be paid under the terms of the Merger Agreement) and certain other costs, expenses and obligations of
Parent set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Rollover Agreement (Page 62)
On March 8, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Bain Shareholder
separately entered into the Rollover Agreement with Topco, pursuant to which (1) the Bain Shareholder has
7 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreed to, immediately prior to the Effective Time, contribute, transfer and assign all of its right, title and
interest in the Rollover Shares (such Rollover Shares being valued at an amount equal to the Bain
Consideration) to Topco (and, in certain circumstances, a subsidiary of Topco), and (2) Topco has agreed to
concurrently accept (or, if applicable, cause its subsidiary to accept) such Rollover Shares in exchange for
the issuance to the Bain Shareholder of certain common and preferred units of Topco (or, in certain
circumstances described in the following sentence, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a
subsidiary of Topco). Pursuant to the Rollover Agreement, at the joint election of Topco and the Bain
Shareholder, the parties may structure the exchange so that in lieu of Topco issuing preferred units to the
Bain Shareholder, the Bain Shareholder contributes, transfers and assigns a portion of the Rollover Shares to
a subsidiary of Topco in exchange for preferred interests in such subsidiary, in which case following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreement, the Bain Shareholder would
own common units of Topco and preferred interests in such subsidiary. The Rollover Shares represent
approximately 56.1% of the Ordinary Shares held by the Bain Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time (which amount is subject to increase up to approximately 61.5% if, prior to the Closing and pursuant to
the Rollover Agreement, Topco elects to cause the Bain Shareholder to contribute additional Ordinary Shares
in exchange for additional preferred units of Topco (or a subsidiary thereof)). The form of the Rollover
Agreement is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. See “Special Factors-Rollover Agreement”
beginning on page 62 of this proxy.
Tax Indemnity Agreement (Page 63)
On March 8, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, Holdings UK, Topco, the Bain Shareholder and BCPE Cayman, as representative to the
shareholders, entered into the Tax Indemnity Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Indemnity Agreement, and in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Rollover Agreement and TRA
Termination Agreement, the Bain Shareholder has agreed to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Topco and
its subsidiaries and affiliates (including Parent and the Surviving Company), and each of their respective
officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
against certain taxes and related losses (including interest and penalties) of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Bain Shareholder’s indemnity obligations pursuant to the foregoing will be 72% of such
taxes and losses, up to a limit of €200,000,000. The sole source of the indemnitees’ recovery under the Tax
Indemnity Agreement for these certain taxes and related losses is cash proceeds from distributions or
dispositions of common units of Topco received by the Bain Shareholder pursuant to the Rollover
Agreement. In addition, the Tax Indemnity Agreement provides that no payments have been made pursuant
to the Tax Receivable Agreement since January 1, 2023 (other than a certain payment disclosed therein) and
no payments will be made pursuant to such agreement after the date of the Merger Agreement. See “Special
Factors-Tax Indemnity Agreement,” beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement, for additional information.
A copy of the Tax Indemnity Agreement is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement.
TRA Termination Agreement (Page 63)
On March 8, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Holdings
UK and BCPE Cayman, entered into the Tax Receivable Termination Agreement, pursuant to which, among
other things, the parties agreed to terminate the Company’s existing Tax Receivable Agreement, with such
termination effective upon the consummation of the Merger. From and after the effective date of the TRA
Termination Agreement, no payments will be made to any person in respect of, or pursuant to, the Tax
Receivable Agreement. See “Special Factors-TRA Termination Agreement,” beginning on page 63 of this
proxy statement, for additional information. A copy of the TRA Termination Agreement is attached as Annex
F to this proxy statement.
Regulatory Approvals (Page 64)
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until, among other things, the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act have expired or been terminated and any applicable waiting periods,
together with any extensions thereof, and any applicable waiting periods, consents or approvals required
from any Governmental Authority as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter shall have expired, been
terminated or obtained.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 95)
The respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by
Parent and the Company where permissible pursuant to applicable law) on or prior to the Effective Time of
certain conditions, including, among other conditions, the following:
the Company’s receipt of the Requisite Shareholder Approval at the Special Meeting;
(i) the applicable waiting period (and any extensions thereof) under the HSR Act has expired or been
terminated (which waiting period expired on April 24, 2023 at 11:59 p.m. ET) and (ii) any applicable
waiting periods, and any extensions thereof, and consents or approvals required from any
Governmental Authority under applicable Antitrust Laws and Foreign Investment Laws (as specified
by the Company Disclosure Letter) (collectively, the “Regulatory Condition”);
no law, temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the
consummation of the Merger will be in effect, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been
enacted, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger, that in each case prohibits, makes
illegal, or enjoins the consummation of the Merger; and
the completion of Dutch works council consultation procedures.
Non-Solicitation; Superior Proposals; Diversey Board Recommendation (Pages 83 - 85)
Following the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company is generally prohibited from, among other things,
participating in discussions or negotiations relating to acquisition proposals with third parties. However, the
Company was permitted to engage in negotiations during the Fiduciary Out Period (which period expired on
April 19, 2023) with a third party making an unsolicited, written bona fide acquisition proposal if such
proposal was not the result of a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement
and the Board or Special Committee determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel) that such proposal constituted, or could be reasonably expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal (as described under “The Merger Agreement-Non-Solicitation”) and the failure to engage
in negotiations with such third party were reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Board’s or Special
Committee’s fiduciary duties, as applicable. No such proposals were received prior to the expiration of the
Fiduciary Out Period.
In addition, the Board generally is not permitted under the Merger Agreement to change its
recommendation in favor of the Merger Proposal. However, in certain circumstances, the Board is permitted
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change (as described under “The Merger Agreement-Diversey Board
Recommendation”) in response to certain unforeseen, intervening events or in response to an unsolicited
written bona fide acquisition proposal that the Board or Special Committee determines in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal if, in either case, the Board determines in good faith that the failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, has negotiated in good faith with
Parent for a period of five business days to make adjustments to the Merger Agreement so as to obviate the
need to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and, following the five-business-day period, the Board
or the Special Committee, as applicable, has determined that the failure of the Board or the Special
Committee, as applicable to change its recommendation would be inconsistent with the Board’s or the
Special Committee’s fiduciary duties, as applicable.
Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 97)
The Company (provided that such termination by the Company has been approved by the Special
Committee) and Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement by mutual written consent at any time before the
Effective Time of the Merger. In addition, either Parent or the Company (provided that such termination by
the Company has been approved by the Special Committee) may terminate the Merger Agreement at any time
before the Effective Time if:
any permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or
other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing consummation of the Merger is in

TABLE OF CONTENTS
effect, or any action has been taken by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that, in
each case, prohibits, makes illegal or otherwise restrains or enjoins the consummation of the Merger
and has become final and non-appealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate the Merger
Agreement has used its reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent pursuant to, resolve
or lift, as applicable, such injunction, action, statute, rule, regulation or order;
if the Merger has not been consummated by the Termination Date, provided that if all of the
conditions to the Closing, other than the Requisite Shareholder Approval Condition, the Regulatory
Condition and the Legal Restraint Condition (as described under “The Merger Agreement-​Conditions
to the Merger) (to the extent that the Legal Restraint Condition is in respect of a consent,
authorization or approval required under the Regulatory Condition), shall have been satisfied (or in
the case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing,
shall then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take place on such date) or waived, then
the Termination Date shall be automatically extended to March 8, 2024, and such date shall thereafter
be deemed to be the Termination Date), provided that a party may not seek to terminate the Merger
Agreement if such party’s action or failure to act (which action or failure to act constitutes a breach
of the Merger Agreement by such party) has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, either
(A) the failure to satisfy the conditions to such party’s obligation to consummate the Merger or (B)
the Termination Date occurring before the Effective Time; or
if the Company fails to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Approval at the Special Meeting; provided
that a party may not seek to terminate the Merger Agreement if such party’s action or failure to act
(which action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the Merger Agreement by such party) has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Approval.
In addition, Parent and the Company have the right in certain circumstances to unilaterally terminate the
Merger Agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement.”
Termination Fees and Expenses (Page 98)
The Company has agreed to pay Parent $92,000,000 in cash upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement under certain circumstances. Parent has agreed to pay the Company $125,000,000 in cash upon
the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances.
Except as expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.
Dissenting Shareholder Rights Under the Companies Act (2023) Revision of the Cayman Islands (Page 111)
Under Cayman Islands law, if the Merger is completed, shareholders who provide written objection to
the Merger before the vote at the Special Meeting to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger
and the Transactions and who thereafter perfect and do not withdraw their dissent will have the right to be
paid the fair value of their shares of the Company, as ultimately determined by the Grand Court of the
Cayman Islands, provided that they comply with all requirements of Section 238 of the CICA. Dissenters’
rights are available only to registered holders of Ordinary Shares. Section 238 of the CICA is attached as
Annex H to this proxy statement. Please read it carefully and in its entirety.
Litigation Related to the Merger (Page 64)
Between April 20, 2023 and May 4, 2023, the Company received four demand letters (the “Demand
Letters”), each from a purported shareholder of the Company alleging to have identified materially misleading
and incomplete statements in the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on April 11, 2023.
One of the Demand Letters from a purported Company shareholder includes a draft complaint, which
names the Company and its directors as defendants. The draft complaint alleges, among other things, that
the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with
the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and
10 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The potential plaintiff seeks as relief, among other things, injunctive
relief preventing defendants from filing a definitive proxy statement and from consummating the Merger
unless additional disclosures are made, rescission of the Merger in the event the Merger is consummated or
awarding of rescissory damages and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’
and experts’ fees and expenses.
The Company believes the claims asserted in the draft complaint and the Demand Letters are without
merit. Additional demand letters or lawsuits relating to the Merger may also be received and/or filed in the
future.

The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. If the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company’s shareholders and the other
conditions to Closing under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, will be
merged with and into the Company. The Company will be the Surviving Company in the Merger and will
continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
What will happen to the Company generally as a result of the Merger?
If the Merger is completed, the Company will cease to be an independent public company and will be
wholly owned by Parent. As a result, you will no longer have any ownership interest in the Company.
Upon Closing, Ordinary Shares will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system,
including Nasdaq. In addition, following the Closing, the registration of Ordinary Shares and the
Company’s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, will be terminated.
What will happen to Ordinary Shares as a result of the Merger?
If the Merger is completed, each Ordinary Share (other than the Excluded Shares and the Bain Shares)
that you hold immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and exchanged into the right to
receive $8.40 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Bain Shares
will be cancelled and exchanged into the right to receive $7.84 in cash, without interest and subject to
any applicable withholding taxes. The Rollover Shares will be exchanged by the Bain Shareholder
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger for common and preferred units of Topco (or, in
certain circumstances, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco) in

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER, THE PLAN OF MERGER 
AND THE SPECIAL MEETING
The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the
Merger Agreement, the Merger, the Plan of Merger and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers

additional information, please refer to the more detailed discussion contained elsewhere or incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in
this proxy statement.
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card in connection with the solicitation of proxies by
the Board because you were a shareholder of Diversey as of May 11, 2023, the record date for the
Special Meeting which is being held in connection with the proposed Merger. To complete the Merger,
the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of Ordinary Shares present
and voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is required. A copy of the
Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, and a copy of the Plan of Merger is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The Merger Agreement calls for the Plan of Merger and
other documents required under the CICA to effect the Merger to be filed with the Registrar of
Companies of the Cayman Islands as provided by Section 233 of the CICA. The Company will submit
the Merger Proposal to its shareholders for approval at the Special Meeting described in this proxy
statement. For more information, please read the section entitled “The Special Meeting” beginning on
page 67 of this proxy statement. You are also being asked to vote to approve the advisory and non-
binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
This proxy statement and the related Schedule 13E-3, each of which you should read carefully, contain
important information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Special
Meeting and the matters to be voted on thereat. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to
vote your Ordinary Shares without attending the Special Meeting and to ensure that your Ordinary
Shares are represented and voted at the Special Meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are encouraged to
submit a proxy as soon as possible.
What is the proposed transaction?
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. If the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company’s shareholders and the other
conditions to Closing under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, will be
merged with and into the Company. The Company will be the Surviving Company in the Merger and will
continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
What will happen to the Company generally as a result of the Merger?
If the Merger is completed, the Company will cease to be an independent public company and will be
wholly owned by Parent. As a result, you will no longer have any ownership interest in the Company.
Upon Closing, Ordinary Shares will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system,
including Nasdaq. In addition, following the Closing, the registration of Ordinary Shares and the
Company’s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, will be terminated.
What will happen to Ordinary Shares as a result of the Merger?
If the Merger is completed, each Ordinary Share (other than the Excluded Shares and the Bain Shares)
that you hold immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and exchanged into the right to
receive $8.40 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Bain Shares
will be cancelled and exchanged into the right to receive $7.84 in cash, without interest and subject to
any applicable withholding taxes. The Rollover Shares will be exchanged by the Bain Shareholder
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger for common and preferred units of Topco (or, in
certain circumstances, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco) in

accordance with the terms of the Rollover Agreement (such Rollover Shares being valued at an amount
equal to $7.84 per Ordinary Share). This does not apply to Ordinary Shares held by any shareholders
who are entitled to and who have properly demanded and perfected their dissention rights in
accordance with Section 238 of the CICA as more fully described in the section entitled “Dissenting
Shareholder Rights under the Companies Act (2023 Revision) of the Cayman Islands” beginning on

Ordinary Shares subject to Diversey equity awards will be cancelled at the effective time of the Merger
in exchange for, (i) in the case of stock options, no consideration, (ii) in the case of restricted stock and
certain restricted stock units, the right to receive the merger consideration of $8.40 in cash per each
Ordinary Share subject to such Diversey equity award without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding taxes, or (iii) in the case of certain other restricted stock units, cash-settled awards subject
to certain service-based vesting conditions following the effective time of the Merger. The treatment of
Diversey equity awards is more fully described in the section entitled “Special Factors-Treatment of
Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity Awards” beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement.
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
We currently expect the Merger to be completed in the second half of 2023. However, the Merger is
subject to various closing conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approvals, and it is possible
that the failure to timely meet these Closing conditions or other factors outside of the Company’s
control could delay the Closing. The Company cannot assure you that it will complete the Merger on
this schedule or at all.
When and where will the Special Meeting be held?
The Special Meeting will be held on June 8, 2023 starting at 10:00 a.m., ET, at the Company’s offices at
1300 Altura Road, Suite 125, Fort Mill, South Carolina 29708.
What are the proposals that will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
You will be asked to consider and vote upon (1) the Merger Proposal and (2) the advisory and non-
binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
The Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously
determined that the Transactions are in the best interests of the Company. Thus, the Board, based in
part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously recommends that you
vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. For more information, read the section entitled “Special Factors-​
Recommendation of the Diversey Board of Directors and Special Committee” beginning on page 27 of
this proxy statement. The Board also unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the advisory and
non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
What happens if the Merger is not completed for any reason?
If the Merger is not completed for any reason, shareholders will not receive any payment for their
Ordinary Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain a stand-alone public
company, and Ordinary Shares will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq. Under specified
circumstances, the Company may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, as described under “The
Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement.
What will happen if shareholders do not approve the Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation
Proposal?
The approval of the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation
Proposal is not a condition to the Closing. The vote on this proposal by ordinary resolution is an
advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Parent. If the Merger Proposal is approved by
the shareholders and completed, the Merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company’s

named executive officers even if shareholders do not approve the advisory and non-binding Named
Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
Who is entitled to attend and vote at the Special Meeting?
The record date for the Special Meeting is May 11, 2023. If you are the record owner of Ordinary Shares
as of the close of business on the record date, you are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special
Meeting. As of the record date, there were 324,579,219 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding held
collectively by approximately 27 shareholders of record. If your Ordinary Shares are held through a
brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, you must obtain and present a proxy from your brokerage firm,
bank or other nominee in order to attend and vote your Ordinary Shares in person at the Special
Meeting.
What is the vote required to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions?
Under Cayman Islands law, the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of
Ordinary Shares present and voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is
required to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions.
Are there any shareholders who have already committed to vote in favor of the Merger?
Yes, the Bain Shareholder, the Company’s controlling shareholder and an entity advised by Bain Capital
Private Equity, LP, which held approximately 73.0% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares as of May 11,
2023, executed the Voting Agreement with the Company and Parent, pursuant to which the Bain
Shareholder agreed, among other things and subject to certain limitations, to vote all Ordinary Shares
owned or acquired by it prior to the record date in favor of the Merger Proposal. If the Bain Shareholder
votes in compliance with its obligations under the Voting Agreement, the Requisite Shareholder
Approval is assured. See “Special Factors-Voting Agreement,” on page 62 for additional information.
How are votes counted?
Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed by the Company for the Special Meeting.
For each of the Special Meeting proposals, you may vote “FOR”, “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN”.
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes
cast by the holders of Ordinary Shares present and voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at
the Special Meeting. The approval of the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-
Related Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a simple majority of the votes
cast by the holders of Ordinary Shares present and voting in person or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. If you (i) attend the Special Meeting in person or by proxy and abstain
from voting, the effect will be, among other things, that your shares will count towards quorum at the Special
Meeting, but will not count as a vote cast at the Special Meeting or (ii)(a) fail to submit a proxy over the Internet,
by telephone, by mail or otherwise fail to attend the Special Meeting and cast your vote in person or (b) fail to give
voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, your shares will not count towards quorum at
the Special Meeting, and if a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of any of the Special Meeting
proposals.
What is a quorum?
A quorum will be present if holders of a simple majority of the Ordinary Shares outstanding and entitled
to vote are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Given that the Bain
Shareholder owns greater than 50% of the Ordinary Shares, the general meeting will be quorate unless
the Bain Shareholder or its successors and assigns or affiliates are not in attendance.
If you mark, validly sign, date and return a proxy card (or otherwise properly submit a proxy over the
Internet or by telephone) but abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals
listed on the proxy card, your Ordinary Shares will be counted for purpose of determining whether a
quorum is present at the Special Meeting.
If your Ordinary Shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee and you do not obtain
a proxy from your broker or other nominee and attend the Special Meeting in person, or do not

instruct the nominee how to vote your Ordinary Shares, these Ordinary Shares will not be voted at the
Special Meeting, nor will they be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for
the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.
What do I need to do now?
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, including the
annexes and the other documents referred to in this proxy statement, please vote your Ordinary Shares
as described below. You have one vote for each Ordinary Share you own as of the record date.
How do I vote if I am a shareholder of record?
You may:
submit a proxy by telephone by calling the toll-free telephone number printed on your proxy card and
following the telephone voting instructions printed;
submit a proxy over the Internet at the URL listed on your proxy card and following the Internet
voting instructions;
submit a proxy by marking, validly signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and each additional
proxy card you receive from the Company and returning each proxy card in its accompanying
postage-paid envelope; or
vote your Ordinary Shares by appearing and casting your vote in person at the Special Meeting.
If you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, your voting instructions must be
received by 11:59 p.m. ET on June 7, 2023.
Submitting a proxy by telephone over the Internet, or by mail will not prevent you from voting in person
at the Special Meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail
even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your Ordinary Shares are
represented at the Special Meeting.
If you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to
have your Ordinary Shares voted, your Ordinary Shares will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal and
“FOR” the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Special Meeting, Ordinary Shares
represented by proxies received by the Company will be voted with respect to such matter in
accordance with the judgment of the persons named in the proxies.
How do I vote if my Ordinary Shares are held by my brokerage firm, bank or other nominee?
If your Ordinary Shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust,
then the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee is considered to be the shareholder of record with
respect to those Ordinary Shares. However, you still are considered to be the beneficial owner of those
Ordinary Shares, with your Ordinary Shares being held in “street name.” “Street name” holders cannot
vote their Ordinary Shares directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee
how to vote their Ordinary Shares. Your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee will only be permitted to
vote your Ordinary Shares for you at the Special Meeting if you instruct it how to vote. If you wish to
vote your Ordinary Shares held in “street name” in person at the Special Meeting, you must obtain and
present a valid proxy from your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee authorizing you to vote such
Ordinary Shares at the Special Meeting. Failure to obtain a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank or
other nominee authorizing you to vote at the Special Meeting and to instruct your brokerage firm, bank
or other nominee how to vote your Ordinary Shares will cause your shares to not count towards quorum
at the Special Meeting, and if a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of any of the
Special Meeting proposals.
In addition, because any Ordinary Shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a
different shareholder than any Ordinary Shares you hold of record, Ordinary Shares held by such
nominee will not be combined for voting purposes with Ordinary Shares you hold of record. To be

TABLE OF CONTENTS
sure your Ordinary Shares are represented and voted at the Special Meeting, you should instruct your
brokerage firm, bank or other nominee on how to vote your Ordinary Shares held in “street name.”
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy?
If you receive more than one proxy, it means that you hold Ordinary Shares that are registered in more
than one account. For example, if you own your Ordinary Shares in various registered forms, such as
jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will
need to mark, validly sign, date and return, a separate proxy card for those Ordinary Shares because
they are held in a different form of record ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your Ordinary
Shares are voted, you will need to mark, validly sign, date and return each proxy card you receive or
submit a proxy by telephone or over the Internet for each proxy card you receive by using the different
control number(s) on each proxy card.
May I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have delivered my proxy?
Yes. If you are a shareholder of record of Ordinary Shares, you have the right to change or revoke your
proxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting:
by delivering to the Company’s Secretary a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later
than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked;
by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by
itself, revoke your proxy; you must also vote in person at the Special Meeting);
by signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same Ordinary Shares and bearing a later date;
or
by submitting a new proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 11:59 p.m. ET on June 7, 2023.
Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of any proxies
should be addressed to:
Diversey Holdings, Ltd. 
1300 Altura Road, Suite 125 
Fort Mill, South Carolina, 29708 
Attention: Secretary
If you hold your Ordinary Shares through a brokerage firm, a bank or other nominee, you should contact
your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to change or revoke your
voting instructions.
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me?
The receipt of cash in exchange for Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your Ordinary
Shares. If you are a U.S. Holder, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain
recognized in connection with the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on
your particular circumstances, including but not limited to the application of federal non-income, state,
local and non-U.S. tax laws. You should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will
affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see “Special Factors-
Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 58 of this
proxy statement.
Am I entitled to dissenter rights?
Under Cayman Islands law, if the Merger is completed, shareholders who provide written objection to
the Merger before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting to authorize the Merger Agreement, the
Plan of Merger and the Transactions and who thereafter perfect and do not withdraw their dissent will
have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares as ultimately determined by the Grand Court of the
Cayman Islands, provided that they comply with all of the requirements of CICA as
16 
Q: 
A: 
Q:

Q: 
A: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
described in the section entitled “Dissenting Shareholder Rights under the Companies Act (2023
Revision) of the Cayman Islands” beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement. This fair value amount
could be more than, the same as or less than the per share Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary
Share payable to the Company’s shareholders (other than the Bain Shareholder) pursuant to the terms
of the Merger Agreement. Dissenters’ rights are available only to registered holders of shares. A copy
of the full text of Section 238 is attached as Annex H to this proxy statement.
These procedures are complex and you should consult your Cayman Islands legal counsel if you are
considering exercising such rights. If you do not fully and precisely satisfy the procedural requirements
of the CICA, you will lose your right to dissent.
What happens if I sell my Ordinary Shares before the Special Meeting?
The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the
Special Meeting and the expected Closing Date of the Merger. If you transfer your Ordinary Shares after
the record date but before the Special Meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain
your right to vote at the Special Meeting but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration
or Bain Consideration, as applicable, to the person to whom you transferred your Ordinary Shares.
In addition, if you sell your Ordinary Shares prior to the Special Meeting or prior to the Effective Time,
you will not be eligible to exercise dissenter rights with respect to those Ordinary Shares in respect of
the Merger. For a more detailed discussion of dissenter rights and the requirements for perfecting your
dissenter rights, see “Dissenting Shareholder Rights under the Companies Act (2023 Revision) of the
Cayman Islands” beginning on page 111 and Annex H of this proxy statement.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or
more shareholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the applicable
shareholder provides advance notice and follows certain procedures.
In such cases, each shareholder continues to receive a separate notice of the Special Meeting and proxy
card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of Ordinary
Shares held through such firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Ordinary Shares, you may
have already received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly
if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange
for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You
may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies. See
“Householding” on page 117 of this proxy statement.

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the
Merger Agreement. This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the
Board, the Special Committee, the representatives of the Company or the Special Committee, or other
parties, including Platinum and the Bain Shareholder.
As a matter of course and in their ongoing focus on enhancing shareholder value, the Board and the
Company’s management, at times with the assistance of outside advisors, have regularly reviewed and
evaluated the Company’s business plan and strategy, taking into account the changing developments,
trends, risks and conditions affecting the business and its industry generally. The Board and Company
management conduct such review in coordination with the Bain Shareholder, the majority owner of the
Company’s outstanding Ordinary Shares since its IPO in 2021, and its affiliates. The Bain Shareholder
currently owns approximately 73.0% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares. Since the Company’s initial public
offering (the “IPO”), the Bain Shareholder and its affiliates have also continually reviewed, considered and
evaluated the Bain Shareholder’s ongoing investment in the Company, how to maximize its value and
potential options with respect thereto.
On July 6, 2021, Platinum announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Solenis.
Following this acquisition, representatives of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder had several informal
discussions about the possible strategic benefits of a potential business combination between the Company
and Solenis. None of these conversations involved specific discussions of potential transaction terms or
transaction structure and no proposals were made by either party.
On February 15, 2022, Ken Hanau, a member of the Board nominated by the Bain Shareholder, and John
Panichella, CEO of Solenis, had lunch. During the course of that meeting Mr. Panichella gave an overview of
Solenis to Mr. Hanau, and they discussed a potential combination of Solenis and the Company. Prior to this
meeting, Mr. Panichella sent materials introducing Solenis to Mr. Hanau and the potential benefits of a
strategic transaction involving Solenis and the Company. These materials were discussed in greater detail
during the course of the February 15 meeting. No specific terms of a potential transaction were discussed in
connection with this meeting and no proposals were made by either party.
On March 24, 2022, representatives of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder met via telephone to discuss
the feasibility of a potential transaction involving the Company. No specific terms of such a potential
transaction were discussed and no proposals were made by either party.
On June 29, 2022, representatives of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder met over dinner to further
discuss the feasibility of a potential transaction involving the Company. Although specific economic terms
were not discussed, possible transaction structures were discussed in general terms. No proposals were
made by either party.
On August 3, 2022, the Company received a letter from Platinum and Solenis (the “August 3 Letter”)
setting forth, on a non-binding basis, Platinum’s and Solenis’ interest in pursuing a take-private acquisition
of the Company and a subsequent combination of the Company with Solenis at a price of $11.00 per Ordinary
Share, in cash, subject to a number of terms and conditions. The August 3 Letter contemplated that one or
more of the Company’s largest shareholders would invest in the transaction.
On August 8, 2022, the Board met via videoconference to consider the August 3 Letter and authorized
the management of the Company to explore with Platinum and Solenis the potential synergies that could
result from an acquisition of the Company by Platinum and Solenis in order to facilitate an evaluation of a
potential transaction by Platinum and the Bain Shareholder. The Board also authorized the management of
the Company to provide Platinum and Solenis with certain due diligence information regarding the Company,
as requested by Platinum and Solenis. The Board discussed that it would form a special committee to
evaluate the transaction at an appropriate time, if the potential transaction involved a rollover of a portion of
the Bain Shareholder’s investment in the Company such that the Bain Shareholder would continue to be a
shareholder of the combined entity. Representatives of the Bain Shareholder indicated to the Board that they
were evaluating their interest in the potential investment contemplated by Platinum’s and
18 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Solenis’ letter, understanding that such investment by the Bain Shareholder might be necessary to facilitate
the financing of the potential transaction. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell
Lipton”) also participated in the meeting at the invitation of Eric Foss, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board,
with the expectation that in the event that a special committee were to be formed, Wachtell Lipton could be
engaged as such committee’s legal advisor. Representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“K&E”) also
participated in the meeting, as counsel to the Company and the Bain Shareholder. Representatives of
Wachtell Lipton and K&E discussed the Board’s fiduciary duties and obligations in connection with a
potential sale of the Company and discussed certain potential conflicts of interest that could arise in
connection with the exploration of a potential sale. On August 12, 2022, the Company entered into a non-
disclosure agreement with Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (an affiliate of Platinum), Solenis and Bain Capital
Private Equity, L.P.
Throughout August and September of 2022, the Company, the Bain Shareholder, Platinum and Solenis
continued to discuss a potential transaction, and Platinum and Solenis conducted due diligence on the
Company, including, among other things, access to a virtual dataroom. To assist with these activities, the
Company informally engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”) as financial advisor to the
Company in connection with the potential transaction, with the understanding that a formal engagement
letter would be negotiated and executed in the future. J.P. Morgan was selected to act as financial advisor to
the Company due to its familiarity with the Company (including acting as a lead underwriter on the
Company’s IPO), and its experience, expertise and qualifications in advising companies on M&A
transactions. The Bain Shareholder and Platinum also jointly engaged FTI Consulting, Inc., (“FTI”) to
prepare a report on potential synergies that could result from the proposed combination of the Company and
Solenis.
On September 15 and 16, 2022, representatives of Platinum, the Bain Shareholder, Solenis, J.P. Morgan
and the Company participated in a series of management presentations and Q&A sessions at the Bain
Shareholder’s offices in New York, including reviews of the Company’s 3-year business plan and FTI’s initial
assessment of the potential synergies resulting from the proposed combination of the Company and Solenis,
all as part of the ongoing due diligence process.
On September 26, 2022, representatives of Platinum informed representatives of the Board that, in light
of financing and other market conditions, as well as the Company’s earnings results and downward pressure
on its trading price, Platinum and Solenis would be unable to proceed with the transaction on the terms
contemplated by the August 3 Letter. All parties agreed that FTI should nevertheless continue in its next
phase of diligence and prepare a more detailed assessment of potential synergies of the proposed
transaction.
On October 5, 2022, the Board and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and K&E met via videoconference
and the Board authorized the Company to allow Platinum and Solenis to continue conducting due diligence
and approved site visits by FTI. Over the next several weeks, FTI conducted site visits, met with
management teams of both companies and prepared its report with respect to these potential synergies.
On November 21, 2022, representatives of Platinum, the Bain Shareholder, Solenis and the Company met
via videoconference to review FTI’s more detailed report on potential synergies resulting from the proposed
combination of the Company and Solenis. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed and no
proposals were made by either party.
On December 7, 2022, representatives of Platinum, the Bain Shareholder and Solenis met to discuss
updates on Solenis and the Company. Platinum expressed a desire to restart discussions regarding a
potential transaction and subsequent combination of Solenis and the Company. Representatives from the
various parties corresponded over the subsequent two weeks regarding potential financing structures given
capital market dislocation, including the amount and structure of a potential rollover of a portion of the
Ordinary Shares held by the Bain Shareholder into the combined company in order to facilitate a transaction.
Representatives of the Bain Shareholder indicated that they would consider such potential rollover
investment if it was useful to facilitate a potential transaction and discussed that it may be beneficial to
enhance cash consideration to the Unaffiliated Shareholders.
During December, representatives of the Bain Shareholder and Platinum had several discussions to
explore and negotiate the terms of a potential rollover of a portion of the Bain Shareholder’s investment into
the combined company so that Platinum could secure financing for a revised proposal.

On December 14, 2022, representatives of the Bain Shareholder met with the Board and informed the
Board that they expected Platinum to restart discussions with respect to a potential transaction and that a
revised offer from Platinum to the Board might be received shortly.
On December 23, 2022, representatives of Platinum informed representatives of the Bain Shareholder
that they were working towards presenting a proposal to the Company for $7.50 per Ordinary Share in cash.
On January 11, 2023, the Company received an updated proposal from Platinum and Solenis (the
“January 11 Letter”) setting forth, on a non-binding basis, Platinum’s and Solenis’ interest in pursuing a
revised take-private acquisition of the Company and subsequent combination of the Company and Solenis at
a price of $7.50 per Ordinary Share, in cash. The January 11 Letter contemplated that the Bain Shareholder
would rollover a portion of the Ordinary Shares owned by it into the combined entity, and indicated that the
Bain Shareholder would be expected to execute a voting agreement in connection with the proposed
transaction.
On January 14, 2023, the Board, with certain members of management in attendance, held a meeting via
videoconference to discuss the January 11 Letter and to consider the formation of a Special Committee
consisting of directors of the Company who are not directly or indirectly affiliated with, and who are
otherwise independent from, the Bain Shareholder and Platinum and who are not members of the Company’s
management to evaluate the January 11 Letter, consider the Transactions and provide a recommendation to
the Board. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton, which would be retained by the Special Committee as its
counsel upon its formation, and K&E were present and discussed certain legal matters with the Board,
including fiduciary duty and process considerations. Following that presentation, the Board approved the
formation of the Special Committee, consisting of Messrs. Selim Bassoul, Juan R. Figuereo, Eric Foss (as
Chairman), Rodney Hochman and Ms. Katherine S. Zanotti, each of whom the Board determined were not
members of Company management and were unaffiliated, directly or indirectly, and were otherwise
independent from, the Bain Shareholder and from Platinum. The Board delegated to the Special Committee
full power and authority to:
review and to evaluate the terms and conditions, and to determine the advisability of, the
Transactions;
negotiate with Platinum, Solenis and the Bain Shareholder (or any other party the Special Committee
deemed appropriate) with respect to the terms and conditions of the Transactions and, if the Special
Committee deemed appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve and
recommend the execution and delivery of agreements in connection with the Transactions on behalf
of the Company;
determine whether the Transactions negotiated by the Special Committee are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its shareholders, including the Unaffiliated Shareholders, with the
instruction that the Special Committee would have no duty to consider the interests of the Bain
Shareholder as the controlling shareholder of the Company;
solicit the views of the Company’s executive, financial, and other officers regarding the terms and
conditions of the Transactions and on any reports, studies or similar information pertaining to the
Transactions provided to the Special Committee by advisors or agents retained by the Special
Committee; and
recommend to the full Board what action, if any, should be taken by the Board with respect to the
Transactions (including recommending not to pursue the Transactions) and confirmed that the Board
would not approve the Transactions without a prior favorable recommendation of the Special
Committee.
The Board also authorized the Special Committee to retain, at the Company’s expense, the Special
Committee’s own legal and financial advisors to assist the Special Committee. The Special Committee
confirmed its retention of Wachtell Lipton as its legal advisor and agreed to hold an initial meeting in the
coming days to discuss additional next steps.
On January 16, 2023, the Company shared a draft version of its “5 Year Plan” with the Bain Shareholder
as part of the Company’s typical planning and budgeting process. The 5 Year Plan included prospective
financial information for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 through the fiscal year ending December
31,
20 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2027, and is the basis of the Management Projections (as defined in the section entitled “Management
Projections” beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement). The draft 5 Year Plan was also shared with J.P.
Morgan later that week, and continued to be updated by the Company over the next several days.
On January 17, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting via videoconference with representatives of
Wachtell Lipton in attendance to discuss general transaction process considerations and next steps,
including selection of a financial advisor. The representatives of Wachtell Lipton also discussed certain legal
matters with the Special Committee at this meeting, including with respect to the fiduciary duties of directors
under the circumstances regarding the Transactions. Also during this meeting, the Special Committee
discussed with Wachtell Lipton potential financial advisors the Special Committee could consider retaining
in connection with the Transactions, and requested that Wachtell Lipton request certain information from,
and set up interviews with, certain potential financial advisors.
On January 21, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting via videoconference with representatives of
Wachtell Lipton and certain members of Company management in attendance to interview several financial
advisors, including Evercore, and reviewed information regarding each such financial advisor’s expertise,
experience, qualifications, and any existing or prior relationships with the Company, Platinum, Solenis or the
Bain Shareholder. In connection with its review, the Special Committee and Wachtell Lipton discussed and
reviewed Evercore’s relationship disclosure letter made available to the Special Committee prior to the
meeting. The Special Committee and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed certain of Evercore’s prior
relationships with Bain Capital Private Equity L.P. and Platinum that had been disclosed, as further described
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Special Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial
Advisor.” The Special Committee reviewed the disclosures and determined that none of the disclosed
relationships would impact Evercore’s ability to act in an independent and disinterested manner in rendering
their services to the Special Committee in connection with the potential transaction. Considering this, among
other factors, the Special Committee selected Evercore as its financial advisor, began to review the terms of
Evercore’s engagement with the assistance of Wachtell Lipton and instructed representatives of Evercore to
begin engaging with the management of the Company with respect to its information review and financial
analysis process. The Special Committee and Wachtell Lipton proceeded to negotiate the terms of the
Evercore engagement with representatives of Evercore over the next ten days.
On January 22, 2023, at the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore delivered
Evercore’s initial information review request list to the management of the Company. Company management
and representatives of Evercore also engaged in a videoconference to coordinate Evercore’s information
review process. From this time through the execution of the Merger Agreement, in response to requests from
representatives of Evercore on behalf of the Special Committee, the Company provided representatives of
Evercore with updated information on an iterative basis as requested by representatives of Evercore.
On January 24, 2023, the Company provided the Management Projections to the Special Committee and
the Special Committee directed Evercore to use such information in connection with performing certain of its
financial analyses in connection with its opinion. The Management Projections were also posted to the
virtual dataroom for review by Platinum and Solenis.
On January 25, 2023, the Company informally engaged Centerview Partners LLC (“Centerview”) as an
additional financial advisor to the Company in connection with the proposed Transactions, with the
understanding that a formal engagement letter would be negotiated and executed in the future. Centerview
was selected to act as financial advisor to the Company due to its experience, expertise and qualifications in
advising companies on M&A transactions. At this time, Centerview received and began reviewing
information regarding the Company and the proposed transaction, including the Management Projections.
On January 26, 2023 and January 29, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and
Wachtell Lipton and certain members of Company management met via videoconference to discuss
information reviewed and financial analysis conducted to date.
On January 31, 2023, Evercore, the Special Committee, and the Company executed a letter agreement
with Evercore finalizing the terms of Evercore’s engagement.
On February 1, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain
members of Company management met via videoconference, during which meeting the representatives
21 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Evercore presented Evercore’s preliminary financial analysis. Following discussion with the
representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton, the Special Committee determined to make a
counterproposal to Platinum’s and Solenis’ initial proposal at a price to be finalized, but at least $10.00 per
Ordinary Share held by the Unaffiliated Shareholders, with such counterproposal assuming that the
definitive agreements providing for the Transactions would include (i) a non-waivable condition that a
majority of the outstanding Ordinary Shares owned by holders other than the Bain Shareholder vote their
Ordinary Shares in favor of the Transactions (a “Majority of the Minority Approval Condition”) and (ii) the
ability of holders of the Ordinary Shares other than the Bain Shareholder to, at such holders’ election, (a)
receive cash consideration or (b) contribute Ordinary Shares to the surviving entity on the same terms as the
Bain Shareholder (a “Public Rollover Option”).
On February 2, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain
members of Company management met via videoconference to discuss the proposed counterproposal and
finalize the price to be included therein. After discussion, the Special Committee instructed representatives
of Evercore to communicate a counterproposal (including both the Majority of the Minority Approval
Condition and the Public Rollover Option) at a price of at least $10.20 per Ordinary Share, as well as its
rationale for the counterproposal, to Platinum and instructed representatives of Wachtell Lipton to
communicate the same information to the Bain Shareholder. The Special Committee instructed its advisors to
indicate, in conveying the counterproposal, that the Special Committee was only concerned with the price
applicable to the Unaffiliated Shareholders.
Later on February 2, 2023, representatives of Evercore met via telephone with representatives of
Platinum and presented the Special Committee’s initial counterproposal of at least $10.20 per Ordinary Share
held by the minority shareholders (as compared to $7.50 per Ordinary Share held by all shareholders
proposed by Platinum and Solenis in the January 11 Letter), as well as the Special Committee’s request for
the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition and the Public Rollover Option. At the direction of the
Special Committee, representatives of Evercore stated during the call that the Special Committee had
considered the following factors, among others, in formulating its counterproposal: (i) higher transaction
multiples in the hygiene/cleaning sectors than represented by Platinum’s and Solenis’ offer of $7.50 per
Ordinary Share; (ii) the potential easing of both challenging market headwinds and raw material cost
increases currently affecting the Company’s financial performance; and (iii) trading multiples for peer
companies were at relatively low levels compared with historical averages.
Additionally, on February 2, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton communicated the Special
Committee’s counterproposal to the Bain Shareholder. In this and subsequent discussions, representatives
of the Bain Shareholder indicated (i) the Bain Shareholder’s view that $10.20 per Ordinary Share
counterproposal was significantly higher than any price Platinum would be willing to pay to all of the
holders of Ordinary Shares and (ii) that the Bain Shareholder did not believe it was appropriate to agree to a
transaction that included either (a) differential cash consideration between the Bain Shareholder and the
other shareholders or (b) a Majority of the Minority Approval Condition. The Bain Shareholder also
indicated that it did not believe Platinum would agree to a Majority of the Minority Approval Condition.
On February 6 and February 7, 2023, Company management hosted a management due diligence session
in person at the offices of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (“Gibson Dunn”), Platinum’s and Solenis’ counsel,
in New York and via videoconference for Platinum that was also attended by representatives of Solenis, the
Bain Shareholder, the Company, Wachtell Lipton, J.P. Morgan, Centerview and Evercore. In response to
questions posed by representatives of Platinum and Solenis, Company management provided information
regarding Company strategy, prospects, operations, financial performance, liquidity, capital resources and
similar matters, including the Management Projections.
On February 7, 2023, Platinum delivered a counterproposal to representatives of Evercore of $7.75 per
Ordinary Share, an increase of $0.25 per Ordinary Share from its previous proposal of $7.50, noting that such
counterproposal did not include the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition or the Public Rollover
Option and that neither the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition nor the Public Rollover Option were
acceptable to them. Platinum further noted that the $7.75 per Ordinary Share price applied to both the
Ordinary Shares held by the Bain Shareholder and the Ordinary Shares held by any other shareholders, and
that the negotiation of any deviation from this construct (i.e., differential cash consideration between
22 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Bain Shareholder and any other shareholders) should be between representatives of the Bain
Shareholder and the Special Committee, not involving Platinum.
On February 9, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain
members of Company management met via videoconference to discuss Platinum’s counterproposal of $7.75
per Ordinary Share and the terms thereof. The Special Committee discussed with representatives of Evercore
and Wachtell Lipton and determined, following further discussions, to reject Platinum’s proposal of $7.75 per
Ordinary Share and hold firm on the Special Committee’s prior counterproposal of at least $10.20 per
Ordinary Share in cash for the minority shareholders, including the Public Rollover Option and Majority of
the Minority Approval Condition. The Special Committee instructed representatives of Evercore and
Wachtell Lipton to communicate the position of the Special Committee to Platinum and to the Bain
Shareholder and subsequently report back to the Committee. On February 10, 2023, representatives of
Evercore relayed the terms of the Special Committee’s counterproposal to representatives of Platinum and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton relayed the terms of the Special Committee’s counterproposal to
representatives of Bain.
On February 12, 2023, the Special Committee and representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton met
with representatives of the Bain Shareholder via videoconference. The Bain Shareholder’s representatives
discussed with the Special Committee the actions taken and numerous concessions agreed to by the Bain
Shareholder in order to facilitate the Transactions, based on requests by Platinum given market conditions,
including (1) the acceptance by the Bain Shareholder of a rollover into common and preferred equity
securities in lieu of cash for a portion of its Ordinary Shares in order to both increase the amount of cash
consideration available to the minority shareholders, and ensure that minority shareholders would be able to
receive cash for all of their Ordinary Shares, and that the Bain Shareholder’s Ordinary Shares would be
valued below what the Bain Shareholder considered to be fair market value for the benefit of Platinum; (2) the
acceptance by the Bain Shareholder of certain terms proposed by Platinum related to such rollover and its
continued ownership of equity interests in the combined company after the consummation of the
Transactions, including limited minority rights; (3) an agreement to waive contractual rights under the
Company’s Tax Receivable Agreement (such rights estimated by the Bain Shareholder as having a value of
approximately $76.7 million as of December 31, 2022) that the Bain Shareholder would otherwise have been
entitled to in connection with the Transactions and (4) an agreement by the Bain Shareholder to enter into a
tax indemnity agreement, pursuant to which the Bain Shareholder could be required to indemnify Platinum
and its related parties against certain potential tax-related liabilities and losses in an amount of up to
€200,000,000. The Bain Shareholder’s representatives reiterated to the Special Committee that the Bain
Shareholder did not consider it appropriate to accept differential cash consideration between the Bain
Shareholder and the other shareholders, in part because of the Bain Shareholder’s view that such differential
consideration was not common market practice and in light of the other concessions it believed it was
already making to facilitate the Transactions.
After discussion following the departure of the Bain Shareholder’s representatives from the meeting,
the Special Committee determined to continue negotiating for a transaction with one or more of the following
three characteristics for the benefit of the Unaffiliated Shareholders: (i) a Public Rollover Option; (ii) cash
consideration for the Unaffiliated Shareholders significantly higher than Platinum’s current proposal (which,
based on Platinum’s feedback to date, likely would require the Bain Shareholder to accept cash consideration
at a lower price per Ordinary Share than the Unaffiliated Shareholders); and/or (iii) a Majority of the Minority
Approval Condition. The Special Committee then instructed representatives of Evercore to prepare a list of
precedent transactions wherein minority public shareholders were offered differential cash consideration
from the majority shareholder for the Special Committee’s review, which representatives of Evercore provided
the following day.
On February 13, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and
certain members of Company management met at Wachtell Lipton’s offices (with some participants joining
via videoconference) to discuss the actions taken and concessions made by the Bain Shareholder to
facilitate the Transactions and discuss expectations around an expected counterproposal from Platinum.
On February 14, 2023, Platinum delivered a counterproposal to representatives of Evercore of $7.90 per
Ordinary Share, noting that such counterproposal did not include the Majority of the Minority Approval
Condition or the Public Rollover Option.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 14, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and
certain members of Company management met at Wachtell Lipton’s offices (with some participants joining
via videoconference) to discuss the updated counterproposal from Platinum of $7.90 per Ordinary Share and
the terms thereof. Following discussion, the Special Committee agreed to meet again the following day to
further consider this counterproposal and various potential responses thereto before determining next steps.
Also on February 14, 2023, representatives of Gibson Dunn delivered an initial draft of the Merger
Agreement and the Voting Agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton and K&E. The draft Merger
Agreement contemplated, among other things, a Company termination fee of 4.5% of the equity value implied
by the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction and a Parent termination fee of 4.0% of the
equity value implied by the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction and no Majority of the
Minority Approval Condition.
On February 15, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and
certain members of Company management held a follow-up meeting at Wachtell Lipton’s offices (with some
participants joining via videoconference) to further discuss the proposed counteroffer to Platinum and the
Bain Shareholder. After discussion, the Special Committee instructed representatives of Evercore and
Wachtell Lipton to communicate the counterproposal to Platinum and the Bain Shareholder of, at the Bain
Shareholder and Platinum’s election, (i) $8.00 per Ordinary Share for the minority shareholders with the
Majority of the Minority Approval Condition or (ii) $9.00 per Ordinary Share for the minority shareholders
without the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition. The Special Committee determined not to include
the Public Rollover Option in the terms of its counterproposal considering, among other factors, Platinum’s
position that the Public Rollover Option would create significant execution complexity and that Platinum
would in any event be unwilling to permit Solenis to become a publicly traded company in the current market
environment. Also at this meeting, representatives of Evercore reviewed with the Special Committee potential
deal structures where the minority shareholders would receive differential consideration from the Bain
Shareholder, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed their preliminary perspectives on the draft
Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement received from Gibson Dunn.
On February 15, 2023, pursuant to the Special Committee’s instructions, representatives of Evercore
delivered the counterproposal discussed at the February 15, 2023 Special Committee meeting to
representatives of each of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder.
On February 18, 2023, Wachtell Lipton delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson
Dunn. The draft Merger Agreement contemplated, among other things, a Company termination fee of 2.5% of
the equity value implied by the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction and a Parent
termination fee of 8.0% of the equity value implied by the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the
transaction and a condition to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger that the Special Committee
shall not have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change (the “Special Committee Recommendation
Condition”).
On February 23, 2023, Gibson Dunn delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Wachtell
Lipton and, on February 24, 2023, delivered the same revised draft of the Merger Agreement to K&E. The
draft Merger Agreement contemplated, among other things, a Company termination fee of 4% of the equity
value implied by the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction and a Parent termination fee of
4.5% of the equity value implied by the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction, removal of
the Special Committee Recommendation Condition, that the parties would not be obligated to consummate
the Merger prior to October 31, 2023 to afford Platinum time to obtain its debt financing and, in the event the
Company has been granted the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger, Parent’s ability to (in lieu of the
Company’s right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger) terminate the
Merger Agreement and promptly pay the Parent termination fee (the “Specific Performance Termination
Right”).
On February 28, 2023, Platinum delivered a counterproposal to representatives of Evercore of $7.95 per
Ordinary Share, an increase of $0.05 per Ordinary Share from its previous proposal of $7.90, noting
24 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that such counterproposal contemplated no Majority of the Minority Approval Condition, no Public Rollover
Option and no differential cash consideration between the Bain Shareholder and the other shareholders.
Also on February 28, 2023, Wachtell Lipton delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson
Dunn, which reflected input and revisions from K&E. The draft Merger Agreement contemplated, among
other things, a Company termination fee of 3% of the equity value implied by the per share price for the
Ordinary Shares in the transaction and a Parent termination fee of 7% of the equity value implied by the per
share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction, reinstatement of the Special Committee
Recommendation Condition, that the parties would not be obligated to consummate the Merger prior to the
date that is 4.5 months after execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement to afford Platinum time to
obtain its debt financing and removal of the Specific Performance Termination Right.
On March 1, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain
members of Company management met via videoconference to discuss the updated counterproposal from
Platinum of $7.95 per Ordinary Share and the terms thereof and the status of the draft transaction
agreements. After discussion, the Special Committee determined to have a follow-up meeting the next day to
further discuss next steps.
On March 2, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton met with representatives of Gibson Dunn via
telephone to discuss certain terms in the Merger Agreement. Significant terms discussed and negotiated at
such meeting included, among other matters, the duration and terms of the Company’s “fiduciary out”
period, the efforts that would be required of the parties to obtain certain regulatory approvals, the length of
time Platinum would be afforded to obtain its debt financing under certain circumstances set forth in the
Merger Agreement, the quantum of the termination fee payable by the Company to Parent and the reverse
termination fee payable by Parent to the Company (in the circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement),
the nature of each party’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and the Majority of the Minority
Approval Condition. Representatives of each firm and K&E continued to engage in various discussions
regarding the Merger Agreement and the other transaction agreements, and to exchange drafts thereof, on an
iterative basis through the execution of the transaction documents on March 8, 2023, with the foregoing
terms being the principal terms negotiated during such time.
Also on March 2, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and
certain members of Company management met via videoconference to continue discussing the latest
counterproposal from Platinum. The representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Evercore updated the Special
Committee on recent discussions with representatives of Platinum and Solenis and the Bain Shareholder.
After discussion, the Special Committee determined that if the cash consideration offered by Platinum
increased sufficiently, or if the Bain Shareholder accepted differential cash consideration from the other
shareholders, the Transactions would not need to include the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition.
The Special Committee instructed representatives of Evercore to reject Platinum’s latest proposal and
counter with a proposal of $8.90 for the minority shareholders per Ordinary Share, without the Majority of
the Minority Approval Condition. The Special Committee also instructed representatives of Evercore to
encourage Platinum to engage with the Bain Shareholder to find ways those two parties could modify the
transaction structure, including potentially differential cash consideration between Ordinary Shares held by
the Bain Shareholder versus the other shareholders, to accommodate the delivery of a higher price to such
other shareholders. Representatives of Evercore delivered this message to Platinum later that day.
On March 3, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain
members of Company management met via videoconference, wherein representatives of Evercore confirmed
to the Special Committee that they had communicated the Special Committee’s counterproposal to Platinum.
The Special Committee determined to wait for a response from Platinum to the Special Committee’s
counterproposal prior to taking any further action.
Later on March 3, 2023, representatives of Platinum delivered a revised counterproposal to
representatives of Evercore of $8.00 per Ordinary Share to shareholders of the Company on a combined
basis, consisting of differential consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share to the minority shareholders, and
lower consideration of $7.84 per Ordinary Share to the Bain Shareholder, and also communicated the
counterproposal to representatives of the Bain Shareholder. Also on March 3, 2023, the Chairman of the
25 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Special Committee spoke via telephone with a representative of the Bain Shareholder, who indicated that in
order to facilitate the deal and in addition to the other concessions previously accepted, the Bain
Shareholder was prepared to accept the proposed differential consideration of $7.84 per Ordinary Share, such
that the minority shareholders would receive $8.40 per Ordinary Share. The Chairman of the Special
Committee subsequently updated the other members of the Special Committee, as well as representatives of
Evercore and Wachtell Lipton, on this revised proposal.
On March 4, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain
members of Company management met via videoconference to discuss the updated counterproposal from
Platinum and concession by the Bain Shareholder to accept a lower price per share than the other
shareholders. After discussion, the Special Committee unanimously determined to provisionally accept
Platinum’s counteroffer for $8.40 per Ordinary Share for the minority shareholders, subject to finalization of
transaction documents, the receipt of Evercore’s fairness opinion and final approval. The Committee
instructed representatives of Evercore to finalize its financial analysis of the $8.40 per Ordinary Share for the
minority shareholders proposal and instructed Wachtell Lipton to continue to negotiate and finalize the
Merger Agreement and other transaction documents with Gibson Dunn and K&E. Later on March 4, 2023,
Wachtell Lipton, Gibson Dunn and K&E participated in a call to discuss and continue negotiating terms of
the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents.
Also on March 4, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Centerview, finalizing the
terms of Centerview’s engagement as a financial advisor to the Company.
On March 6, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement with J.P. Morgan, finalizing the terms of
J.P. Morgan’s engagement as an additional financial advisor to the Company.
On March 7, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting via videoconference, attended by
representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain members of Company management, to discuss
and review the draft Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the TRA Termination Agreement and the
Guarantee and to consider the Transactions. Representatives of Evercore reviewed with the Special
Committee Evercore’s financial analysis of the consideration proposed in the Transactions to be paid to the
Unaffiliated Shareholders. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed the terms of the draft transaction
agreements. Representatives of Evercore then rendered Evercore’s oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed in writing, to the Special Committee to the effect that, as of the date of and subject to the
assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions set forth in such opinion, the Merger
Consideration, is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ordinary Shares (other than holders of
Bain Shares or Excluded Shares). See “Special Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial
Advisor.” The representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed certain legal matters with the Special Committee,
including the fiduciary duties of directors under the circumstances of the Transactions. Following additional
discussion, including of the factors summarized in “Special Factors-Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board; Fairness of the Merger,” the
members of the Special Committee unanimously: (i) determined that the Proposed Transaction, including the
Merger Agreement, the TRA Termination Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Guarantee and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, was fair to and in the best interests of the
Unaffiliated Shareholders, (ii) recommended that the Board approve, adopt and declare advisable the Merger
Agreement and cause the Company to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, (iii) recommended that the Board approve the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, the TRA Termination
Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Guarantee, and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated thereby, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, (iv) recommended that
the Board direct that the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger be submitted to the Company
Shareholders for approval and (v) recommended that the Board resolve to recommend that the Company
Shareholders authorize the Plan of Merger in accordance with the Company’s organizational documents and
the CICA.
Later on March 7, 2023, following the Special Committee’s meeting, the Board held a meeting by
videoconference, attended by representatives of K&E and Wachtell Lipton and certain members of Company
management, to discuss and review the draft Merger Agreement, to receive the report of the Special
Committee and to consider the Transactions. Following this discussion, representatives of Wachtell Lipton
described the process undertaken by the Special Committee and its financial advisor, the receipt of
26 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Evercore’s opinion and the Special Committee’s recommendation that the Merger Agreement be approved.
Following such discussion the Board unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the
Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; (iii)
directed that the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger be submitted to the Company Shareholders for
approval; and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Company Shareholders authorize the Plan of Merger in
accordance with the Company’s organizational documents and the CICA.
Following such meeting and early in the morning of March 8, 2023, the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub executed the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents, and prior to the opening of trading
of the Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the

The Board formed the Special Committee consisting solely of directors of the Company who are not
directly or indirectly affiliated with, and who are otherwise independent from, the Bain Shareholder and
Platinum and who are not members of the Company’s management to, among other things, review, evaluate
and negotiate the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. The
Special Committee evaluated the Merger, in consultation with the Company’s management and its own
independent legal and financial advisors and considered various material factors. After careful consideration,
the Special Committee unanimously (i) determined that the Transactions, including the Merger Agreement,
the TRA Termination Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Limited Guarantee and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Unaffiliated
Shareholders, (ii) recommended that the Board approve, adopt and declare advisable the Merger Agreement
and cause the Company to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, (iii) recommended that the Board approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, the TRA Termination Agreement, the
Voting Agreement and the Limited Guarantee, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated thereby, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, (iv) recommended that the Board
direct that the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for
approval and (v) recommended that the Board resolve to recommend that the Company’s shareholders
authorize the Plan of Merger in accordance with the Company’s organizational documents and the CICA.
At a meeting of the Board on March 7, 2023, the Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation
of the Special Committee, unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company, and
declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement
by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and
the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, (iii) directed that the
Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval and (iv)
resolved to recommend that the Company’s shareholders authorize the Plan of Merger in accordance with the
Company’s organizational documents and the CICA.
Accordingly, the Board recommends that the Company’s shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal (Proposal 1).

advisors and considered the following factors as being generally supportive of their determinations and
recommendations, which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of
importance:
the Merger Consideration for the minority shareholders of $8.40 per Ordinary Share represented a
premium of 41% over the closing price of the Ordinary Shares on March 7, 2023, the last trading day
before the announcement of the Merger Agreement, and a 42% premium to the volume weighted
average price for the 30-day trading period ended March 7, 2023;
information available to the Special Committee with respect to the Company’s business, operations,
financial condition, earnings and prospects, the Company’s long-range plans, and the risks in
achieving those prospects and plans, including the information further described in the section
herein entitled “Management Projections” beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement;
recent market volatility related to the evolving macroeconomic headwinds facing the Company and
the hygiene, infection prevention or cleaning solutions industries more generally, including increased
risk of recession, persistent high inflation and the impact of changed economic circumstances on key
customer segments;
the Special Committee’s belief that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, were more favorable to the Company and the Unaffiliated Shareholders, when
compared with the Company’s stand-alone business plan and long-term prospects, and the
associated benefits and risks;
the fact that the Special Committee was able to negotiate an increase in the offer price from the $7.50
per Ordinary Share consideration offered in the January 11 Letter to $8.40 per Ordinary Share on
behalf of the Unaffiliated Shareholders, representing an increase of approximately 12%;
the fact that the minority shareholders are receiving a higher cash price per Ordinary Share than the
Bain Shareholder is receiving in respect of its Ordinary Shares receiving cash consideration;
the belief by the Special Committee, after discussions with the Special Committee’s advisors and
negotiations with Platinum and the Bain Shareholder, that the consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary
Share for the minority shareholders was likely the highest price per Ordinary Share that Platinum was
willing to pay and $0.56 was the greatest consideration differential between the Merger Consideration
and the Bain Consideration that the Bain Shareholder was willing to accept, that the terms were the
most favorable terms the Parent and the Bain Shareholder would be willing to agree to and that
further negotiations would create a risk of causing the Parent or the Bain Shareholder to abandon the
transaction altogether or materially delay the entry into a definitive agreement for the transaction;
the financial and other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (including the consideration of
$8.40 per Ordinary Share, in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding taxes) and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, resulting from extensive arm’s-length
negotiations conducted at the direction of the Special Committee, with the assistance of experienced
legal and financial advisors, during a process that occurred over the course of approximately two
months;
the current and historical market prices of the Ordinary Shares, considering the market performance of
the Ordinary Shares relative to the common stock of other participants in the industry in which the
Company operates and general market indices;
that the Merger Consideration consists solely of cash, providing the Unaffiliated Shareholders with
certainty of value and liquidity, while eliminating long-term business and execution risk;
the oral opinion of Evercore, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion,
dated March 7, 2023, to the Special Committee to the effect that, as of that date and based on and
subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in its opinion,
the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ordinary Shares
(other than the holders of Bain Shares and Excluded Shares) (as more fully described under “Special
Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor”), and which analyses and conclusions
are expressly adopted by the Special Committee (the Special Committee considered the

holders of Ordinary Shares (other than the holders of Bain Shares and Excluded Shares) to be situated
substantially similarly to the security holders unaffiliated with the Company generally);
the fact that Company shareholders who properly exercise their dissention rights in accordance with
Section 238 of the CICA will be entitled to such dissenting rights in connection with the Merger;
the likelihood of the Merger being completed, based on, among other matters:
the limited nature of the conditions to completion of the Merger as provided by the Merger
Agreement, including the absence of a financing condition;
the requirement that Parent and Merger Sub take certain actions, subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, to obtain the regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger,
subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;
the fact that the Bain Shareholder, who holds approximately 73.0% of the voting power of the
Company’s outstanding share capital, has duly executed and entered into the Voting Agreement,
pursuant to which it has agreed to vote the Bain Shares in favor of the Merger Proposal, subject
to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the Voting Agreement; and
the availability of the remedy of specific performance to the Company under the Merger
Agreement in certain circumstances, including the Company’s right under the Equity
Commitment Letter to cause the Equity Financing to be funded if, among other things, the
conditions to closing are satisfied (or would be satisfied at the Closing) and the Debt Financing
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing;
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
the fact that Parent must pay the Parent Termination Fee of $125,000,000 to the Company in
certain circumstances, including if the Parent fails to consummate the Merger pursuant to its
obligations under the Merger Agreement, or due to a material uncured breach by Parent under
the Merger Agreement;
the Company’s right, in response to an unsolicited written bona fide acquisition proposal and
subject to compliance with certain procedural requirements (including the Special Committee’s
good faith belief (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that
such proposal constitutes or will lead to a Superior Proposal), (i) to furnish information with
respect to the Company to a person making such acquisition proposal and (ii) to engage in
negotiations or discussions with the person making such acquisition proposal;
the ability of the Special Committee to change or withdraw its recommendation, subject to
compliance with certain procedural requirements, that the Unaffiliated Shareholders vote in favor
of the Merger Proposal in connection with (i) an unsolicited written bona fide acquisition
proposal that the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal or (ii) a specified Intervening
Event, if the Special Committee determines that the failure to change or withdraw its
recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
the ability of the Company, at the Special Committee’s direction, to terminate the Merger
Agreement within a 30 business day period following execution of the Merger Agreement in
connection with a Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with certain procedural requirements,
including payment of the Company Termination Fee, if the Special Committee determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; and

conduct its business in the ordinary course until the consummation of the Merger or the

the potential risks to the Company’s ability to pursue and execute long-term strategic objectives and
growth plans as a public company.
The Special Committee believes that sufficient procedural safeguards were, and are, present to ensure
the fairness of the Merger and to permit the Special Committee to represent effectively the interests of the
Unaffiliated Shareholders. These procedural safeguards include the following:
that, from its formation, the Special Committee was granted authority to, among other things, review,
evaluate and negotiate the terms and conditions, and to determine the advisability of, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, to recommend to the
Board what action, if any, should be taken by the Board with respect to the Transactions (including
recommending not to pursue the Transactions), and the fact that the Board agreed that it would not
approve, or recommend to the Unaffiliated Shareholders the Merger Proposal without the favorable
recommendation of the Special Committee;
that the members of the Special Committee are not employees of, or otherwise affiliated with the
Parent or the Bain Shareholder, and are not expected to have an economic interest in the Company or
the Surviving Company following the completion of the Merger;
that the Special Committee received the advice and assistance of experienced independent legal and
financial advisors;
the various terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the fact that the Merger
Agreement provides that it cannot be amended, nor may any provision be waived by the Company,
without the approval and at the direction of the Special Committee;
that, at the direction of the Special Committee, with the assistance of legal and financial advisors,
extensive negotiations occurred with Parent regarding the consideration to be paid pursuant to the
Merger Agreement that resulted in an increase in such consideration from Platinum’s and Solenis’
price proposal on January 11, 2023 of $7.50 per Ordinary Share to $8.40 per Ordinary Share price for
the minority shareholders;
that the members of the Special Committee met on numerous occasions during the course of
approximately two months (with its legal and financial advisors present) to discuss the potential
acquisition, the ongoing negotiations with Parent and financial information relating to the Company;
and
that the Special Committee and Board made their evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger
based upon the factors discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the interests
of the Bain Shareholder in the Merger.
The Special Committee also considered the following uncertainties, risks and potentially countervailing
factors in their deliberations concerning the Merger, which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not
presented in any relative order of importance:
that, following the completion of the Merger, the Company will no longer exist as an independent
public company and that the consummation of the Merger and receipt of the Merger Consideration in
the Merger, while providing relative certainty of value, will not allow the Unaffiliated Shareholders to
participate in potential further growth in the Company’s assets (including following the Company’s
combination with Solenis), future earnings growth, future appreciation in value of the Ordinary
Shares or any future dividends after the Merger;
the risk that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, may not
be consummated in a timely manner or at all, and the consequences thereof, including (i) the potential
loss of value to the Company’s shareholders, (ii) the potential negative impact on the operations and
prospects of the Company, including the risk of loss of key personnel, and (iii) the market’s
perception of the Company’s prospects could be adversely affected if such transactions were delayed
or were not consummated;
the fact that Platinum and Solenis had in August 2022 made and subsequently withdrawn a proposal
to acquire the Company at the higher price of $11.00 per Ordinary Share;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the fact that the Merger Consideration for the minority shareholders of $8.40 per Ordinary Share
represented a decrease of 44% from the $15.00 per share price at which Ordinary Shares were sold
during the Company’s initial public offering, noting however that market, economic and industry
conditions had each changed materially since that time and it did not appear reasonably likely that
the Ordinary Shares would regain such trading levels on a standalone basis in any reasonable
timeframe, if at all;
the restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the Company’s solicitation of acquisition
proposals from third parties;
the possibility that, at the Closing, Parent’s available sources of Debt Financing are less than the
amount required to consummate the Merger, in which event the Company would not be able to
specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to complete the Merger and instead would have the sole and
exclusive remedy of terminating the Merger Agreement and causing Parent to pay the Parent
Termination Fee;
the understanding that some of the Company’s directors and executive officers have other interests in
the Merger in addition to their interests as shareholders of the Company, including the manner in
which they would be affected by the Merger (as discussed under “Special Factors-Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”);
the possible effects of the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the potential for suits, actions or proceedings in respect of the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the risk of any loss or change
in the relationship of the Company and its subsidiaries with their respective employees, agents,
customers and other business relationships, and any possible effect on the Company’s ability to
attract and retain key employees, including that employees might choose not to remain employed with
the Company prior to the completion of the Merger;
the restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the
Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which could delay or prevent the Company
from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take
with respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger;
that the receipt of cash in exchange for Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
the fact that the Merger Agreement does not include (i) an affirmative vote of a majority of the
Unaffiliated Shareholders as a condition to the Merger or (ii) the opportunity for the Unaffiliated
Shareholders to participate in any ongoing equity investment in the Surviving Company, and despite
the Special Committee’s attempts to include such conditions in the Merger Agreement, there are no
such conditions to the consummation of the Merger;
that the Company’s directors, officers and employees have expended and will expend extensive
efforts attempting to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and such
persons have experienced and will experience significant distractions from their work during the
pendency of such transactions; and
that the Company has incurred and will incur substantial costs in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, even if such transactions are not consummated.
The Special Committee concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant
to the Merger Agreement and the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger.
In considering the fairness of the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee did not consider the
liquidation value or net book value of the Company. The liquidation value was not considered because the
Company is a viable going concern and the Special Committee did not believe that the orderly sale of the
Company’s assets for cash and the subsequent distribution of proceeds from such sale was a practical
alternative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Therefore, the Special Committee
believed that the liquidation value of the Company is irrelevant to a determination as to whether the Merger
31 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to the Unaffiliated
Shareholders. Further, the Special Committee did not consider net book value, which is an accounting
concept, as a factor because they did not believe that net book value is a material indicator of the value of
the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of historical costs. Other than Platinum’s and
Solenis’ August 2022 proposal to acquire the Company at a price of $11.00 per Ordinary Share, which was
subsequently withdrawn, the Special Committee is not aware of any firm offers made by any other person for
a merger or consolidation of the Company with another company, the sale or transfer of all or substantially
all of the Company’s assets or a purchase of the Company’s securities that would enable such person to
exercise control of the Company during the past two years. In addition, the Special Committee did not seek to
establish a pre-Merger going concern value for the Company as such. Rather, the Special Committee believed
that the financial analyses presented by Evercore, as more fully summarized under the caption “Special
Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor,” on which the Special Committee relied in
making its recommendation to the Board, represented potential valuations of the Company as it continues to
operate its business. The Special Committee considered each of the analyses performed by Evercore in the
context of the opinion provided by Evercore as well as various additional factors, as discussed above.
The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive but is intended to summarize the material information and
factors considered by the Special Committee in its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger. The Special Committee reached the unanimous decision to
recommend that the Board approve the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement, considering the factors
described above and other factors that the Special Committee believed were appropriate. In view of the
variety of factors and the quality and amount of information considered, the Special Committee did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determinations. In addition, each individual member of the Special Committee may have given
different weight to different factors. The Special Committee conducted an overall review of the factors
described above, including thorough discussions with the Special Committee’s legal and financial advisors,
and considered the factors overall to be favorable to, and to support, their determinations.
Recommendation of the Diversey Board
The Board, on behalf of the Company, believes, based on the factors described below, that the Merger
is fair to the “unaffiliated security holders,” as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act.
The Board did not assess whether the “rollover” provisions of the Rollover Agreement, including the
terms of the common and preferred units to be received by the Bain Shareholder pursuant to the Rollover
Agreement, or the differential merger consideration to be received by the Bain Shareholder is advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of the Bain Shareholder. Based on the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee (discussed further below) and on the basis of the other factors described above and below, the
Board unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company, and declared it advisable,
to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, (iii) directed that the Merger
Agreement and the Plan of Merger be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval and (iv)
resolved to recommend that the Company’s shareholders authorize the Plan of Merger in accordance with the
Company’s organizational documents and the CICA.
In the course of reaching its determination and making its recommendations, the Board considered the
following non-exhaustive list of material factors and countervailing factors, which are not presented in any
relative order of importance:
the Special Committee’s analysis (as to both substantive and procedural aspects of the Merger),
conclusions and unanimous determination, which the Board adopted, that the Merger Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Shareholders (and, as described
in this proxy statement, the “unaffiliated security holders,” as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 of
the Exchange Act). The Board also considered the Special Committee’s unanimous recommendation
32

TABLE OF CONTENTS
that the Board (i) approve, adopt and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and cause the
Company to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
(ii) approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its covenants and other
obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated thereby, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, (iii) direct that the Merger
Agreement and the Plan of Merger be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval and (iv)
resolve to recommend that the Company’s shareholders authorize the Plan of Merger in accordance
with the Company’s organizational documents and the CICA;
the procedural fairness of the Merger, including that (i) it was negotiated by the Special Committee
consisting solely of independent (for purposes of serving on the Special Committee) and
disinterested directors that are not affiliated with, and are independent of, the Bain Shareholder and
were otherwise disinterested and independent with respect to a potential acquisition of the Company,
other than as discussed in the section entitled “Special Factors-Interests of the Company’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger”; and (ii) the Special Committee had the authority to negotiate
the Merger Agreement, determine the advisability of the Transactions, to recommend to the Board
what action should be taken with respect to the Transactions and to select and engage, and was
advised by, its own independent legal and financial advisors; and
the other material factors and countervailing factors considered by the Special Committee and listed
above.
The Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the
Merger Agreement and the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger Agreement and
the Merger.
In considering the fairness of the Merger Agreement, the Board did not consider the liquidation value or
net book value of the Company. The liquidation value was not considered because the Company is a viable
going concern and the Board did not believe that the orderly sale of the Company’s assets for cash and the
subsequent distribution of proceeds from such sale was a practical alternative to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Therefore, the Board believed that the liquidation value of the
Company is irrelevant to a determination as to whether the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to the Unaffiliated Shareholders. Further, the Board did not
consider net book value, which is an accounting concept, as a factor because they did not believe that net
book value is a material indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of
historical costs. Other than Platinum’s and Solenis’ August 2022 proposal to acquire the Company at a price
of $11.00 per Ordinary Share, which was subsequently withdrawn, the Board is not aware of any firm offers
made by any other person for a merger or consolidation of the Company with another company, the sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or a purchase of the Company’s securities that
would enable such person to exercise control of the Company during the past two years.
The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive but is intended to summarize the material information and
factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger. The Board reached the unanimous decision to recommend the Company’s
entry into the Merger Agreement, considering the factors described above and other factors that it believed
were appropriate. In view of the variety of factors and the quality and amount of information considered, the
Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered in reaching its determinations. In addition, each individual member of the Board may have
given different weight to different factors. The Board conducted an overall review of the factors described
above, and considered the factors overall to be favorable to, and to support, their determinations.
It should be noted that certain aspects of this explanation of the reasoning of both the Special
Committee and the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and
should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Factors Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements.”

The Special Committee retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger.
As part of this engagement, the Special Committee requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Ordinary Shares (other
than holders of Bain Shares or Excluded Shares ), a group of security holders which the Special Committee
considered to be situated substantially similarly to the security holders unaffiliated with the Company
generally. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on March 7, 2023, Evercore rendered to the Special
Committee its opinion to the effect that, as of March 7, 2023 and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $8.40
per share to be received by the holders of Ordinary Shares in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders (other than holders of Bain Shares or Excluded Shares).
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated March 7, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex G to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by
reference. The Company encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was
addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special
Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of Ordinary Shares should
vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared
to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying
business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that
Evercore deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to
Evercore by management of the Company, as approved for its use by the Special Committee (the
“Management Projections”, as defined and more fully described in the section entitled “Special
Factors-Management Projections” beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement);
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of
the Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Management
Projections (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving the Management
Projections);
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Ordinary Shares;
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those
of certain other publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant;
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the
Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that
Evercore deemed relevant;
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated March 7, 2023, of the Merger Agreement;
and
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore
deemed appropriate.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or
otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification
of such information (and Evercore did not assume responsibility or liability for any independent verification
of such information), and further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they
were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading.
34 TABLE OF CONTENTS
With respect to the Management Projections, Evercore assumed with the Special Committee’s consent that
they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. Evercore
expressed no view as to the Management Projections or the assumptions on which they were based.
For purposes of Evercore’s analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its
analysis, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ from the draft Merger Agreement
reviewed by Evercore, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger
Agreement were true and correct, that each party would perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of
the Merger would be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore further assumed, in all
respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases
necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or
condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or reduce
the contemplated benefits to the holders of the Ordinary Shares (other than the Bain Shares or Excluded
Shares) of the Merger.
Evercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and did
not make or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the
Company, nor was Evercore furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the
solvency or fair value of the Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar matters. Evercore’s opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to it as of the
date of Evercore’s opinion and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could
be evaluated on the date of the opinion. It was understood that subsequent developments may affect
Evercore’s opinion and that Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than
the fairness to the holders of the Ordinary Shares (other than the holders of Bain Shares or Excluded Shares),
from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. Evercore did not express any view on, and
Evercore’s opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any consideration
received in connection therewith by, the holders of Bain Shares or any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company, nor the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger
Agreement nor any allocation among shareholders of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, including among all holders of Ordinary Shares, nor as to the fairness of the amount or
nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Evercore
was not asked to, nor did Evercore express any view on, and Evercore’s opinion did not address, any other
term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of
the Merger, any offer to purchase, redeem or exchange, or consent solicitation undertaken with respect to,
outstanding debt securities of the Company, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger
Agreement including the Rollover Agreement or the TRA Termination Agreement. Evercore’s opinion did not
address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be
available to the Company, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in
the Merger. In arriving at its opinion, Evercore was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from
any third party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the Ordinary Shares or any business
combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute
a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to
how any holder of Ordinary Shares should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore did not express any
opinion as to the prices at which the Ordinary Shares will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of
volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Merger or as to the impact of the
Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations
when they come due. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and assumed the accuracy
and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory,
accounting and tax matters.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Special
Committee on March 7, 2023 in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does
not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses
described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these
analyses by Evercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it
is based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or before March 6, 2023 (the last full trading
date prior to the rendering of Evercore’s opinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions.
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and
financial conditions, industry sector performance and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated
as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates contained
in Evercore’s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
review, are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition,
analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses and reviews are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables
are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore’s financial analyses.
Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of such analyses.
Summary of Evercore’s Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present
value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows, defined as net operating profit after tax, plus
depreciation and amortization, less changes in net working capital and capital expenditures, less other adhoc
operating costs, plus other operating cash flow items, less M&A acquisition cash outflows, less cash
outflows relating to the Tax Receivable Agreement, that the Company was forecasted to generate during the
Company’s fiscal years 2023 through 2027 based on the Management Projections. Evercore calculated
terminal values for the Company utilizing terminal multiple and perpetuity growth rate methodologies.
Terminal Multiple Methodology
Evercore calculated terminal values for the Company by applying terminal multiples of 10.0x to 12.0x,
which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience, to the Company’s
estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) in fiscal year 2027 based
on the Management Projections. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to
present value as of January 1, 2023 using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.0%, which were based on
an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, and the mid-year cash flow discounting
convention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, the estimated Company Net Debt as of January
1, 2023, and the number of fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company’s
management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.95 to $9.68,
compared to the Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share. For purposes of Evercore’s analysis,
“Company Net Debt” was calculated as (1) total debt of the Company, plus (2) tax-effected pension liability,
plus (3) asset retirement obligations, less (4) cash and cash equivalents.
Perpetuity Growth Rate Methodology
Evercore calculated terminal values for the Company by applying perpetuity growth rates of 3.25% to
3.75%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal

year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate based
on the Management Projections. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to
present value as of January 1, 2023 using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.0%, which were based on
an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, and the mid-year cash flow discounting
convention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, the estimated Company Net Debt as of January
1, 2023, and the number of fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company’s
management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $5.72 to $9.03,
compared to the Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.
Selected Public Company Trading Analysis
Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding
financial multiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies of similar size as the
Company in the chemicals and services industry (the “Selected Companies”):
Ashland Global Specialty Chemicals Inc.
Avient Corporation
Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.
ChampionX Corporation
H.B. Fuller Company
Ingevity Corporation
Innospec Inc.
ISS A/S
Quaker Chemical Corporation
Sensient Technologies Corporation
Stepan Corporation
For each of the Selected Companies, Evercore calculated total enterprise value (defined as equity market
capitalization plus total debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as
a multiple of estimated EBITDA for the 2023 fiscal year, which is referred to as “2023E EBITDA”, based on
closing share prices as of March 3, 2023. Estimated financial data of the selected companies were based on
publicly available research analysts’ estimates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on the multiples it derived for the Selected Companies and based on its professional judgment
and experience, Evercore applied a total enterprise value / EBITDA multiple reference range of 10.5x-​12.0x to
the Company’s 2023E EBITDA based on the Management Projections. Based on this range of implied
enterprise values, the Company’s estimated Company Net Debt as of January 1, 2023, and the number of fully
diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this analysis indicated a
range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.25 to $7.95, compared to the Merger Consideration of
$8.40 per Ordinary Share.
Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, Evercore selected
these companies because they are publicly traded chemical and service companies that Evercore, in its
professional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of its
financial analyses. In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with
regard to general business, economic and market conditions affecting the selected companies and other
matters, as well as differences in the selected companies’ financial, business and operating characteristics.
Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis
involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values
of the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies. Mathematical analysis,
such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the
selected companies.
Evercore also reviewed and compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding
financial multiples and ratios for Ecolab Inc. (“Ecolab”), which Evercore considered to be a comparable
company based on its professional judgment and experience. Estimated financial data of Ecolab was based
on publicly available research analysts’ estimates. Evercore calculated the average discount since the time of
the Company’s initial public offering of the Company’s total enterprise value as a multiple of its next twelve
month EBITDA (“NTM EBITDA”) to Ecolab’s total enterprise value as a multiple of its NTM EBITDA.
Evercore subtracted the average discount of 7.8x that it calculated from a range of Ecolab’s total enterprise
value / NTM EBITDA multiples of 18.4x-20.0x based on Ecolab’s NTM EBITDA as of March 3, 2023 and
Ecolab’s NTM EBITDA at the time of the Company’s initial public offering, respectively, to derive a range of
total enterprise value / NTM EBITDA multiples for the Company of 10.6x-12.2x and applied this range of
multiples to the Company’s 2023E EBITDA based on the Management Projections. Based on this range of
implied enterprise values, the Company’s estimated Company Net Debt as of January 1, 2023, and the number
of fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.37 to $8.18, compared to the Merger
Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Evercore reviewed financial information related to the following selected transactions involving target
companies in the hygiene and cleaning chemicals industry announced since 2011 and selected the ones for
which financial information was publicly available (the “Selected Transactions”).
For each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied total enterprise value (defined as the
target company’s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus
total debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of last
twelve-month EBITDA for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction,
which we refer to as “LTM EBITDA”. Estimated financial data of the Selected Transactions were based on
publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction.

Based on the multiples it derived from the Selected Transactions and based on its professional
judgment and experience, Evercore selected a reference range of total enterprise value to LTM EBITDA
multiples of 12.0x to 14.0x and applied this range of multiples to the Company’s LTM EBITDA as of December
31, 2022 based on the financial results for the Company provided by the Company’s management. Based on
this range of implied enterprise values, the estimated Company Net Debt as of January 1, 2023, and the
number of fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.56 to $8.59, compared to the
Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.
Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the Selected Transactions analysis is
directly comparable to the Company and none of the Selected Transactions is directly comparable to the
Merger, Evercore selected these transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore,
in its professional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of
its financial analyses. In evaluating the Selected Transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions
with regard to general business, economic and market conditions and other factors existing at the time of the
Selected Transactions, and other matters, as well as differences in financial, business and operating
characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses in the Selected Transactions.
Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis
involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values
of the target companies or businesses in the Selected Transactions and the multiples derived from the
Selected Transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a
meaningful method of using the data of the Selected Transactions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses
with respect to its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other
things, the following:
Last 52-Week Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of Ordinary Shares during the twelve month period ended
March 6, 2023, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from $3.95 to $10.68 per
Ordinary Share, respectively.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the Ordinary Shares prepared and
published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of March 3, 2023. These price targets
reflect analysts’ estimates of the future public market trading price of the Ordinary Shares at the time the
price target was published. As of March 3, 2023, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets
per Ordinary Share was $5.00 to $9.00, with a median price target of $6 per share. No new price targets were
published on March 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the
Special Committee. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not
necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the Ordinary Shares and these target prices and the
analysts’ earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including
factors affecting the financial performance of the Company and future general industry and market
conditions.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price
Evercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per Ordinary
Share, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a
company’s equity as a function of that company’s NTM EBITDA, and an assumed enterprise value to NTM
EBITDA multiple.
In calculating the implied present value of the future price per Ordinary Share, Evercore first calculated
the implied future enterprise value of the Company by multiplying the Company’s estimated NTM EBITDA
for the 2026 fiscal year, based on the Management Projections, by an illustrative enterprise value to NTM
EBITDA multiple range of 8.8x to 10.8x, which was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and
experience, to derive an implied future enterprise value reference range for the Company as of December 31,
2025. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, and the Company Net Debt as of December 31, 2025,
as based on the Management Projections, Evercore calculated a reference range of implied future equity
values for the Company. Evercore then discounted the implied future equity values to back to January 1,
2023 using a discount rate of 12.2%, which was based on an estimate of the Company’s cost of equity. This
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $5.93 to $8.09, compared to the
Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore
reviewed 26 transactions and announced bids for control of U.S. public targets in the chemicals and materials
industry announced over the last 15 years. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the
premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each
such transaction exceeded the closing market prices per share of the target companies one day prior to the
announcement of each transaction and the volume weighted average price per share of the target companies
over a period of thirty days (“1M VWAP”) prior to announcement of each transaction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a
premium range of 28% to 41% to the closing price per Ordinary Share of $6.14 as of March 6, 2023 and
premium range of 31% to 49% to the 1M VWAP per Ordinary Share of $5.89 as of March 6, 2023. This
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $7.86 to $8.66 and $7.71 to $8.77,
respectively, compared to the Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each of the analyses performed in these preliminary Evercore presentations was subject to further
updating and subject to the final analyses presented to the Special Committee on March 7, 2023 by Evercore.
Each of these analyses was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market, regulatory and other
conditions and circumstances as they existed and as could be evaluated by Evercore as of the dates on
which Evercore performed such analyses. Accordingly, the results of the financial analyses may have
differed due to changes in those conditions and other information, and not all of the written and oral
presentations contained all of the financial analyses included in the March 7, 2023 presentation.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses or data presented by Evercore to the Special Committee. In connection with the review of the
Merger by the Special Committee, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of
the summary described above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view
of the processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered
the results of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one
analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the results of all the
analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other
analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of
analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual value of
the Ordinary Shares. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the
figures shown.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Special Committee as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Ordinary Shares
(other than holders of Bain Shares or the Excluded Shares). These analyses do not purport to be appraisals
or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates
contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the
results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore
assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of
the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The
issuance of Evercore’s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee, the Board
or the Company’s management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration in the Merger for the holders of Ordinary Shares.
Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Special Committee, the Company has
agreed to pay Evercore a fee for its services in the amount of approximately $8.5 million, of which $500,000
was paid as a retainer fee upon execution of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Company, $2,000,000 was
paid upon delivery of Evercore’s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to
indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been
engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the Company or its subsidiaries and Evercore has
not received any compensation from the Company or its subsidiaries during such period. During the two
year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and/or
other services to Platinum and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies and received fees for the rendering of
these services in the amount of approximately $10 million. During the two year period prior to the date of its
opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and/or other services to the Bain

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Shareholder and/or its respective affiliates and portfolio companies and received fees for the rendering of
these services in the amount of approximately $20 million. Evercore may provide financial advisory or other
services to the Company and Parent, Platinum and the Bain Shareholder or any of their respective affiliates or
portfolio companies in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive
compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the
accounts of customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and
research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these
businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as
investment funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly,
hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the
accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial
instruments of or relating to the Company, Parent, Platinum, the Bain Shareholder, or potential parties to the
Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or portfolio companies or persons that are competitors,
customers or suppliers of the Company, Parent, Platinum, the Bain Shareholder or any of their respective
affiliates or portfolio companies.
The Special Committee engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore’s
qualifications, experience and reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and regularly provides fairness opinions to its clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buyouts and valuations for corporate and other purposes.",53,62

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, each of the Parent Entities are an affiliate
of the Company for purposes of the Merger and, therefore, required to express their reasons for the Merger
to the Company’s Unaffiliated Shareholders. The Parent Entities are making the statements included in this
section solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the
Exchange Act. For the Parent Entities, the primary purpose of the Merger is to allow Parent to own equity
interests in the Company and to bear the rewards and risks of such ownership after the Merger is completed
and to cease public trading of the Ordinary Shares. The Parent Entities believe that structuring the
Transactions in such manner is preferable to other transaction structures because it (i) will enable Parent to
acquire all of the Ordinary Shares at the same time, (ii) will allow the Company to cease to be a publicly
registered and reporting company, and (iii) represents an opportunity for the Company’s Unaffiliated
Shareholders (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) to receive the Merger Consideration of $8.40
per Ordinary Share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.",62,62

may be required to express their beliefs as to the fairness of the going private transaction and the Merger to
the Company’s Unaffiliated Shareholders. The Parent Entities are making the statements included in this
section solely for purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and
regulations under the Exchange Act. However, the view of the Parent Entities as to the fairness of the going
private transaction and the Merger should not be construed as a recommendation to any Company
shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The
Parent Entities have interests in the going private transaction and the Merger that are different from, and in
addition to, those of the other shareholders of the Company.
The Parent Entities believe that the going private transaction and the Merger are fair to the Company’s
Unaffiliated Shareholders on the basis of the factors described under “Special Factors-Reasons for the
Merger” as set forth on pages 27 - 43 and have expressly adopted the conclusions and analysis of the
Special Committee and Board described above.

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the Bain Shareholder is an affiliate of the
Company for purposes of the Merger, and, therefore, required to express its purposes and reasons for the
Merger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company. The Bain Shareholder is making the statements in
this section solely for the purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under
the Exchange Act. The views of the Bain Shareholder do not make any recommendations as to how
shareholders of the Company should vote their Ordinary Shares relating to the Merger.
When approached by Platinum about the Company pursuing a potential sale of the Company, the Bain
Shareholder considered favorable current market conditions, and concluded that facilitating a take-private
transaction that would provide certain value to all of the Company’s shareholders, as well as a premium of
approximately 41.0% over the Company’s closing share price on March 7, 2023, the last full trading day prior
to the announcement of the proposed Transactions, could be attractive to the Unaffiliated Shareholders. The
Bain Shareholder ultimately agreed, in order to facilitate the proposed Transactions, to accept a lower price
for its Ordinary Shares, forfeit its rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, enter into the Tax Indemnity
Agreement, sell only a portion of the Bain Shares and to rollover the remaining portion of the Bain Shares.
The Bain Shareholder believes that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders to effect a
liquidity transaction that affords the opportunity to receive the applicable merger consideration and related
certainty of value, particularly when compared to the Company's stand-alone business plan and long-term
prospects, and the associated benefits and risks.
If the Merger is completed, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the
Ordinary Shares will cease to be publicly traded. For the Bain Shareholder, the purpose of the Merger is to
effectuate the Transactions and the Rollover Agreement, which will allow the Bain Shareholder to realize the
value of a portion of its Ordinary Shares by receiving $7.84 per Ordinary Share in cash for a portion of its
investment in the Company. The Bain Shareholder will also own common and preferred units of Topco (or, in
investment in the Company. The Bain Shareholder will also own common and preferred units of Topco (or, in
certain circumstances, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco) in exchange
for the remaining portion of its investment in the Company. The Bain Shareholder believes that structuring
the transaction in such manner is preferable to other alternative transaction structures because (i) it will
enable Parent to acquire all of the outstanding Shares of the Company at the same time and (ii) it represents
an opportunity for the Company’s Unaffiliated Shareholders to immediately realize the value of its
investment in the Company at a price of $8.40 per Ordinary Share in cash, without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes, and for the Bain Shareholder to immediately realize the value of a significant
portion of their investment in the Company at a price of $7.84 per Ordinary Share in cash, without interest
and subject to applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement. The Bain Shareholder did not consider any other alternative transaction
structures or other alternative means to accomplish the purposes set forth above because no other
alternatives would enable them to achieve the same objectives.",63,63

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the Bain Shareholder is an affiliate of the
Company for purposes of the Merger and, therefore, required to express its beliefs as to the fairness of the
proposed going private transaction and the Merger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company. The
Merger is the Rule 13e-3 transaction for which a Schedule 13E-3 Transaction Statement has been filed with
the SEC. As described below, the Bain Shareholder believes that the going private transaction and the
Merger is fair to the Company’s Unaffiliated Shareholders on the basis of the factors described under
“Special Factors-Reasons of the Company for the Merger” and “Special Factors-Position of the Parent
Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger.” Directors of the Company employed by the Bain Shareholder did
not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee regarding the going private transaction and the
Merger, and did not receive advice from the legal or other advisors of the Special Committee as to the
fairness
44 TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the going private transaction and the Merger. As disclosed under “Special Factors-Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” the Bain Shareholder has interests in the going
private transaction and the Merger both different from those of the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the
Company by virtue of the Bain Shareholder’s right to receive cash consideration of $7.84 per Ordinary Share,
without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (whereas the Unaffiliated Shareholders have
the right to receive cash consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share, without interest and subject to any
applicable withholding taxes) and the requirement of the Bain Shareholder to rollover a portion of its
ownership stake in the Company (such rollover being valued with the same per Ordinary Share valuation of
the Ordinary Shares used to determine the Bain Consideration) in exchange for an ownership stake in Topco
(and, in certain circumstances, a subsidiary of Topco), which will indirectly own the Company following the
consummation of the going private transaction and the Merger, and similar to those of the Unaffiliated
Shareholders by virtue of the fact that the Bain Shareholder is eligible to receive cash consideration for a
portion of its Ordinary Shares upon completion of the going private transaction and the Merger, albeit at a
lower price per Ordinary Share than will be received by the Unaffiliated Shareholders.
The Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company were represented by the Special Committee, which
negotiated the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement on their behalf, with the assistance of the
Special Committee’s independent legal and financial advisors. The Merger Agreement is recommended by the
Special Committee and approved by the Board. Based on the knowledge and analysis of the Bain
Shareholder of available information regarding the Company, as well as discussions with the Company’s
management regarding the Company and its business and the factors considered by, and the analysis and
resulting conclusions of, the Special Committee and the Board, the Bain Shareholder believes that the going
private transaction and the Merger is fair to the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company based upon
substantially the same factors described under “Special Factors-Reasons of the Company for the Merger.”
The Bain Shareholder agrees with the analyses, determinations and conclusions described under “Special
Factors-Recommendation of the Diversey Board of Directors and Special Committee,” “Special Factors-​
Reasons for the Merger- Recommendation of the Special Committee,” “Special Factors-Reasons for the
Merger-Recommendation of the Diversey Board,” “Special Factors-Reasons of the Parent Entities for the
Merger” and “Special Factors-Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger,” and the Bain
Shareholder expressly adopts the analyses and opinions of the Special Committee and the Board in reaching
its determination as to the fairness of the Transactions.
None of the Company’s directors that are affiliates of the Bain Shareholder served on the Special
Committee nor did they participate in the Special Committee’s evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the going private transaction and the Merger. For these
reasons, the Bain Shareholder does not believe that its interests in the going private transaction and the
Merger influenced the decisions or recommendations of the Special Committee or the Board with respect to
the Merger Agreement, going private transaction or the Merger.
In its consideration of the fairness of the proposed going private transaction and the Merger, the Bain
Shareholder did not find it practicable to, and did not: (i) appraise the assets of the Company to determine
the liquidation value for the Company’s Unaffiliated Shareholders, (ii) consider the net book value as a basis
to evaluate per Ordinary Share consideration, (iii) consider that liquidation sales generally result in proceeds
substantially less than sales of a going concern, (iv) consider the impracticability of determining a
liquidation value given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup, or (v) consider the Company’s
viability as a going concern. The Bain Shareholder did not consider net book value, which is an accounting
concept, for purposes of determining the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the Company’s Unaffiliated
Shareholders because, in their view, it does not reflect, or have any meaningful impact on, either the market
trading prices of the Ordinary Shares or the Company’s value as a going concern. The Bain Shareholder is
not aware of any firm offer for a merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company’s assets, or a
purchase of a controlling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company from
anyone other than a filing person in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Bain
Shareholder in connection with the fairness of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated
thereby, including that the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material
factors considered by the Bain Shareholder. The Bain Shareholder did not find it practicable to, and did not,

Following completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into the Company,
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Ordinary Shares are
currently listed on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act. Following completion of the Merger, there
will be no further public market for the Ordinary Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time and in compliance with applicable law, the Ordinary Shares will be delisted from Nasdaq and
deregistered under the Exchange Act.
The Parent Entities currently anticipate that following completion of the Merger, the Company’s
operations will be conducted substantially as they are currently being conducted (except that the Company
will cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent). The Parent
Entities are currently conducting a review of the Company and its business and operations with a view
towards determining how to redirect the Company’s operations to improve the Company’s long-term
earnings potential as a private company (including by reducing the Company’s costs and expenses following
the Merger) and expect to complete such review following completion of the Merger. Further, following
completion of the Merger, the Parent Entities will continue to assess the Company’s assets, corporate and
capital structure, capitalization, operations, business, properties and personnel to determine what additional
changes, if any, would be desirable following the Merger to enhance the business and operations of the
Company. The Parent Entities expect to enhance the Company’s business and operations by taking
advantage of certain expected synergies resulting from the combination of the Company’s business with
Solenis, a portfolio company of Platinum. Solenis is focused on water treatment solutions, which are
complementary to the products offered by the Company. Through combining Solenis and Diversey, the
Parent Entities expect to create a more diversified business with increased scale, broader global reach and
superior customer service capabilities. The Parent Entities expect this will enable the combined company to
grow and benefit from cross-selling opportunities. In addition, the Parent Entities may seek to buy or
combine the Company with target companies that provide additional earnings and growth synergies;
however, no such contracts, arrangements, plans, proposals, commitments or understandings regarding any
such transactions relating to the Company and its subsidiaries currently exist.
From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, (a) the directors of the Surviving Company will be the
directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with
the provisions of the CICA and the memorandum and articles of association of the Surviving Company until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, and (b) the officers of the Surviving
Company will be the officers of the Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold
office in accordance with the provisions of the CICA and the memorandum and articles of association of the
Surviving Company until their respective successors are duly appointed.
At the Effective Time, the memorandum and articles of association of the Surviving Company shall be
amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in exhibit to the Merger Agreement, until thereafter
amended as provided by the CICA and such memorandum and articles of association.",65,65

If the Requisite Shareholder Approval is obtained, and all conditions to the Merger are satisfied or
waived, the Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company in accordance with the Plan of Merger, and the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the
Company will continue as the Surviving Company in the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Treatment of the Ordinary Shares
If the Merger is completed, each Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and the Bain Shares) will automatically be cancelled and
exchanged into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, each Owned Company
Share will automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid
therefor and each Bain Share will automatically be cancelled and exchanged into the right to receive the Bain
Consideration. The Rollover Shares will be exchanged by the Bain Shareholder immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger for common and preferred units of Topco (or, in certain circumstances, common
units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco) in accordance with the terms of the Rollover
Agreement (such Rollover Shares being valued at an amount equal to $7.84 per Ordinary Share).
Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards
Diversey equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the
following treatment:
Each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be
cancelled without payment (whether in cash or other consideration).
Each Restricted Ordinary Share will automatically vest and be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to the Merger Consideration.
Each Unvested Non-IPO RSU and Unvested IPO RSU, in each case that is held by a non-employee
director of the Company, and each Vested Company PSU, Vested Company RSU and 2022 Bonus RSU
will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, based on
the Merger Consideration.
Each Transaction Bonus RSU and each Unvested IPO RSU that is held by an individual other than a
non-employee director of the Company will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, based on the Merger Consideration, payable on December 31, 2023,
subject to continued employment through the payment date, with accelerated vesting protection
upon a Qualifying Termination.
Each Unvested Company PSU, Unvested Closing RSU, Retention RSU and TRA RSU will
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, based on the
Merger Consideration, payable on December 31, 2024, subject to continued employment through the
payment date, with accelerated vesting protection upon a Qualifying Termination for each Unvested
Company PSU, Unvested Closing RSU and TRA RSU.
Each Unvested IPO Celebration RSU will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, based upon the Merger Consideration, payable on March 25, 2024, subject
to continued employment through the payment date.
Each Unvested Non-IPO RSU that is held by an individual other than a non-employee director of the
Company will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash, based on the
Merger Consideration, with 50% payable on December 31, 2023, and 50% payable on December 31,
2024, subject to continued employment through the payment date, with full accelerated vesting upon
a Qualifying Termination.
All payments made in connection with the treatment of Diversey equity awards are subject to
withholding taxes as required by law.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company’s equity awards (other than the Company Options, Unvested
IPO Celebration RSUs and the Retention RSUs) may be eligible to vest upon a holder’s termination by the
Company without Cause or by the holder for Good Reason. At the Effective Time, the Company will take all
action necessary to effect the cancellation and exchange (as applicable) of the Company equity awards
described above and the Company’s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan and each other employee plan that
provides for the award of Ordinary Shares or rights of any kind to receive Ordinary Shares or benefits
measured in whole or in part by reference to Ordinary Shares. Holders of Diversey equity awards at the
47 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to Company equity awards other than the rights to
receive the payments described above.
Benefits of the Merger for the Unaffiliated Shareholders
The primary benefit of the Merger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders will be their right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each Ordinary Share held by such shareholder as described above. This amount
constitutes a premium of 41.2% over the $5.95 closing price per Ordinary Share on Nasdaq on March 7, 2023,
the trading day prior to the date of the execution of the Merger Agreement, as well as a premium of $0.56 per
Ordinary Share, or 7.1%, over the amount being received by the Bain Shareholder for its Ordinary Shares.
Additionally, such shareholders will avoid the risk after the Merger of any possible decrease in Diversey’s
future earnings, growth or value.
Detriments of the Merger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders
The primary detriment of the Merger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders is the lack of an interest of such
shareholders in the potential future earnings, growth, or value realized by Diversey after the Merger. In
addition, the Unaffiliated Shareholders will not benefit from any sale of Diversey or its assets to a third party
in the future. Additionally, the receipt of cash in exchange for Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Merger will
generally be a taxable sale transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes to shareholders who surrender
their Ordinary Shares in the Merger to the extent that such shareholders have any gain on their Ordinary
Shares.",65,67
"Diversey Holdings, Ltd._20230515_DEFM14A_20878784_4665936.Pdf",Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed,"Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the Company’s shareholders or if the Merger is not
completed for any other reason, the Company’s shareholders will not receive any payment for their Ordinary
Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third party, the Company will
remain an independent public company, and the Ordinary Shares will continue to be listed and traded on
Nasdaq, so long as the Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In addition, if the
Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management will operate the Company’s business in a
manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that the Company’s shareholders will continue
to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject. There is no assurance
as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your Ordinary Shares, including the
risk that the market price of the Ordinary Shares may decline to the extent that the current market price of the
Ordinary Shares reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company would be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee, or Parent would be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee. See “The Merger
Agreement-Termination Fees and Expenses.”",67,67

The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term consolidated forecasts as to
future performance, earnings or other results given, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability
and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the Company is including a
summary of certain previously nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2023 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027 (collectively, the “Management
Projections”) that select members of the Company’s management provided to the Special Committee and the
Special Committee’s advisors in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. The Management
Projections were prepared on a stand-alone basis and do not take into account any of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any costs incurred in connection with the Merger, or any
changes to the Company’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the completion of the
Merger. As a result, actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the
Management Projections. You should note that Management Projections constitute forward-looking
statements.
The Company’s management provided the Management Projections to the Special Committee, and the
Special Committee directed Evercore to use the Management Projections in connection with performing
48 TABLE OF CONTENTS
certain of its financial analyses in connection with its opinion, as described in more detail in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “Special Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor.” The
Management Projections were also made available to representatives of Platinum the Bain Shareholder, J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC and Centerview Partners LLC. The summaries of these projections are being included
in this proxy statement solely to give Company shareholders access to non-public information that was
provided to Evercore in the course of evaluating the Merger and are not included in this proxy statement to
influence any Company shareholder to vote for the Merger Proposal, to vote against the Merger Proposal, or
for any other purpose. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of
the Company, its advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or
now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future performance or events, or that it should be
construed as financial guidance, and such summary projections set forth below should not be relied on as
such.
While presented with numeric specificity, the Management Projections reflect numerous estimates and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company, including, among
others, the Company’s assumptions about supply chain constraints, commodity prices, production and sales
volume levels, operating results, competitive conditions, technology, availability of capital resources, levels
of capital expenditures, other contractual obligations, inflation and the supply of and demand for its
products, as well as the other matters described in the section entitled “Cautionary Factors Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements.” The Management Projections reflect both assumptions as to certain business
decisions that are subject to change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and thus are susceptible to
multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The
Company can give no assurance that the Management Projections and the underlying estimates and
assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the Management Projections cover multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes more speculative with each successive year. This information constitutes
“forward-looking statements” and actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected.
See “Cautionary Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they
prepared with a view toward compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),
published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.
These non GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures
and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges
and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial
measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board
of directors in connection with a business combination transaction, such as the Management Projections,
are excluded from the definition of “non GAAP financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and
regulations. As a result, the Management Projections are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of
non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect
to the Management Projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on
such information or its achievability. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm to the
Company contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to
historical financial information of the Company, and such report does not extend to the projections included
below and should not be read to do so.
Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events
occurring after the date they were prepared. The Company can give no assurance that, had the Management
Projections been prepared as of the date of this proxy statement, similar estimates and assumptions would be
used. Except as required by applicable securities laws, the Company does not intend to, and disclaims any
obligation to, make publicly available any update or other revision to the Management Projections to reflect
circumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events,

even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error or to reflect changes
in general economic or industry conditions. The Management Projections do not take into account all the
possible financial and other effects on the Company of the Merger, the effect on the Company of any
business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement
having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have
been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated,
postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger. Further, the Management Projections do not take into
account the effect on the Company of any possible failure of consummation of the Merger and should not be
viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors,
advisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation
to any Company shareholder or other person regarding the Company’s ultimate performance compared to the
information contained in the Management Projections or to the effect that the forecasted results will be
achieved. The inclusion of the Management Projections herein should not be deemed an admission or
representation by the Company or its advisors or any other person that it is viewed as material information
of the Company, particularly in light of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts.
In light of the foregoing, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, Company
shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such information, and the Company urges all of its
shareholders to review the Company’s most recent SEC filings for a description of the Company’s reported
financial results.

forecast;
completion of Company initiatives and investments to optimize the Company’s supply chain in North
America;
impact on the Company by macroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressure and a potential
recession in Europe in 2023; and
ability by the Company to invest in attractive capital expenditure and acquisition opportunities.

Unlevered free cash flow means EBITDA less cash taxes, less changes in net working capital, less
capital expenditure, less other adhoc operating costs, less forecast M&A expenses, less forecast tax
receivable agreement payments plus other operating cash flow items. This measure should not be
considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations, net income (loss) or other measures derived
in accordance with GAAP.

In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Plan of
Merger and the Transactions, you should be aware that the Company’s executive officers and directors have
economic interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s
shareholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The Board was aware of
and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement
and the Merger and in reaching its decision to determine that the Transactions are in the best interests of the
Company and the Unaffiliated Shareholders, approve the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger

Special Committee Fees
Each of (a) Selim Bassoul, Juan R. Figuereo, Eric Foss, Rod Hochman and Katherine S. Zanotti, the
members of the Special Committee, is a director who is not directly or indirectly affiliated with, and who is
otherwise independent from, the Bain Shareholder and Platinum, and also is not a member of the Company’s

Committee, received an additional fee of $25,000, in each case, in connection with his services to the
Company with respect to the Merger (which fee is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger). The
aggregate fees paid to the members of the Special Committee totaled $525,000.
Treatment of Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity Awards
Diversey equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the
following treatment:
Each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be
cancelled without payment (whether in cash or other consideration).
Each Restricted Ordinary Share will automatically vest and be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to the Merger Consideration.
Each Unvested Non-IPO RSU and Unvested IPO RSU, in each case that is held by a non-employee
director of the Company, and each Vested Company PSU, Vested Company RSU and 2022 Bonus RSU
will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, based on
the Merger Consideration.
Each Transaction Bonus RSU and each Unvested IPO RSU that is held by an individual other than a
non-employee director of the Company will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, based on the Merger Consideration, payable on December 31, 2023,
subject to continued employment through the payment date, with accelerated vesting protection
upon a Qualifying Termination.
Each Unvested Company PSU, Unvested Closing RSU, Retention RSU and TRA RSU will
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, based on the
Merger Consideration, payable on December 31, 2024, subject to continued employment through the
payment date, with accelerated vesting protection upon a Qualifying Termination for each Unvested
Company PSU, Unvested Closing RSU and TRA RSU.
Each Unvested IPO Celebration RSU will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, based upon the Merger Consideration, payable on March 25, 2024, subject
to continued employment through the payment date.
Each Unvested Non-IPO RSU that is held by an individual other than a non-employee director of the
Company will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash, based on the
Merger Consideration, with 50% payable on December 31, 2023, and 50% payable on December 31,
2024, subject to continued employment through the payment date, with full accelerated vesting upon
a Qualifying Termination.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
All payments made in connection with the treatment of Diversey equity awards are subject to
withholding taxes as required by law.
The equity awards held by the Company’s directors and executive officers at the Effective Time will
generally be subject to the same treatment as the equity awards held by other holders, as such treatment is
described above. For an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards that would vest assuming that the
Merger occurs on May 11, 2023, and assuming that each of the named executive officers experiences a
Qualifying Termination on that date, see “Special Factors-Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” below. We estimate that the value of unvested
equity awards held by the two executive officers, other than the named executive officers, that would vest
assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 11, 2023, and that such two executive officers experience
Qualifying Terminations on that date is $2,342,970. In addition, such two executive officers were granted an
aggregate of 200,000 Retention RSUs, which are not included in the estimated value set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, as vesting and payment in respect of the Retention RSUs is subject to
continued employment through the vesting date, and the executive officers are not entitled to accelerated
vesting with respect to their Retention RSUs upon any termination that occurs prior to December 31, 2024;
therefore, such executive officers would not receive any payments with respect to their Retention RSUs
under the assumptions noted in the immediately preceding sentence. The Retention RSUs will be treated as
described in “Special Factors-Treatment of Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity Awards” and entitle
such two executive officers to payment in an aggregate amount of $1,680,000 (subject to any applicable
withholding taxes) on December 31, 2024, subject to their continued employment through such date. We
estimate that the aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Diversey
that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on May 11, 2023 is $2,414,714.
Severance Entitlements
Each of Messrs. Wieland and Herndon and Ms. Kwant is party to an employment agreement with a
subsidiary of Diversey. In the event of a termination without Cause (including, for Mr. Herndon, due to
Diversey’s non-renewal of his employment term) or, for Messrs. Wieland and Herndon, a termination for
“good reason”  (each as defined in the applicable employment agreement), each of Messrs. Wieland and
Herndon and Ms. Kwant is entitled to an amount equal to the sum of his or her (i) base salary and (ii) target
annual incentive opportunity, payable, for Mr. Wieland and Ms. Kwant, in either a lump sum or in ratable
installments over the 12-month post-termination period, and, for Mr. Herndon, in ratable installments over
the 12-month post termination period. Mr. Herndon is also entitled to 12 months of Company-subsidized
COBRA coverage (terminable earlier if he obtains other employment that offers group health benefits). The
severance entitlements for Messrs. Wieland and Herndon and Ms. Kwant are subject to their execution and
non-revocation of a release of claims and continued compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in
their respective employment agreements.
Each of Messrs. Redaelli, Verheul and Gundogdu is party to an offer letter with a subsidiary of Diversey.
The offer letters do not provide for severance, but Messrs. Redaelli, Verheul and Gundogdu are entitled to
severance in the event of a termination without Cause, with (a) Mr. Redaelli's severance determined pursuant
to Italy's statutory severance rules (which entitle him to an amount equal to the sum of (i) 42 months of his
base salary and (ii) his target annual incentive), (b) Mr. Verheul's severance determined pursuant to the
negotiated arrangement with the local works council (which entitles him to an amount equal to the sum of (i)
his base salary and (ii) average annual incentive paid for the three fiscal years immediately preceding his
termination) and (c) Mr. Gundogdu’s severance equals the sum of his (i) annual base salary and (ii) target
annual incentive opportunity and is payable in ratable installments over the 12-month post-termination
period.
Ms. Long is party to an offer letter with a subsidiary of Diversey that provides for severance
entitlements. In the event Ms. Long’s employment is terminated without “cause”  (as defined in the offer
letter), Ms. Long is entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of her (a) annual base salary and (b) target
annual incentive opportunity, payable in ratable installments over the 12-month post termination period. If
Ms. Long experiences a termination without “cause” or an “involuntary termination” prior to December 31,
2024, a pro-rata number of RSUs that were granted as a sign-on bonus will vest upon her date of termination
of employment. These severance entitlements are subject to Ms. Long’s execution and non-revocation of a
release

of claims, the provision of reasonable transition services following termination and continued compliance
with applicable restrictive covenants.
In connection with the Merger, Parent has acknowledged that as of the Effective Time, each of Messrs.
Wieland and Herndon will (i) have “good reason” immediately following the consummation of the Merger, (ii)
thereafter have the right to terminate employment for “good reason”, and (iii) be entitled to the rights and
benefits due to each of them upon a termination for “good reason”, in each case, subject to such executive
officer’s general release of claims in favor of Diversey and its subsidiaries (and their successors).
280G Mitigation Actions
Under the Merger Agreement, Diversey may, in consultation with Parent, implement strategies before
the Effective Time to mitigate the amount of potential “excess parachute payments” for “disqualified
individuals”  (each as defined in Section 280G of the Code), including the executive officers. As of the date of
this proxy statement, Diversey has not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of Section
280G of the Code on Diversey or any disqualified individuals. No executive officer is entitled to receive
gross-ups or tax reimbursements from Diversey with respect to any potential excise taxes.
Future Arrangements
Some or all of Diversey’s executive officers may discuss entering into agreements, arrangements or
understandings with Parent or its affiliates regarding the executive officer’s continuing employment or
compensation and benefits, including equity incentive arrangements, on a going-forward basis effective
upon and contingent upon the Closing. No such new agreements, arrangements or understandings have
been entered into as of the date of this proxy statement.
Golden Parachute Compensation
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the
compensation for each of the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the Merger, which is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules
and which is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of our shareholders, as described below in the section
entitled “Proposal 2. The Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal” beginning on
page 73. The individuals disclosed within this section and referred to as the “named executive officers” are
the Company’s current principal executive officer, current principal financial officer and three most highly
compensated executive officers (other than the principal executive officer and principal financial officer) as
disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form
10-K/A, filed with the SEC on April 27, 2023.
The amounts set forth in the table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement and in the footnotes to the table. As
a result, the actual amounts, if any, that a named executive officer will receive may materially differ from the
amounts set forth in the table. The calculations in the table below do not include amounts the Company’s
named executive officers were already entitled to receive or vested in as of the date hereof or amounts under
contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms or
operation in favor of executive officers and that are available generally to all the salaried employees of the
Company.
The table below assumes that (1) the Effective Time will occur on May 11, 2023 (the latest practicable
date before the filing of this proxy statement); (2) the employment of the named executive officer will be
terminated immediately following the Effective Time in a manner entitling the named executive officer to
receive severance payments and benefits under the terms of the named executive officer’s employment
arrangement; (3) the named executive officer’s base salary rate remains unchanged from the rate in place as
of May 11, 2023; (4) no named executive officer receives any additional equity grants on or prior to the
Effective Time; and (5) no named executive officer enters into new agreements or is otherwise legally entitled,
prior to the Effective Time, to additional compensation or benefits. For a narrative description of the terms
and conditions applicable to the payments quantified in the table below, see “Special Factors-​Treatment of
Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity Awards” and “Interests of the Company’s Directors

and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Entitlements” above. In addition to the equity grants
reflected in the table below, each of Ms. Kwant and Mr. Verheul were granted 100,000 Retention RSUs, which
will be treated as described in “Special Factors-Treatment of Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity
Awards” above and will entitle each of Ms. Kwant and Mr. Verheul to payment in the amount of $840,000
(subject to any applicable withholding taxes) on December 31, 2024, subject to their continued employment
through such date. The Retention RSUs are not included in the table below, however, as vesting and
payment in respect of the Retention RSUs is subject to continued employment through the vesting date, and
Ms. Kwant and Mr. Verheul are not entitled to accelerated vesting with respect to their Retention RSUs upon
any termination that occurs prior to December 31, 2024; therefore, Ms. Kwant and Mr. Verheul would not
receive any payments with respect to their Retention RSUs under the assumptions noted above. The table
below also does not include the Transaction Bonus RSUs, because none of our named executive officers are
expected to be granted any Transaction Bonus RSUs.

executive officer’s employment agreement or offer letter or pursuant to local law arrangements, as
applicable, as described above in the section entitled “Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Entitlements”. The base salary and target annual incentive

receive in connection with accelerated vesting and settlement of his or her equity awards, as described
above under the section entitled “Special Factors-Treatment of Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity
Awards” and in the paragraph and table below.
For Mr. Herndon, this amount reflects the 12 months of Company-subsidized COBRA coverage
provided under his employment agreement, as described above in the subsection entitled “Special
Factors-Severance Entitlements” and assumes that our cost for his continued COBRA coverage is equal
to approximately $3,024 per month.
The amounts in the “Equity” column attributable to Restricted Ordinary Shares and 2022 Bonus RSUs
are considered to be “single trigger,” because the Restricted Ordinary Shares and 2022 Bonus RSUs will vest

Rollover Agreement
As described elsewhere in this proxy statement, on March 8, 2023, concurrently with the execution of
the Merger Agreement, the Bain Shareholder separately entered into the Rollover Agreement with Topco,
pursuant to which (1) the Bain Shareholder has agreed to, immediately prior to the Effective Time, contribute,
transfer and assign all of its right, title and interest in the Rollover Shares to Topco (and, in certain
circumstances, a subsidiary of Topco), and (2) Topco has agreed to concurrently accept or, if applicable,
cause its subsidiary to accept, such Rollover Shares in exchange for the issuance to the Bain Shareholder of
certain common and preferred units of Topco (or, in certain circumstances described in the next sentence,
common units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco). Pursuant to the Rollover
Agreement, at the joint election of Topco and the Bain Shareholder, the parties may structure the exchange
so that in lieu of Topco issuing preferred units to the Bain Shareholder, the Bain Shareholder contributes,
transfers and assigns a portion of the Rollover Shares to a subsidiary of Topco in exchange for preferred
interests in such subsidiary, in which case following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Rollover Agreement, the Bain Shareholder would own common units of Topco and preferred interests in
such subsidiary. The Rollover Shares represent approximately 56.1% of the Ordinary Shares held by the Bain
Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (which amount is subject to increase up to approximately
61.5% if, prior to the Closing and pursuant to the Rollover Agreement, Topco elects to cause the Bain
Shareholder to contribute additional Ordinary Shares in exchange for additional preferred units of Topco (or,
in certain cases, a subsidiary of Topco)). The form of the Rollover Agreement is attached as Annex D to this
proxy statement. See “Special Factors-Rollover Agreement” beginning on page 62 of this proxy.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Diversey’s directors and executive officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies. See “The Merger-Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.”",70,76

The following summarizes certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that are
generally applicable to shareholders of Diversey who are U.S. Holders (as defined below). The following
discussion is based upon the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, and existing
administrative rulings and court decisions, each as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These
authorities are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. Any
change could affect the validity of the following discussion. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not
challenge one or more of the tax considerations described herein. We have not sought, and do not intend to
seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
following summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or
that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
This discussion is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation
that may be relevant to shareholders in light of their particular circumstances nor does it address any
aspects of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes, the alternative minimum tax, estate tax, or any aspects of the tax
on “net investment income” imposed under Section 1411 of the Code. This discussion also does not address
any special tax rules applicable to particular shareholders such as shareholders that are financial institutions,
tax-exempt organizations, S corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or
pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entities or arrangements),
insurance companies, dealers in securities or traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method
of accounting, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, shareholders who acquired
their Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of compensatory share options or otherwise in connection
with the performance of services, U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, U.S.
expatriates, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, any person who receives
consideration other than cash in the Merger (or any transaction related thereto), retirement plans or other
tax-deferred accounts, entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules, shareholders that own or have owned
(directly, indirectly or constructive) 5% of more of the Company’s common shares (including the Bain
Shareholder), shareholders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving
Company following the Merger, shareholders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item
of gross income with respect to the Ordinary Shares being taken into account in an “applicable financial
statement”  (as defined in Sections 56A and 451(b) of the Code) and shareholders who hold their Ordinary
Shares as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction, constructive sale or conversion transaction. The
following discussion does not address tax consequences to the persons subject to the base erosion and
anti-abuse tax. This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders who hold their Ordinary Shares as capital assets
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not
address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders who demand dissenter rights under Section 238
of CICA. In addition, the following discussion does not address non-income tax consequences or the tax
consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the Merger (whether
or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the Merger).
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Ordinary Shares that is (i)
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or an entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United
States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise treated as such for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source, or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United
58 TABLE OF CONTENTS
States and all of the substantial decisions of which one or more United States persons, as defined in Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the authority to control, or (b) that has a valid election in effect under the
applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a “United States person” under the Code.
If a partnership or another entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes is the owner of Ordinary Shares, the tax treatment of the partner or owner in such partnership or
other entity or arrangement will depend upon the status of the partner or owner, the activities of the
partnership or other entity or arrangement and certain determinations made at the partner or owner level.
Accordingly, partnerships and other entities or arrangements classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes that hold Ordinary Shares and partners or owners of such partnerships or other entities
or arrangements, as applicable, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the
Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH BELOW ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL
INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW AS OF THE DATE HEREOF.
HOLDERS OF ORDINARY SHARES ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT
OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.
In General
The Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. Subject to the discussion in the following
paragraph regarding the “passive foreign investment company” or “PFIC” rules, in general, a U.S. Holder will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the surrendered Ordinary Shares. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of
Ordinary Shares at different times or at different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine gain or loss
separately for each block of Ordinary Shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss
generally will be capital gain or loss, and any such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or
loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Ordinary Shares is greater than one (1) year as of the Closing.
A reduced rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. It is possible, however, that the IRS may
recharacterize a portion of the proceeds in a manner that results in a different character of income, including
ordinary income as a result of a recharacterization of the Merger consideration for tax purposes.
If the Company is a PFIC for the current taxable year or has been a PFIC during any prior taxable year in
which a U.S. Holder held Ordinary Shares, special rules would apply to such U.S. Holder’s disposition of
Ordinary Shares in the Merger. Generally, a foreign corporation will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year
in which (i) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income, or (ii) at least 50% of the value (for a publicly
traded foreign corporation, based on an average of the quarterly value of the assets) of its assets are
considered “passive assets”  (generally, assets that generate passive income). Based on the historic, current
and anticipated value of the Company’s assets and the composition of its income and assets, the Company
does not believe that it was a PFIC for the taxable year that ended on December 31, 2022 or the taxable year
that ended on December 31, 2021, nor does the Company expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year.
However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus, for the current taxable
year, will not be determinable until the close of the current taxable year. If, contrary to this expectation,
Diversey were to be treated as a PFIC for any applicable tax year during which a U.S. Holder held Ordinary
Shares, such classification could result in adverse tax consequences to such U.S. Holder different from the
U.S. federal income tax consequences described above. These adverse consequences include recognition of
ordinary income rather than capital gain from the disposition of Ordinary Shares, taxation at the highest rate
in effect for individuals or corporations, as applicable, and punitive interest charges. Generally, certain of the
adverse rules described above would not apply if such U.S. Holder had timely made, with respect to its
Ordinary Shares, (x) a mark-to-market election, or (y) a “qualified electing fund” election. There is no
assurance that we will provide information that will enable investors to make a qualified electing fund
election.
The application of the PFIC rules is complex and subject to uncertainty in several respects, and the
Company cannot assure you that the IRS will not take a contrary position with respect to any such taxable

It is presently anticipated that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related
Transactions will be approximately $4.6 billion, which will be funded via the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters, respectively, described below and the transactions contemplated by the Rollover
Agreement.
Parent and Merger Sub have represented to the Company that the Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letters and after giving effect to any “flex” provision in or related to the
Debt Commitment Letter (including with respect to fees and original issue discount) will provide Parent with
cash proceeds on the Closing Date of the Merger sufficient to pay the Required Amount.
Equity Financing
On March 8, 2023, Parent entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with each of the Platinum Entities,
pursuant to which the Platinum Entities have committed to, directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, capitalize Parent at the Closing with the Equity Financing. The Equity Financing is in
exchange, directly or indirectly, for equity securities of Parent or its affiliates, solely for the purpose of
funding, and to the extent necessary to fund, together with the net proceeds of the Debt Financing, all of the
amounts required to be paid by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement at the Closing, including the
aggregate consideration payable under the Merger Agreement to the Diversey shareholders, together with
related fees, costs and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company in
connection with the Transactions. The obligation of the Platinum Entities to make the Equity Financing is
subject to the satisfaction or waiver, prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing, of the following
conditions:
the satisfaction or waiver by Parent and Merger Sub of all conditions precedent set forth in the
Merger Agreement and described under “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger” to
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Closing (other than those conditions that
are by their terms to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied);

Financing sources having confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing (including any Alternative
Financing) is capable of being funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing; and
the concurrent Closing.
The Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that the Company is an express third-party
beneficiary thereof in connection with Diversey’s exercise of its rights related to specific performance under
the Merger Agreement. The Equity Commitment Letter provides that it may be amended in writing if signed
by the Company (with the prior approval of the Special Committee), the Platinum Entities and Parent,
provided that the Equity Commitment Letter may be amended by the Platinum Entities without written
consent of the Company to reflect any permitted assignment pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter.
Debt Financing
On March 8, 2023, the Borrower, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, received the Debt Commitment
Letter from Bank of America, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, committing to
provide to the Borrower, (x) an increase to the Borrower’s U.S. sub-facility under its existing asset-based
loan facility in an aggregate amount of $200,000,000, which has a maturity date of November 9, 2026 and
accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Borrower, either base rate or term SOFR
(including agreed to floors), plus an applicable margin agreed to by the lenders thereunder, (y) an
incremental term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000, which has a maturity date of
November 9, 2028 and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Borrower, either base
rate or term SOFR (including agreed to floors), plus an applicable margin agreed to by the lenders thereunder,
and (z) a senior secured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000,000 (which, at the
option of the Borrower, may take the form of senior secured notes), which may have an extended maturity
date of November 9, 2028 and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to term SOFR (including agreed to
floors), plus an applicable margin agreed to by the lenders thereunder, for the purpose of financing the
consideration for the Merger and paying fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger. The
Debt Commitment Letter was amended on March 31, 2023 to add additional initial Lenders party thereto.
The commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (x) the
date that is five business days after the Termination Date (including as extended in specified circumstances
under the Merger Agreement), (y) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms
prior to the consummation of the Merger and (z) as to any facility, the consummation of the Merger without
the use (or effectiveness) of such facility.
The proceeds of the Debt Financing will be used (x) to pay the cash portion of the consideration
pursuant to the Merger Agreement on the Closing Date, (y) to repay in full the Company Payoff
Indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries and release all related guarantees and security (in the case
of the PNC RPA, unless as otherwise agreed by the Borrower in its sole discretion) and (z) to pay fees,
commissions and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the Financing).
The obligation of the Lenders to provide the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter is
subject to a number of customary conditions, including, but not limited to:
the Merger shall have been or be consummated substantially concurrently with the initial funding of
the Debt Financing in accordance in all material respects with the Merger Agreement (without any
waiver or amendment thereof that is, in the aggregate when taken as a whole, materially adverse to
the interests of the initial Lenders, unless consented to by such initial Lenders);
the Equity Financing shall have been consummated, or substantially concurrently with the initial
funding of the Debt Financing, shall be consummated; and
subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the accuracy in all material respects as of the Closing of
certain specified representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and certain specified
representations and warranties in the loan documents.

One of the Demand Letters from a purported Company shareholder includes a draft complaint, which
names the Company and its directors as defendants. The draft complaint alleges, among other things, that
the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with
the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The potential plaintiff seeks as relief, among other things, injunctive relief
preventing defendants from filing a definitive proxy statement and from consummating the Merger unless
additional disclosures are made, rescission of the Merger in the event the Merger is consummated or
awarding of rescissory damages and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’

Our Board has fixed the close of business on May 11, 2023 as the record date for the purpose of
determining the shareholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting. Only
holders of record of Ordinary Shares on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the
Special Meeting. As of the record date, there were 324,579,219 Ordinary Shares outstanding and entitled to
vote and approximately 27 record holders of Ordinary Shares. Each Ordinary Share entitles its holder to one
vote on all matters properly coming before the Special Meeting.
A simple majority of the outstanding Ordinary Shares in issue, present in person or represented by
proxy, constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the proposals. Given that the Bain Shareholder
owns greater than 50% of the Ordinary Shares, the Special Meeting will be quorate unless the Bain
Shareholder or its successors and assigns or affiliates are not in attendance. Ordinary Shares held by
shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting but not voted, including
Ordinary Shares for which proxies have been duly executed, dated and received but for which shareholders
have abstained, will be treated as present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining the presence or
absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.",86,86

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Bain Shareholder, who held
approximately 73.0% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares as of May 11, 2023, delivered to the Company and
Parent the Voting Agreement, pursuant to which the Bain Shareholder agreed to vote all Ordinary Shares
owned or acquired by it prior to the record date in favor of the Merger Proposal and to terminate the Investor
Rights Agreement immediately prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Rollover

Holders of record of Ordinary Shares may vote their Ordinary Shares by attending the Special Meeting
and voting their Ordinary Shares in person. Alternatively, you may have your Ordinary Shares voted in one
of the following three ways, whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting:
by submitting a proxy by telephone by calling the toll-free telephone number on your proxy card and
following the telephone voting instructions;
by submitting a proxy over the Internet at the URL provided on your proxy card and following the
Internet voting instructions; or
by marking, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it in its accompanying
postage-paid envelope.
If you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, your voting instructions must be
received by 11:59 p.m. ET on June 7, 2023.
Submitting a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail will not prevent you from voting in person
at the Special Meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail,
even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, to ensure that your Ordinary Shares are represented at the
Special Meeting.
All Ordinary Shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the Special
Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in the manner specified by the holder. If you return a properly
signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your Ordinary Shares
will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal and “FOR” the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer
Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the
shareholders meeting, all Ordinary Shares represented by proxies received by the Company will be voted
with respect to such matter in accordance with the judgment of the persons named as in the proxies.
If your Ordinary Shares are held in “street name,” you will receive instructions from your brokerage firm,
bank or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your Ordinary Shares voted. If you have not
received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact
your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, as the case may be. Brokers who hold Ordinary Shares in “street
name” for a beneficial owner of those Ordinary Shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion
on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from the beneficial owner. However,
brokers are not allowed to vote with respect to the approval of matters that are “non-routine,” such as the
Merger Proposal, without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes, with respect to
any proposal, are Ordinary Shares held by a broker or other nominee present or represented at a meeting at
which at least one “routine” proposal is presented, but with respect to which the broker or other nominee is
not instructed by the beneficial owner of such Ordinary Shares to vote on the particular proposal and the
broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because all proposals for the Special
Meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, the Company anticipates that there will not be any broker
non-votes in connection with any proposal. If your broker or other nominee holds your Ordinary Shares in
“street name,” your broker or other nominee will vote your Ordinary Shares only if you

name” and you do not obtain a proxy from your broker or other nominee to vote such Ordinary Shares at the
Special Meeting and do not provide your broker or other nominee instructions on how to vote your Ordinary
Shares, your Ordinary Shares will not count towards quorum at the Special Meeting and thus will have no
effect on the outcome of any of the Special Meeting proposals. Please follow the directions on the voting

(Item 1 on the Proxy Card)
The Company is asking its shareholders to consider and vote on a proposal by special resolution to
authorize and approve the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger, and the Transactions. A copy of the
Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, and a copy of the Plan of Merger is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. You are urged to read each of the Merger Agreement and the
Plan of Merger carefully and in its entirety.
For a summary and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger
Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions throughout this proxy statement, including the
information set forth in the sections entitled “Special Factors” beginning on page 18 of this proxy statement
and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 75 of this proxy statement.
The Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously
recommends that the Company’s shareholders adopt the following proposal by special resolution.
The full text of the resolutions to be voted on is as follows:
“RESOLVED, as a special resolution that:
the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on March 8, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), by
and among the Company, Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. (“Parent”), acting by its general partner,
Olympus Water Holdings Limited, and Diamond Merger Limited, an exempted company
incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Merger Sub”), relating to the proposed
acquisition of the Company by Parent, be approved and confirmed in all respects;
the Plan of Merger, attached as an exhibit to the Merger Agreement and annexed hereto and
approved by resolution of the directors of the Company on March 7, 2023 and submitted to
members of the Company for their approval (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Plan of
Merger”) be approved and confirmed in all respects; and
the Company be authorized to merge with Merger Sub, so that the Company shall be the surviving
company and all the undertaking, property and liabilities of the Merger Sub shall vest in the
Company by virtue of such merger pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act (2023
Revision) of the Cayman Islands.”
Under Cayman Islands law, the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of
Ordinary Shares present and voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is
required to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions. The Company’s
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require shareholders holding a simple
majority of outstanding Ordinary Shares in issue to be present in person or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote in order to establish the required quorum to transact business. Given that the Bain
Shareholder owns greater than 50% of the Ordinary Shares, the Special Meeting will be quorate unless the
Bain Shareholder or its successors and assigns or affiliates are not in attendance. If you (i) attend the Special
Meeting in person or by proxy and abstain from voting, the effect will be, among other things, that your shares will
count towards the quorum at the Special Meeting, but will not count as a vote cast at the Special Meeting or (ii)(a) fail
to submit a proxy over the Internet, by telephone, by mail or otherwise fail to attend the Special Meeting and cast your
vote in person or (b) fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, your shares will
not count towards quorum at the Special Meeting, and if a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of the
Merger Proposal.
The Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously
approved the Merger, and determined that the Merger is in the best interests of the Company and the
Unaffiliated Shareholders and unanimously resolved to recommend that the Company’s shareholders

authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions. See “Special Factors-​
Recommendation of the Diversey Board of Directors and Special Committee” beginning on page 27 of this
proxy statement.

(Item 2 on the Proxy Card)
The Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal gives shareholders the
opportunity to vote on an advisory and non-binding basis on the compensation that the named executive
officers may be entitled to receive that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. This compensation is
summarized in the table and the footnotes thereto under “Special Factors-Interests of the Company’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 55 of
this proxy statement.
The Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation
information disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Board unanimously recommends that the Company’s shareholders adopt the following proposal by
ordinary resolution:
“RESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution, that the shareholders of Diversey Holdings, Ltd. hereby
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation to be paid or become payable to its named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed in the Company’s proxy
statement pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the section entitled “Golden Parachute
Compensation” and the corresponding table and the footnotes thereto.”
The vote on the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation
Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to
approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the advisory and non-binding Named Executive
Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Named Executive
Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company
or Parent. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions are authorized and
the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the Company’s shareholders.
The advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal will
require the affirmative vote of at least a simple majority of votes cast by the holders of Ordinary Shares
present and voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. If you (i) attend the
Special Meeting in person or by proxy and abstain from voting, the effect will be, among other things, that your shares
will count towards the quorum at the Special Meeting, but will not count as a vote cast at the Special Meeting, or (ii)(a)
fail to submit a proxy over the Internet, by telephone, by mail or otherwise fail to attend the Special Meeting and cast
your vote in person or (b) fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, your shares
will not count towards quorum at the Special Meeting, and if a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of
the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.
The Board unanimously recommends that holders of Ordinary Shares vote “FOR” the advisory and non-binding
Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares
and the Bain Shares) will automatically be cancelled and exchanged into the right to receive $8.40 in cash,

Company Share will automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor and each Bain Share will automatically be cancelled and exchanged into the right
to receive $7.84 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Rollover
Shares will be exchanged by the Bain Shareholder for common and preferred units of Topco (or, in certain

Agent. At or prior to Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent the cash
funds necessary to pay for the Ordinary Shares entitled to, and exchanged into, the right to receive the

any former holder of Ordinary Shares entitled to payment of the Merger Consideration or Bain Consideration,
as applicable, who had not theretofore surrendered or transferred Ordinary Shares in book-entry form (as the
case may be) will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration or Bain
Consideration, as applicable (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws), as a
general creditor thereof. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such certificates or Ordinary
Shares in book-entry form for five years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior

agreed to by the respective parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement,
including information contained in the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company Disclosure Letter
contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties
set forth in the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, some of those representations and warranties may not be
accurate or complete as of any particular date because they are subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from that generally applicable to public disclosures to shareholders. Moreover,
certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating
risk between the Company, Merger Sub and Parent rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly,
you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of
the actual state of facts about the Company, Merger Sub or Parent. This description of the representations
and warranties is included to provide shareholders with additional information regarding the terms of the

the exclusivity and terms of the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub.
Materiality Standards. Many of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by
the Company are qualified by a “materiality” or “Company Material Adverse Effect” standard (that is, they
will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the
aggregate, would, as the case may be, be material or have a material adverse effect on the Company). For
purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Company Material Adverse Effect” generally refers to any change,
event, development, effect or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
However, the standard of “material adverse effect” on the Company generally excludes any adverse
effect to the extent resulting from or arising out of:
changes in general economic conditions, or changes in conditions in the global, international or
regional economy generally;

each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Transactions, other than any
legal proceedings among the parties related to the Merger Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter; and
any breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub.
In the case of the exclusions listed in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and
eleventh bullets above, the Merger Agreement provides that if such effect has had a disproportionate
adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other companies of a similar
size operating in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries conduct business, then such
effect may be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred,
but only to the extent such incremental disproportionate adverse effect is not excluded by the other
exceptions to a Company Material Adverse Effect described above.
Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub. In the Merger Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub made customary representations and warranties to the Company with respect to, among other
things:

the requisite power and authority of Parent and Merger Sub to execute and deliver the Merger
Agreement, perform their respective obligations thereunder and consummate the Merger;

to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or existence of certain liens;

Merger Sub’s (a) execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement; (b) performance of their respective
obligations under the Merger Agreement or (c) consummation of the Merger, subject to certain
exceptions;

the Transactions;
the absence of any vote or consent of the holders of any share capital of Parent necessary to approve
the Merger Agreement, Plan of Merger or the Merger; and

Materiality Standards. Many of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by
Parent and Merger Sub are qualified by a “materiality” or “Parent Material Adverse Effect” standard (that is,
they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in
the aggregate, would, as the case may be, prevent or materially impair or delay, or would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or delay, the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under the Merger Agreement or to consummate the Transactions).
The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and in any certificate delivered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement will not survive the Effective Time (including any rights arising out of
any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements (and there shall be no liability

The Merger Agreement provides that from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will, and will cause its

respective other Representatives to:

For the purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” means any offer or proposal (other
than an offer or proposal by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates) to engage in an
Acquisition Transaction, and “Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction involving:
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or group of Ordinary Shares,
whether from the Company or any other person, representing more than 20% of the Ordinary Shares
outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or group that, if consummated in
accordance with its terms, would result in such person or group beneficially owning more than 20% of
the Ordinary Shares outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange
offer;
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or group, or equityholders of any
such person or group, of assets constituting or accounting for more than 20% of the consolidated
assets, net income or consolidated revenue of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole
(measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition); or
any merger, consolidation, business combination, joint venture, repurchase, redemption, share
exchange, extraordinary dividend or distribution, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to
which any person or group, or shareholders of any such person or group, is issued, or directly or
indirectly acquires record or beneficial ownership of, securities representing more than 20% of the
outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof) after giving effect to the
consummation of such transaction, in each case other than the Merger.
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will be required to enforce, and will not be permitted to
waive, terminate or modify, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits or
purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Board (or any committee thereof), unless the Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel), that failure to take such action (1)
would prohibit the counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to the Board (or any
committee thereof) in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement and (2) would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law.",102,103

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, during the Fiduciary Out
Period (which period expired on April 19, 2023) the Company and the Board, or the Special Committee, was
permitted to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its

Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal if requested by such person,
provided that:
such Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a material breach of the obligations described under
“The Merger Agreement-Non-Solicitation”; and
the Board or the Special Committee had determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constituted a Superior
Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take
such actions were reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Board’s or the Special Committee’s, as
applicable, fiduciary duties under applicable law.
No such proposals were received prior to the expiration of the Fiduciary Out Period on April 19, 2023.

Subject to the provisions described below, the Board and Special Committee have unanimously
recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting. The Board also
agreed to include the Board Recommendation and the Special Committee Recommendation in this proxy
statement. Subject to the provisions described below, the Merger Agreement provides that neither the Board
nor any committee of the Board will:
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify,
the Board Recommendation or the Special Committee Recommendation;
fail to include the Board Recommendation or the Special Committee Recommendation in this proxy
statement;
fail to publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation or the Special Committee Recommendation within
10 business days following the written request of Parent (provided, however, that Parent may make
such request no more than twice plus one time more each time an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or
material modification thereto shall have become publicly known);
publicly adopt, endorse, approve or recommend (or publicly propose to adopt, endorse, approve or
recommend) an Acquisition Proposal; or
make any recommendation in support of or, within 10 business days following its commencement, fail
to recommend against, a tender or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal.
Each of the foregoing actions is referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change.” In addition, the
Board may not, nor any committee thereof will, cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the provisions described above, the Merger Agreement does not prohibit the Board or
Special Committee from (i) making a “stop, look and listen” communication to shareholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) determining that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and does not prohibit the Company from delivering any notice

will any of the following constitute, or be taken into account in determining the existence of, an Intervening
Event: (A) the fact alone that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published forecasts or
projections for any period (however, the underlying reasons for such events may constitute an Intervening
Event), (B) any changes in the market price or trading volume of Ordinary Shares, in and of itself, after the
date of the Merger Agreement (however, the underlying reasons for such events may constitute an
Intervening Event) or (C) changes in conditions in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries
conduct business, including changes in conditions in the hygiene, infection prevention or cleaning
solutions industries generally, except to the extent that such changes have had or would expected to have a
disproportionate effect on the Company relative to other companies of a similar size operating in industries
in which the Company and its subsidiaries conduct business.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Board or the Special Committee may not effect such an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless:
the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five business days in advance to the
effect that the Board or the Special Committee intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change,
which notice shall specify the basis for such Adverse Recommendation Change, including a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event;
prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, during such five-business-day period, the
Company has negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith to allow Parent to offer
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Commitment Letters
in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event; and
following such five business-day time period, the Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account Parent’s
proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Commitment Letters
and any other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure of the Board or
the Special Committee, as applicable, to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that each time material
modifications to the Intervening Event occur, the Company shall notify Parent of such modification
and the time period described in the preceding bullet and in this bullet will recommence, provided that
such time period will be three business days from the day of such notification (instead of five
business days).
Acquisition Proposal
Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement, if the Company has received an
unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a breach of the obligations
described under “The Merger Agreement-Non-Solicitation” that the Board or Special Committee, as
applicable, has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, may (A)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; and/or (B) cause the
Company to terminate the Merger Agreement and/or (C) cause the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal substantially concurrently; provided,
however, that the Board or Special Committee, as applicable, were only permitted to take the foregoing
actions described in clauses (B) and (C) during the Fiduciary Out Period and were not permitted to take any
of the foregoing actions unless:
the Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

the Company had complied in all material respects with its obligations relating to non-solicitation and
the Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal;
the Company had provided prior written notice to Parent five business days in advance (the “Notice
Period”) to the effect that the Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, (A) had received an
Acquisition Proposal that had not been withdrawn; (B) had concluded in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constituted a Superior Proposal; and (C) had resolved to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purposes of entering into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, which notice must have identified the person or group making such Superior Proposal
and included the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant agreements relating to such Superior
Proposal;
during the Notice Period, the Company had negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and the Commitment Letters in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect an Adverse

Although the availability of the Financing is not a condition precedent to the obligations of Parent to
consummate the Merger (provided, that the funding of the Debt Financing is a condition precedent, amongst
others described under the heading “The Merger Agreement-Specific Performance”, to the Company’s right
to obtain specific performance or other equitable remedy under the Merger Agreement to compel Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger), each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have agreed to take
certain actions in connection with the arrangement of the Equity Financing and Debt Financing for the
Merger.
Obligations of Parent. The Merger Agreement provides that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take and shall cause its subsidiaries and Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Financing, including to (i) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated timing of
the Marketing Period) all terms and conditions applicable to Parent and Borrower set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter (including Definitive Agreements related thereto and, to
the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter, any “flex” terms contained in the related fee letter),
respectively, that are to be satisfied by it to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including
the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt
Financing, (ii) maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters, negotiate and enter into Definitive
Agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until reasonably
necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing) with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (other than modifications to terms as are acceptable
to Parent and which do not contain any Prohibited Modifications (as defined below in this section entitled
“The Merger Agreement-Financing Arrangements”)), (iii) comply with its obligations under the Commitment
Letters and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if funds
in the amounts and on the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, in whole or in part, become
unavailable to Parent or the Borrower regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within three business days thereof) notify the Company in writing of such
unavailability and the reason therefor, and use its reasonable best efforts, and cause each of its subsidiaries
and Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts, to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable,
Alternative Financing in amounts (after taking into consideration the amount of the Financing that is
available) equal to or greater than the Required Amount and which does not include any Prohibited
Modifications. Such Alternative Financing will be subject to the same obligations of the Debt Financing
under the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement provides that, in the event that (1) any portion of the Debt Financing structured
as permanent financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, (2) all conditions to Closing of
Parent

TABLE OF CONTENTS
and Merger Sub have been satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing and those
conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement) and (3) the bridge facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with the
Merger Agreement) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used promptly in lieu of such affected portion
of the permanent financing.
The Merger Agreement prohibits Parent from terminating or causing the termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreement, and replacing, amending, supplementing, modifying or waiving
any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company if such replacement, supplement, modification, amendment or waiver (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (when taken together with the Equity Financing) to less than the
Required Amount, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions, or otherwise adversely modifies or expands any
of the conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (iii) adversely affects the ability of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or (iv) effects any other
amendment, modification or waiver that would reasonably be expected to delay the Closing beyond the date
the Closing is required to occur under the Merger Agreement or prevent the Closing or impede the ability of
Parent to consummate the Closing (collectively, the “Prohibited Modifications”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may, without the written consent of the Company (a) amend the Debt Commitment Letter
solely to add additional Debt Financing sources that have not previously executed the Debt Commitment
Letter and to grant to such additional Debt Financing sources customary approval rights, (b) amend the
Definitive Agreements solely to give effect to any “flex” terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and
(c) amend the Debt Commitment Letter solely to amend the titles, allocations and fee sharing arrangements
with respect to existing and additional Debt Financing sources. Further, the Merger Agreement prohibits
Parent from amending, altering or waiving, or agreeing to amend, alter or waive, any term of the Equity
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company, provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Equity Commitment Letter may be amended by the Platinum Entities without written consent of
the Company to reflect any permitted assignment pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter.
Financing Cooperation by the Company. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company has agreed to use
its reasonable best efforts to provide such assistance and to cause its subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to provide such assistance as is customary and reasonably requested by Parent, and
subject to Parent’s reimbursement obligations under the Merger Agreement, in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing for purposes of consummating the Merger, including, among other
things, using reasonable best efforts to:
as promptly as reasonably practicable furnish Parent and the Debt Financing sources with (A) the
Required Information (as defined below in this section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Financing
Arrangements”), (B) customary “flash” or “recent development” revenue information (which may be
provided in a reasonable range or estimate and may be provided on a non-GAAP basis) for any fiscal
quarter ending after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Closing, and (C) to the extent
in possession of the Company, such other financial and other pertinent information pertaining to the
Company and its subsidiaries;
solely with respect to financial information and data derived from the Company’s historical books and
records and maintained in the ordinary course of business, provide Parent with information necessary
to prepare the pro forma financial statement required by the Debt Commitment Letter;
prepare for and participate in (through management with appropriate seniority and expertise) a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions,
sessions with rating agencies and other customary syndication activities in connection with the Debt
Financing, at reasonable times and with reasonable advance notice, and in each case which shall be
virtual unless otherwise agreed to by the Company in its reasonable discretion;

material misstatements or omissions) and customary CFO and similar certificates and certificates with
respect to certain financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries in the offering documents
not otherwise covered by a “comfort” letter to the extent reasonably requested by the underwriters of
such offering, and providing reasonable cooperation with the due diligence efforts of the Debt
Financing sources to the extent reasonable and customary;
execute and deliver definitive documents and closing certificates relating to the Debt Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and as are customarily required to be delivered under such
definitive financing documentation for financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter; and
take all corporate or company action, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested
by Parent that are necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing,
including any high yield financing, and to permit the proceeds thereof, to be made available at the
Closing Date to consummate the Transactions.
Company Payoff Indebtedness. If requested by Parent in writing at least 10 business days in advance of
the Closing, the Company has agreed to, or to procure that the Issuer will, prior to the Closing: (i) send any
Redemption Notices with respect to all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes
(which shall be in the form required under the Senior Notes Indenture and conditioned upon the
consummation of the Closing) (together with any customary ancillary documents required by the Senior
Notes Indenture for such redemption) to the Trustee, providing (A) for the redemption on the Closing Date
and/or (B) for satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture on the Closing
Date, in each case, pursuant to the requisite provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture (subject to the
consummation of the Closing) (each of clauses (A) and (B), the “Redemption”), (ii) reasonably cooperate
with Parent pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture to facilitate such Redemption and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to cooperate and facilitate such Redemption. Any Redemption
effectuated pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be funded using consideration provided by Parent or its
subsidiaries and Parent’s fees and out-of-pocket expenses will not be paid by the Company or its
subsidiaries and, in no event, will the Company or the Issuer be required to (x) pay or deposit any amounts
required to redeem or discharge the Senior Notes except to the extent such amounts have been previously
provided, or are being concurrently provided, to the Company or the Issuer by Parent or its subsidiaries for
such purpose or (y) issue any Redemption Notices prior to the Closing, except for such notice that is
permitted to be conditioned (and is so conditioned) on the occurrence of the Closing.
The Company has also agreed to, if requested in writing by Parent, use reasonable best efforts to, or
use reasonable best efforts to procure that the Issuer will, prior to the Closing: (i) commence one or more
Offers to Purchase and (ii) conduct Consent Solicitations; provided that (x) any such transaction will be
funded using consideration provided by Parent and the dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent,
depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations
will be retained by Parent and their fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by Parent, (y) Parent
will be responsible for all other liabilities and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with any Company Notes Offers and Consent Solicitations (including all amounts payable to the
holders of the Senior Notes in connection therewith), and (z) no Company Notes Offers and Consent
Solicitations will be consummated prior to Effective Time and the closing of any Company Notes Offers and
Consent Solicitations will be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time.

requested by Parent that is necessary or reasonably required in connection with a Company Note Offer and
Consent Solicitation, including, without limitation, (i) to the extent required by the policies or procedures of
the Depository Trust Company in connection with any Company Note Offer and Consent Solicitation, (ii)
using reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to enter such supplemental indenture prior or
substantially simultaneously with execution thereof by the Company, and (iii) providing the information
necessary to distribute the applicable Company Note Offer and Consent Solicitation documents to the

of) (i) no later than one business day prior to the Closing Date, draft payoff letters to Parent, and (ii) on or
prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver (or cause the delivery of) to Parent executed payoff

conditioned on the Closing, and any other necessary authorizations, releases or terminations reasonably
required to evidence the satisfaction of such Company Payoff Indebtedness and the release or termination of
any liens in connection therewith.
Marketing Period. Marketing Period, a time allotted to Parent and Merger Sub for purposes of
marketing the Debt Financing, means the first period of fifteen consecutive business days after the date of
the Merger Agreement and throughout and on the last day of which Parent shall have the Required
Information and such Required Information is and remains Compliant (as defined below in this section
entitled “The Merger Agreement-Financing Arrangements”); provided, that (1) the Marketing Period shall
not be deemed to have commenced if, after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the completion of
the first such fifteen consecutive business day period, (x) the Required Information ceases to be Compliant
for any reason, in which case the Marketing Period will not be deemed to have commenced until Parent has
received all of the Required Information and such Required Information is Compliant or (y) the Company has
been informed by the Company’s independent auditors that the Company is required to restate, or the
Company shall have announced any intention to restate, any financial statements included in the Required
Information or that such restatement is under consideration, in which case the Marketing Period will not be
deemed to have commenced until such restatement has been completed and the relevant Required
Information has been amended or the Company has concluded that no restatement is required in accordance
with GAAP and (2) the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which securities in
an amount sufficient to replace the secured bridge commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter have
been funded in full, taking into account, for the purposes of this clause (2) only, any amounts (if any) of the
Debt Financing funded into escrow; provided, further, that upon completion of the first fifteen consecutive
business day period described above, the Marketing Period shall not re-start; provided, further, that (x) July

Marketing Period shall not commence until on or following September 5, 2023 and (z) if the Marketing Period
is not completed on or prior to December 20, 2023, the Marketing Period will not commence until on or
following January 2, 2024. If the Company in good faith reasonably believes that it has delivered the
Required Information, it may deliver to Parent written notice to that effect (stating the date on which it
believes it completed any such delivery), in which case the receipt of the Required Information shall be
deemed to have occurred and (subject to the continuing applicability of the limitations and requirements set
forth above) the fifteen consecutive business day period described above shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date of receipt of such notice, unless Parent determines in good faith that the Company
has not completed delivery of the Required Information and, within three business days after its receipt of
such notice from the Company, Parent delivers written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with
reasonable specificity which information is required to complete the delivery of the Required Information).
As used in the Merger Agreement, “Required Information” means, subject to certain exclusions, (i) the
financial statements necessary to satisfy certain conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, which
financial statements shall include such financial statements of the Company for each of the fiscal quarters
ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 (it being understood that all such financial statements shall be
deemed to have been provided to Parent on the date such financial statements are publicly filed by the

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries will, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill the obligations of the Company and
any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any written indemnification agreements between the Company and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or
employees, on the other hand (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the six-year
period following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries must maintain in effect
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions in their respective organizational
documents which are at least as favorable as the provisions contained in such organizational documents of
the Company and its subsidiaries as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent and the Surviving Company will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against
any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, penalties,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with
any legal proceeding arising out of (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate, or (ii) any action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, including in connection with the Merger or taken at the
request of the Company or such subsidiary or affiliate, regardless of whether such action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time. In connection with any such
proceeding, Parent or the Surviving Company will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and
expenses of any counsel) as incurred by any Indemnified Person in defense of such proceeding upon receipt
of an undertaking from such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified.
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Company, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to maintain in effect the Company’s current D&O
Insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with
respect to coverage conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance; provided, that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and
officers than the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) request that the
92 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time). The Surviving Company will not be obligated to pay any amounts which
would exceed 300% of the amount paid by the Company for its last full policy period under its existing D&O
policy. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the
D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not
exceed the 300% cap described in the foregoing sentence, which, in such case, the Surviving Company shall
maintain in full force and effect for so long as such tail policy is in full force and effect in lieu of maintaining
the D&O Insurance.",111,112

Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company will afford Parent and its Representatives
(including financing sources) reasonable access during normal business hours (upon reasonable advance
request provided in writing) to the properties, books and records and personnel and consultants of the
Company and its subsidiaries and, subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, to the computer
systems, including data and personnel, with the reasonable support and cooperation of the Company, to
commence with integration planning in anticipation and furtherance of the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may restrict or prohibit access to documents or
information solely to the extent that (i) any applicable law or contract requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (ii) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
privilege applicable to such documents or information; (iii) such disclosure relates to interactions with other
prospective buyers of the Company or the negotiation of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, or
information relating to the analysis, valuation or consideration of the Transactions; (iv) access to a contract
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a
default pursuant to, or give a third person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such
contract; (v) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties; or (vi) such
documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse legal proceeding between the Company
and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its affiliates, on the other hand; provided that the
Company will give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and use
its reasonable best efforts to allow disclosure in a manner that would not violate any of the foregoing
clauses. The Merger Agreement requires Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives to hold
and treat all documents and information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries that was furnished in
connection with the Merger in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered into by the
parties in connection the Merger negotiations.
Certain Tax Audits. From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company will notify Parent of certain material tax actions, Parent
will have the right to participate in such material tax actions (at its sole cost and expense), and the Company
and its Subsidiaries will not resolve, settle, compromise or abandon any material tax action without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E-3 and The Special Meeting. The Merger Agreement requires the
Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the
Company) to prepare and file the preliminary proxy statement relating to the Special Meeting with the SEC as
promptly as practical following the date of the Merger Agreement (and, in any event within 25 business
days). Further, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate to, concurrently
with the preparation and filing of this proxy statement, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a Schedule 13E-3
relating to the Transactions. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause this proxy statement,
the Schedule 13E-3 and any other filing required by the SEC to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq. The Company may
not make any such filing with the SEC unless it has provided Parent and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such filing and has considered all reasonable additions, deletions, or
changes suggested thereto in good faith. The Company is required to call the Special Meeting as described
under “-The Special Meeting.”

Public Announcements. Each party to the Merger Agreement is required to receive the consent of both
the Company (which consent shall have been approved by the Special Committee) and Parent prior to
issuing any press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions, or statements directed

may be required by applicable law, court process or the applicable rules of Nasdaq and subject to certain
limited exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Shareholder Litigation. Until the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the

any party compromise or settle, or agree to compromise or settle, any such litigation unless the other parties
have consented in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Further, no party will, without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Person (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle any claims in connection with any litigation relating
to the Transactions against such Indemnified Person unless the settlement solely involves the payment of
money by persons other than such Indemnified Person and includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Person from liability on all matters that are the subject of such litigation relating to the
Transactions.
Antitrust and Foreign Antitrust Approvals. The Merger Agreement requires each of Parent and Merger
Sub (and their respective controlled affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and its
subsidiaries, if applicable), on the other hand, (i) to file the applicable Premerger Notification and Report

“Special Factors-Regulatory Approvals.” Each of Parent and the Company are required to (i) cooperate and
coordinate (and shall cause its respective controlled affiliates and subsidiaries, respectively, to cooperate
and coordinate) with the other in determining whether any such filings are required and the making of such

Investor Rights Agreement
Diversey is a party to the Investor Rights Agreement with the Bain Shareholder and certain co-investors
and members of management who hold Ordinary Shares. Under the Investor Rights Agreement, dependent
upon its beneficial share ownership, the Bain Shareholder has the right, among other rights, to nominate a
minimum number of members of the Board. The number of directors the Bain Shareholder is entitled to
nominate pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement is determined by a ratio, expressed as a percentage
which equals the number of Ordinary Shares directly or indirectly held by the Bain Shareholder divided by
the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares that were outstanding immediately following the closing of the IPO
(such percentage, the “Bain Capital Ownership Percentage”). Based upon the Bain Capital Ownership
Percentage, the Bain Shareholder is entitled to appoint either a number of directors equal to a percentage of
the total number of directors on the Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number) or a specific number of
directors, as shown below:

of the Board. As long as the Bain Shareholder has the right to nominate at least one director to the Board, it
has the right to designate at least one member serving on each committee of the Board.
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Bain Capital Ownership Percentage is greater than 40% and,

DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT (2023 REVISION) OF THE CAYMAN
ISLANDS
The following is a summary of the rights of the holders of record of Ordinary Shares of the Company to dissent
from the Merger and receive payment of the fair value of their Ordinary Shares (the “Dissenters’ Rights”). This
summary is not a complete statement of the law, and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 238 of the
CICA, a copy of which is attached as Annex H to this proxy statement. If you are contemplating the possibility of
dissenting from the Merger and exercising your Dissenters’ Rights, you should carefully review the text of Annex H,
particularly the procedural steps required to exercise Dissenters’ Rights. These procedures are complex and you
should consult your Cayman Islands legal counsel. If you do not fully and precisely satisfy and perfect the procedural
requirements of the CICA, you will lose your Dissenters’ Rights.
A shareholder of the Company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his, her or its Ordinary Shares upon
dissenting from the Merger, provided that such shareholder follows the procedures summarized below:
you must give a written notice of objection (a “Written Objection”) to the Company prior to a vote
to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions. The Written
Objection must include a statement that you propose to demand payment for your Ordinary Shares
if the Merger is authorized by the resolution at the extraordinary general meeting;
within 20 days immediately following the date on which the vote authorizing the Merger is made,
the Company must give written notice of the authorization (the “Approval Notice”) to all
shareholders who have served a Written Objection;
within 20 days immediately following the date on which the Approval Notice is given (the “Dissent
Period”), the dissenting shareholder must give a written notice of his, her or its decision to dissent
(a “Notice of Dissent”) to the Company stating his, her or its name and address, the number and
classes of Ordinary Shares with respect to which he, she or it dissents and a demand for payment
of the fair value of such Ordinary Shares. The shareholder will cease to have any rights of a
shareholder upon the giving of such Notice of Dissent except the right to be paid the fair value of
his, her or its Ordinary Shares (and the right to participate in court proceedings to determine the
fair value of his, her or its Ordinary Shares or the right to institute proceedings on the grounds that
the Merger is void or unlawful). A dissenting shareholder must dissent in respect of all the
Ordinary Shares which he or she holds;
within seven days immediately following (i) the date of expiry of the Dissent Period or (ii) the date
on which the Plan of Merger is filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands,
whichever is later, the Company, as the Surviving Company, must make a written offer (a “Fair Value
Offer”) to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his, her or its Ordinary Shares at a price
determined by the Company to be the fair value of such Ordinary Shares;
if, within 30 days immediately following the date of the Fair Value Offer, the Company and the
dissenting shareholder agree upon the price to be paid for his, her or its Ordinary Shares, the
Company shall pay the shareholder the amount in money;
if, within 30 days immediately following the date of the Fair Value Offer, the Company and the
dissenting shareholder fail to agree on a price at which the Company will purchase the dissenting
shareholder’s Ordinary Shares, then, within 20 days immediately following the date of the expiry of
such 30-day period, the Company must, and the dissenting shareholder may, file a petition with the
Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Grand Court”) for a determination of the fair value of the
Ordinary Shares held by all dissenting shareholders who have served a Notice of Dissent and who
have not agreed with the Company as to fair value, and the petition by the Company must be
accompanied by a verified list containing the names and address of all shareholders who filed a
Notice of Dissent and who have not agreed with the Company as to the fair value of their Ordinary
Shares (the “Verified List”). A copy of the petition must be served on the other party. If the petition
is filed by a dissenting shareholder, the Company must file the Verified List with the Grand Court
within 10 days after the service of the petition; and

if, within 30 days immediately following the date of the Fair Value Offer, the Company and the
dissenting shareholder agree upon the price to be paid for his, her or its Ordinary Shares, the
Company shall pay the shareholder the amount in money;
if, within 30 days immediately following the date of the Fair Value Offer, the Company and the
dissenting shareholder fail to agree on a price at which the Company will purchase the dissenting
shareholder’s Ordinary Shares, then, within 20 days immediately following the date of the expiry of
such 30-day period, the Company must, and the dissenting shareholder may, file a petition with the
Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Grand Court”) for a determination of the fair value of the
Ordinary Shares held by all dissenting shareholders who have served a Notice of Dissent and who
have not agreed with the Company as to fair value, and the petition by the Company must be
accompanied by a verified list containing the names and address of all shareholders who filed a
Notice of Dissent and who have not agreed with the Company as to the fair value of their Ordinary
Shares (the “Verified List”). A copy of the petition must be served on the other party. If the petition
is filed by a dissenting shareholder, the Company must file the Verified List with the Grand Court
within 10 days after the service of the petition; and
111 vii. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
if a petition is timely filed and served, the Grand Court will determine the fair value of the Ordinary
Shares held by the dissenting shareholders as it finds are involved (together with a fair rate of
interest, if any) and the costs of the proceeding and the allocation of such costs upon the parties.
Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the Verified List and who the Grand Court
finds are involved may participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is
reached.
You must be a registered holder of Ordinary Shares in order to exercise your Dissenters’ Rights. All notices and
petitions must be executed by or for the shareholder of record, fully and correctly, as such shareholder’s name appears
on the register of shareholders of the Company. As noted above, a dissenting shareholder must dissent in respect of all
the Ordinary Shares which he, she or it holds. If the Ordinary Shares are registered in the name of a person who
holds them in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, these notices must be executed by or for
the fiduciary. If the Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of more than one person, such notices and petitions
must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may
execute the notices or petitions for a shareholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner and
expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the notice, he is acting as agent for the record owner. A PERSON
HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN ORDINARY SHARES WHICH ARE REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF
ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE, AND WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE
DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS DIRECTLY IN RESPECT OF SUCH SHARES, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CONTACT
SUCH PERSON IN ORDER TO BECOME THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF SUCH SHARES, IN ORDER TO BE
ABLE TO EXERCISE SUCH DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF SUCH SHARES.
If you do not satisfy each of these requirements, you cannot exercise Dissenters’ Rights and will receive the per
share Merger Consideration of $8.40 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each
Ordinary Share you hold. You must send all notices to Diversey Holdings, Ltd., 1300 Altura Road, Suite 125, Fort Mill,
SC 29708.
If you are considering dissenting, you should be aware that the fair value of your Ordinary Shares determined
under Section 238 of the CICA could be more than, the same as, or less than the $8.40 in cash, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes, for each Ordinary Share that you would otherwise receive as consideration in
the Merger. In addition, in any proceedings for determination of the fair value of Ordinary Shares covered by a Notice
of Dissent, the Company intends to assert that the per share Merger Consideration of $8.40 is equal to the fair value of
each of your Ordinary Shares.
The provisions of Section 238 of the CICA are technical and complex. If you fail to comply strictly with the
procedures set forth in Section 238 of the CICA, you will lose your Dissenters’ Rights. You should consult your
Cayman Islands legal counsel if you wish to exercise Dissenters’ Rights.

If the Merger is completed, Diversey will have no public shareholders and there will be no public
participation in any future meetings of shareholders of Diversey. However, if the Merger is not completed,
shareholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in shareholder meetings.
Diversey does not intend to hold an annual general meeting in 2023 unless the Merger is not completed.
In order to be considered for inclusion in Diversey’s proxy statement for its 2023 annual general
meeting, if held, shareholder proposals must comply with Rule 14a-8(e) of the Exchange Act. The deadline to
receive shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8(e) of the Exchange Act to be considered for inclusion in
Diversey’s 2023 proxy statement for the 2023 annual general meeting was November 23, 2022 (which is 120
calendar days before the date Diversey’s proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with
the 2022 annual general meeting). If the date of the 2023 annual general meeting is changed by more than 30
days from the anniversary date of the 2022 annual general meeting (which was held on May 4, 2022), then the
deadline will be a reasonable time before Diversey begins to print and mail proxy materials.
In addition, Diversey’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association include advance
notice provisions relating to shareholder nominations for directors or other business not submitted for
inclusion in Diversey’s proxy statement. Shareholders may only present a matter for consideration at the
2023 annual general meeting, if held, if certain procedures are followed. Any shareholders who intended to
present an item of business, including nominees for candidates for election as directors, at the 2023 annual
general meeting must have provided notice of such business to the Secretary of Diversey between January
4, 2023 and February 3, 2023. However, if the date of the 2023 annual general meeting is more than 30 days
before or after the anniversary date of the 2022 annual general meeting (which was held on May 4, 2022), in
the case of a proposal other than the nomination of a director, the Board shall determine a date within a
reasonable period prior to the Company’s annual general meeting by which the date a shareholder proposal
or nomination must be delivered and publicize such date in a press release or filing with the SEC. The
publication of this date will occur at least 10 days prior to the shareholder proposal or nomination deadline
established by the Board. In the case of the nomination of a director, in the event less than 130 days’ notice
or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to the shareholders, notice by the
shareholders to be timely must be so received no later than the close of business on the tenth day following
the earlier of the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure
was made. The notice must comply with all requirements of Diversey’s amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association.
Proponents must submit notices of proposals and nominations in writing to the Secretary of Diversey
Holdings, Ltd., at Secretary, Diversey Holdings, Ltd., 1300 Altura Road, Suite 125, Fort Mill, South Carolina
29708.
In addition, to comply with the universal proxy rules, Diversey shareholders who intend to solicit
proxies in support of director nominees at the 2023 annual general meeting, if held, other than the Company’s
nominees, must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary at the address set forth above,
that sets forth the information required by SEC Rule 14a-19, no later than March 5, 2023.

As permitted under the Exchange Act, in those instances where we are mailing a printed copy of this
proxy statement, only one copy of this proxy statement is being delivered to shareholders that reside at the
same address and share the same last name, unless such shareholders have notified the Company of their
desire to receive multiple copies of this proxy statement. This practice, known as “householding,” is
designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save significant printing and postage costs as well as natural
resources.
We will promptly deliver, upon oral or written request, a separate copy of this proxy statement to any
shareholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Requests for additional copies
should be directed to https://ir.diversey.com or by mail to our Secretary at Diversey Holdings, Ltd., 1300

Diversey files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the
SEC. These SEC filings are available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and at
www.sec.gov. In addition, shareholders may obtain free copies of the documents filed with the SEC by the
Company in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website at https://ir.diversey.com. The

Because the Merger is a “going-private” transaction, the Company, the Parent Entities and the Bain
Shareholder and certain of its affiliates have filed with the SEC a Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3
with respect to the proposed Merger. The Schedule 13E-3, including any amendments and exhibits filed or
incorporated by reference as a part of it, is available for inspection as set forth above. The Schedule 13E-3
will be amended to report promptly any material changes in the information set forth in the most recent
Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC. The Company will amend the Schedule 13E-3 to incorporate by reference
any additional documents that it may file with the SEC under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act after the date of this proxy statement and prior to the date of the Special Meeting to the extent required
to fulfill the Company’s obligations under the Exchange Act.
The directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees of the
Company may be deemed “participants” in the solicitation of proxies from Diversey shareholders in favor of
the proposed Merger. You can find information about the Company’s executive officers and directors in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2023 and the Company’s Annual Report on

C-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
AGREEMENT
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and the Stockholder hereby agree
as follows:
1. Agreement to Vote. Prior to the Termination Date (as defined herein), the Stockholder irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that it shall, at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company (whether annual or
extraordinary and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting), however called, or in connection with
any written consent of shareholders of the Company, in each case with respect to the matters described in
clause (b) below, (a) when such meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the Covered
Shares to be counted as present thereat for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and respond to each
request by the Company for written consent, if any and (b) vote (or consent), or cause to be voted at such
meeting (or validly execute and return and cause such consent to be granted with respect to), all Covered
Shares (i) in favor of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger and any other
matters necessary for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in the Merger
Agreement and (ii) against (A) any Acquisition Proposal, (B) any proposal for any recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, amalgamation, merger, sale of assets or other similar business
combination between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any other Person (other than the Merger)
and (C) any other action that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
materially adversely affect the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
this Agreement or any transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach in any material
respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under the Merger Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this
Section 1, the Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote the Covered Shares in its sole discretion
and without any other limitation on those matters other than those set forth in this Section 1 that are at any
time or from time to time presented for consideration to the Company Shareholders, and the Stockholder shall
not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any other matter presented to
the Company Shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Stockholder to vote in favor of, or otherwise act by written consent with respect to, any amendment to the
Merger Agreement that decreases the amount or changes the form of the merger consideration payable to the
Company Shareholders.
2. No Inconsistent Agreements. The Stockholder hereby represents, covenants and agrees that, except
as contemplated by this Agreement, and for the Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2021, by
and among the Company and the other parties thereto (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), the Stockholder
(a) has not entered into, and shall not enter into at any time prior to the Termination Date, any voting
agreement or voting trust with respect to any Covered Shares and (b) has not granted, and shall not grant at
any time prior to the Termination Date, a proxy or power of attorney with respect to any Covered Shares, in
either case, which is inconsistent with the Stockholder’s obligations pursuant to this Agreement. The
Stockholder and the Company hereby agree to terminate the Investor Rights Agreement effective
immediately prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreement without any
continuing liability on behalf of any party thereto, and, for the avoidance of doubt, each of the Stockholder
and the Company hereby waive the application of Section 3.4.3 of the Investor Rights Agreement to the
transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreement and the Merger Agreement.
3. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate without further action by any of the parties
hereto and shall have no further force or effect as of the earlier of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the termination
of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and (c) the election of the Stockholder in its sole
discretion to terminate this Agreement promptly following any amendment of any term or provision of the
original unamended Merger Agreement dated as of the date hereof that reduces or changes the form of
consideration payable to the Stockholder relative to the other stockholders of the Company pursuant to the
Merger (such earlier date being referred to herein as the “Termination Date”); provided, that the provisions
set forth in Sections 9 and 12 - 27 shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, further, that
termination of this Agreement shall not prevent any party hereto from seeking any remedies (at law or in
equity) against any other party for that party’s breach of any of the terms of this Agreement prior to the date
of termination.

performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder, the performance by the Stockholder of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated

authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is necessary on the part of the
Stockholder for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder or the
consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder nor the consummation by the
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby nor compliance by the Stockholder with any of the
provisions hereof shall (A) conflict with or violate, any provision of the Organizational Documents of
the Stockholder, (B) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on such
property or asset of the Stockholder pursuant to, any Contract to which the Stockholder is a party or by

any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Stockholder or any of the
Stockholder’s properties or assets, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C), for breaches, violations or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of the Stockholder
to perform its obligations hereunder.
(d) As of the date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding pending against the Stockholder or, to the
knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the Stockholder that restricts or prohibits (or, if
successful, would restrict or prohibit) the exercise by Parent of its rights under this Agreement or the
performance by the Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement.
(e) Except as provided in the Merger Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter, no broker,
finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder’s or other fee or commission for which

therein (including by operation of law), (iii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any
Covered Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Covered Shares

C-4 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Any Transfer in violation of this provision shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5
shall not prohibit a Transfer of the Covered Shares (including any new Covered Shares as described in
the immediately succeeding paragraph) by the Stockholder (x) to any beneficial owner, shareholder,
member or partner of the Stockholder or (y) to any Affiliate of the Stockholder, so long as, in the case of

Agreement, and the number of Company Shares held by the Stockholder set forth on Schedule A hereto
will be deemed amended accordingly and such Company Shares or voting securities shall automatically
become subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Stockholder shall promptly notify Parent and the
Company of any such event.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the Stockholder and its
Representatives shall be entitled to participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person making
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, including entering into a voting
agreement (to the extent permitted in clause (ii) below) in support thereof, but only in the event that the
Company and its Representatives are permitted to engage in discussions or negotiations in response to
such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.3 of the Merger Agreement and
(ii) the Stockholder shall be entitled to enter into any such voting agreement with any Person making a
Superior Proposal simultaneously with the execution and delivery of a definitive Alternative Acquisition
Agreement by the Company entered into as and to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement
(including Section 8.1(h) thereof). Nothing in this Section 5 shall prohibit the Stockholder or any of its
Representatives from informing any Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.

Business Days following the date of this Agreement, file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ
all necessary filings required by the HSR Act in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, which shall
request early termination of the HSR Act waiting period (if available) and (b) the Company and the
Stockholder shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, supply to Parent any information that may be
reasonably required (x) to prepare such filings required by the HSR Act and such filings, forms and
submissions with each Governmental Authority as set forth on Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter or (y) to respond to information requests by the FTC, the DOJ or the Governmental Authorities of any
other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made.

concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a
Rule 13e-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13e-3 (such transaction statement, including any amendment
or supplement thereto, the “Schedule 13e-3”) relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. The Stockholder will provide information reasonably requested by the Company or Parent in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13e-3. To the knowledge of the
Stockholder, the information supplied by the Stockholder for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13e-3 or any Other Required Company Filings will not, at the time that such
information is provided, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading. The Company will not file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC without first providing the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and the Company will give good faith consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Stockholder and its counsel. The Company and
C-5

Parent shall (i) provide the Stockholder and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of the
Schedule 13e-3 prior to filing the Schedule 13e-3 with the SEC and (ii) consider in good faith all comments
thereto reasonably proposed by the Stockholder, its outside counsel and its other Representatives.
8. Stockholder Capacity. This Agreement is being entered into by the Stockholder solely in its capacity
as a beneficial owner of the Company, and nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or affect the ability
of any Affiliate or designee of the Stockholder who is a director or officer of the Company to take any action
in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and exercising his or her fiduciary duties and
responsibilities in such capacity. No action taken (or omitted to be taken) in any such capacity as a director
or officer shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.
9. Waiver of Appraisal Rights. The Stockholder agrees not to assert, exercise or perfect, directly or
indirectly, and irrevocably and unconditionally hereby waives any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent
from the Merger that the Stockholder may have under applicable Law, including under Section 238 of the
CICA.
10. Disclosure. The Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in
any announcement or disclosure required by the SEC or other applicable Law and in the Proxy Statement the
Stockholder’s identity and ownership of the Covered Shares and the nature of the Stockholder’s obligations
under this Agreement; provided that, Parent shall provide the Stockholder and its counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon.
11. Further Assurances. From time to time, at the request of Parent and without further consideration,
the Stockholder shall take such further action as may reasonably be necessary or desirable to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
12. Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
Stockholder contained herein shall not survive the Termination Date.
13. Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in
any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically
designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each party and otherwise as expressly set forth
herein; provided that any such amendment by the Company shall be approved by the Special Committee.
14. Waiver. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by such party; provided that any such waiver given by the
Company shall be at the direction of and approved by the Special Committee.
15. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder must be in writing and will be deemed to

17. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement.
18. Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, the Company
or the Stockholder in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statute of
limitations, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the Cayman Islands: the Merger,
the vesting of the rights, property, choses in action, business, undertaking, goodwill, benefits, immunities
and privileges, contracts, obligations, claims, debts and liabilities of Merger Sub in the Company, the
cancellation of the Company shares, the rights provided in Section 238 of the CICA, the fiduciary or other
duties of the Company Board and the boards of directors of the General Partner (as general partner of Parent)
and Merger Sub and the internal corporate affairs of the Company and Merger Sub.
19. Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons
and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts (as defined below)) in any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or
any of its properties or assets, and nothing in this Section 19 will affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event
that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; (c)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e)
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the
Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead
or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, the
Company and the Stockholder agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law.
20. Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations
hereunder, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written approval of the other party; provided,
however, that Parent may assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided, that any such consent by the Company shall be
approved by the Special Committee; provided, that no assignment shall limit the assignor’s obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any party will
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment of this Agreement without
the consent required by this Section 20 is null and void.
21. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the parties will be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; and (B) the rights and limitations of
specific
C-8 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
enforcement under this Section 21 are an integral part of the Merger and without that right, no party would
have entered into this Agreement.
22. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes
or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable Law, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and
the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to
effect the intent of the parties. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
23. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE)
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 23.
24. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.
25. Facsimile or .pdf Signature. Any counterpart to this Agreement, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf,
.tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the
same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party may
raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.
26. No Presumption Against Drafting Party. The parties agree that they have been represented by legal
counsel during the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and therefore waive the application
of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
27. No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or
any of its Affiliates any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any
Covered Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefit of and relating to the Covered Shares shall
remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder, and Parent shall have no authority to manage, direct,
superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or
exercise any power or authority with respect to the Stockholder in the voting of any Covered Shares except
as specifically provided herein and in the Merger Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted
as creating or forming a “group” with any other Person for the purposes of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the Exchange
Act or for any other similar provision of applicable Law.
28. Acknowledgment. The Stockholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that, in connection with the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective
C-9 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, each Covered Share will be
automatically cancelled and exchanged into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $7.84, without
interest thereon (an amount that is lower than the Public Shareholder Per Share Price), in accordance with the
Merger Agreement.

with respect to Topco and its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective businesses (collectively,
“Topco Information”), (C) except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this

upon by Investor or any of its Affiliates or Representatives as having been authorized by Topco,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives (or any other Person),
(E) Topco will not have any responsibility, liability or obligation with respect to any
representations, warranties or agreements made by any other Person under or in connection with

Contribution and (G) without limiting Topco’s obligations under its governing documents, Topco
shall not have any liability or obligation (including, without limitation, for or with respect to any

disbursements incurred by Investor or any other Person), whether in contract, tort or otherwise, to
Investor, or to any Person claiming through Investor, in respect of the Investor Topco
Contribution.

Subscribed Topco Units with a view to or for the resale, distribution, subdivision or fractionalization
thereof and Investor does not have any plans to enter into any contract, undertaking, agreement or
arrangement for any such purpose. Investor understands and agrees that Topco shall not have any
obligation to recognize the ownership, beneficial or otherwise, of the Subscribed Topco Units by any

answers from, representatives of Topco concerning the merits and risks of investing in the Subscribed
Topco Units, and in making the decision to invest in Topco, Investor has relied solely upon

warranties expressly set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement. No representations or warranties, oral or
otherwise, have been made to Investor or any party acting on Investor’s behalf that are inconsistent
with the written materials which have been supplied to Investor by Topco. Investor has consulted, to
the extent deemed appropriate by Investor, with Investor’s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal
and related matters concerning an investment in the issued Subscribed Topco Units and on that basis
understands the financial, tax, legal and related consequences of an investment in the issued

(iii) Topco, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Section 8, in Article III of the Merger
Agreement, and in Section 9(g) of the Tax Indemnity Agreement, it is not acting (including, as

Subscribed Topco Units or any interest therein), (b) sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of
any Maximum Company Rollover Shares, any interests therein, or enter into any other agreement to do the
foregoing (except any agreement Topco reasonably requests that Investor execute in connection herewith)

voting trust or enter into any other voting agreement with respect to the Maximum Company Rollover
Shares.
11. Preferred Increase Option.
(a) In connection with financing the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Parent
intends to obtain common equity financing from third parties through a customary equity co-investment
(the “Co-Investment”). To the extent the amount of the Co-Investment as of the Closing, as determined
by Topco (acting reasonably), is reasonably expected to be less than $450,000,000 (the “Funding
Target”), then Topco, at its election, and in its sole discretion, shall have the right (the “Preferred
Increase Option”), upon written notice (the “Preferred Option Notice”) to Investor at least five Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, to increase the number of Company Shares that must be contributed by
Investor in the Preferred Exchange, subject to the following:
(i) Any increase in the number of Company Shares that must be contributed by Investor in the
Preferred Exchange shall be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of Topco
Preferred Units to be issued by Topco to Investor in the Preferred Exchange (to be issued to
Investor upon the same terms and conditions otherwise set forth herein; provided, however, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Additional Topco Preferred Units shall be issued at a price per Topco
Preferred Unit of $1,000 per unit).
(ii) For purposes of determining the number of additional Company Shares that Topco can
elect to have Investor contribute in the Preferred Exchange pursuant to the Preferred Increase
Option, Topco may only elect to cause Investor to receive from the Preferred Increase Option up to
a number of additional Topco Preferred Units having an Aggregate Initial Stated Value that is equal
to the difference between the Funding Target and the amount of the Co-Investment reasonably
expected to be raised as of the Closing, as determined by Topco (acting reasonably) (the
“Additional Topco Preferred Units”); provided that, in no event shall the Additional Topco
Preferred Units exceed 100,000 (or $100,000,000 in Aggregate Initial Stated Value) (the “Preferred
Increase Option Max”).
D-10 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(iii) The Preferred Option Notice shall identify (A) the additional number of Company Shares
to be contributed by the Investor in the Preferred Exchange, and (B) the number of Additional
Topco Preferred Units to be received by Investor in the Preferred Exchange.
(b) In the event that Topco exercises the Preferred Increase Option, Schedule II of this Agreement
shall automatically be amended (without any further action by Investor) to give effect to Topco’s
exercise of the Preferred Increase Option, including by updating (a) the column therein titled Subscribed
Topco Preferred Units to be the sum of (i) 437,750 plus (ii) the number of Additional Topco Preferred
Units set forth in the Preferred Option Notice, subject to the Preferred Increase Option Max (as updated
subject to the terms herein, the “Updated Subscribed Topco Preferred Units”); and (b) the column
therein titled “Company Preferred Rollover Shares” to be the sum of (i) the number of Company
Preferred Rollover Shares set forth on Schedule II as of the date of this Agreement, plus (ii) a number of
Company Shares equal to (A) the number of Additional Topco Preferred Units set forth in the Preferred
Option Notice, multiplied by $1,000.00, divided by (B) the Bain Per Share Price.
(c) For the avoidance of doubt, if Topco exercises the Preferred Increase Option, then all references
in this Agreement (unless the context otherwise requires) to the “Company Preferred Rollover Shares,”
“Company Rollover Shares,” “Subscribed Topco Preferred Units,” and “Subscribed Topco Units” shall
be deemed to reflect the number of Company Preferred Rollover Shares and Subscribed Topco Preferred
Units contemplated by Section 11(b).
12. Intentionally Omitted.
13. No Survival or Representations and Warranties; Survival of Covenants. Each representation and
warranty contained in this Agreement shall expire as of, and shall not survive, the consummation of the
Exchange and none of Investor or Topco, or any of their respective affiliates, representatives, stockholders,
partners or members shall have any liability whatsoever (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory
of law) with respect to any such representation or warranty following the Exchange, except to the extent
arising from Fraud. All covenants of each of the parties to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of
the Exchange and the consummation of the Closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
14. Merger Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that neither party nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or affiliates will have any liability or obligation to the
other party solely in such capacity resulting from or arising out of any termination of the Merger Agreement

publicly filed document relating to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement)
of (i) Investor’s identity, (ii) Investor’s beneficial ownership of the Company Rollover Shares (including the
number of Company Rollover Shares beneficially owned by Investor), and (iii) the nature of Investor’s
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement, and any other information that
Topco, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company reasonably determines to be required in any publicly filed
document in connection with the Merger or otherwise with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (provided that Topco will provide, or cause to be provided, to Investor a draft of any
document containing such disclosure a reasonable time prior to the publication, disclosure or filing thereof
and will consider in good faith any comments provided by Investor or its counsel), and (b) agrees to notify
Topco, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company of any required corrections with respect to any written
information supplied by Investor specifically for use in any such disclosure document as promptly as
practicable following Investor’s knowledge of the necessity of any such required correction. During the term
of this Agreement, Investor agrees that it will consult with Topco before issuing any press releases or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, except as may
be required in connection with the Merger in any Form 4, Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G (including any
amendments to the foregoing forms and schedules) or other disclosure required by the SEC or other
Governmental Authority to be made by Investor in connection with the Merger, provided that to the extent
reasonably possible, Investor shall deliver to Topco a copy of each such Form 4, Schedule 13D, Schedule
13G (including any amendments to the foregoing forms and schedules) or other disclosure so required prior
to filing the same.

16. Further Assurances; Other Agreements.
(a) Investor hereby acknowledges and agrees that, in exchange for the contribution of the
Company Rollover Shares, Investor is entitled to receive the Subscribed Topco Units, subject to the
terms and conditions described herein. The issuance of the Subscribed Topco Units to Investor in
accordance with this Agreement will completely discharge any obligations of Topco and its Affiliates to
pay the Merger Consideration otherwise owed with respect to the Company Rollover Shares, other than
obligations under the Partnership Agreement.
(b) Investor hereby covenants that, from time to time after the delivery of this Agreement, upon
reasonable request from Topco, Investor will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or will cause to be
done, executed, acknowledged and delivered such further acts, conveyances, transfers, assignments,
powers of attorney and assurances reasonably necessary to effect Topco’s receipt of Company Rollover
Shares in accordance with Section 1 hereof. Topco hereby covenants that, from time to time after the
delivery of this Agreement, upon reasonable request from Investor, Topco will do, execute, acknowledge
and deliver, or will cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered such further acts,
conveyances, transfers, assignments, powers of attorney and assurances reasonably necessary to
convey, transfer to and vest in Investor, and to put Investor in possession of, any of Subscribed Topco
Units in accordance with Section 1 hereof.
17. Issuing Entity. At the joint election of Topco and Investor, the Preferred Exchange may be structured
as a direct contribution of Company Preferred Rollover Shares to a Subsidiary of Topco (including a
Subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (any such subsidiary,
“Issuing Entity”) in exchange for equity interests in such Subsidiary and Topco may assign its obligation to
issue the Subscribed Topco Preferred Units to such Issuing Entity. In such case, for purposes of Section 18
hereof, the terms “Preferred Exchange” shall refer to such exchange with an Issuing Entity. In the event that
an Issuing Entity is used pursuant to the preceding sentences of this Agreement as a result of the joint
election by Topco and the Investor and such assignment is made, (i) if the Issuing Entity is (or will elect to
be) classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the Company Preferred Rollover
Shares are exchanged for stock of such Issuing Entity, (A) provisions contained in the Preferred Equity Term
Sheet under the caption “Tax Matters” shall not be applicable and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
include tax covenants applicable to an investment in preferred stock in a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine the tax treatment of the Preferred
Units (including treatment under sections 305 and 351(g) of the Code), and (B) the Preferred Exchange shall
be structured as a transaction intended to qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code and
(ii) Topco and Investor shall promptly amend and restate this Agreement (including the Schedules and
Preferred Equity Term Sheet, if applicable) to reflect such assignment, including if applicable, (A) the
changes to the Preferred Equity Term Sheet described in clause (i) above, (B) the designation of the assignee
as the Issuing Entity, and (C) any other changes, including changes in the type of security to be issued
(including any applicable terms) and document governing such security as may be appropriate or necessary
based on the type of entity that the assignee is; provided, that in the case of this clause (C) (but subject to
clause (A)), for the avoidance of doubt, other than to reflect the change in issuer type or as a result of such
change (including as a result of the issuer being classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), the economics, rights and obligations set forth in the Preferred Equity Term Sheet shall not be
changed without the prior written approval of Investor (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed). Investor and Topco agree to cooperate to effect any amendment and restatement of this Agreement
(and the Schedules and Preferred Equity Term Sheet, as applicable) to give effect to any assignment effected
by Topco pursuant to this Section 17, if the joint election is made. If, at the sole election of Issuer, a new
entity treated as a corporation (“New Corp”) for U.S. federal income taxes is interposed between Topco, on
the one hand, and Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., on the other hand, then the contribution of any direct or
indirect subsidiaries of Topco (including Olympus Water UK Holding Ltd. and Olympus Water US Holding
Corp.) to New Corp shall be structured to be treated as an exchange that is intended to be governed by
Section 351(a) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the determination as to whether to interpose such New Corp shall be made by Topco in its sole and absolute
discretion.

U.S. federal income tax purposes in exchange for interests in such entity, provided that, in each
case, in the event that such preferred units are redeemed or repurchased within two (2) years after
the issuance of such units, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine the tax treatment
of the Preferred Exchange;
(iii) (x) the Preferred Exchange and the Common Exchange be governed by (x) Section 351(a) of
the Code, if such exchange is structured as a direct contribution of Company Preferred Rollover
Shares and Company Common Rollover Shares to an Issuing Entity that is classified as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in exchange for stock of such Entity and (y) to the

the Code (or any similar or corresponding provision of state or local Law with respect to state or local
Law) or other binding settlement on audit, unless otherwise required by a change in law. Each party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other parties in writing if such party
receives written notice from a Taxing Authority to the effect that one or more of the transactions
referenced in the Intended Tax Treatment may not qualify for its respective part of the Intended Tax
Treatment.
(c) The Investor shall cooperate with Topco by providing information requested by Topco
(including information relating to direct or indirect investors of Investor) in determining the tax
treatment of a transfer of interests in Subsidiaries of Topco to a corporation, including a corporation
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States.

E-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, including that consideration paid or received
pursuant to the Rollover Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Definitions. As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:
“Contested Dutch Taxes” mean, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof)
commencing on or after January 1, 2017, all Dutch corporate Income Taxes imposed on the Company and its
Subsidiaries (excluding Parent and its Affiliates (as determined as of the time immediately before Closing),
other than any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are imposed on Parent and its Affiliates), (a) in
connection with, arising out of, or resulting from any Dutch Tax Action, and (b) without duplication of clause
(a), any additional Dutch corporate Income Taxes payable with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
beginning on or after January 1, 2019, if such Dutch Income Tax would not have otherwise been payable but
for (x) any legal requirement or any agreement with a Taxing Authority to report an item or issue with respect
to such period consistently with the resolution of such Dutch Tax Action or (y) an item or issue otherwise
being reported consistently with the resolution of such Dutch Tax Action, or the positions taken by the
Dutch Taxing Authority in such Dutch Tax Action in the event the Parties jointly agree to take such position
under Section 3, if such position is taken as a result of dispute resolution procedures contained in this
Agreement, or if the Company and its Subsidiaries unilaterally take such position on any Bain Dutch
Corporate Tax Return (as compared to the amount of Dutch corporate Income Taxes that would have been
payable had the Company and its Subsidiaries prevailed on each item and issue in such Dutch Tax Action
and reported consistently therewith in each applicable Tax year). For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) Contested Dutch Taxes shall be determined without regard to
any loss, credit, or tax attribute of Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) for any
taxable period, or any loss, credit, or other tax attribute of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising in taxable
periods (or portion thereof) commencing after the Closing Date (a “Buyer Tax Asset”); provided, that if a
Buyer Tax Asset is used, or is permitted by applicable law to be used, to reduce any Contested Dutch Taxes,
then the relevant Due Date defined in Section 5 shall be postponed until the earliest time or times that the
relevant Buyer Tax Asset could otherwise have been used to reduce a cash Tax payment of a Parent
Indemnitee (determined assuming that Buyer Tax Asset was not used to reduce a Contested Dutch Tax), and
(ii) any Contested Dutch Taxes shall take into account any available loss, credit, or other tax attribute of the
Company and its Subsidiaries arising in any Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the extent that such loss, credit, or
other tax attribute results in an actual reduction of Contested Dutch Taxes. By way of example only, if an
interest deduction with respect to an obligation for the Tax year 2017 is disallowed in connection with a final
resolution of a Dutch Tax Action, the Contested Dutch Taxes shall include, in addition to any Taxes arising
out of such disallowance, any additional Taxes owed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for each Pre-
Closing Tax Period after 2017 (including portions thereof) as a result of (x) a legal requirement or any
agreement with a Taxing Authority to report its income for such taxable period consistently with the
resolution of such Dutch Tax Action or (y) such interest deduction is otherwise being reported consistently
with the resolution of such Dutch Tax Action (as compared to the amount of Income Taxes the Company or
its Subsidiaries would have paid had it claimed interest deductions on such obligation in respect of each
such Tax year that it would have been entitled to deduct had it prevailed in the dispute on the interest
deduction for the Tax year 2017 (irrespective of whether such Taxes are owed with respect to such later year
as a result of filing a Tax return, an audit, or otherwise, and irrespective of whether there is an audit or other
proceeding with respect to such later years). For the avoidance of doubt, Contested Tax Dutch Taxes shall
only include actual cash Tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and not a reduction of Tax assets
or Tax attributes that do not result in a cash Tax liability; provided that for the avoidance of doubt Contested
Dutch Taxes shall include any cash Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period commencing on or after January 1,
2017, payable as a result of a reduction of such Tax assets or Tax attributes.
“Dutch Tax Action” means (i) any Dutch Tax audit for Dutch corporate Income Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the tax years 2017 and 2018 (including that certain currently ongoing Dutch audit for such
Taxes), (ii) any other Dutch Tax audit for Dutch corporate Income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period beginning after tax year 2018, and (iii) any other audits, investigations,
proceedings (whether judicial or administrative), claims, demands, actions, suits, inquiries assessments or
examinations by any Taxing Authority with respect to, Dutch corporate Income Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (or portions thereof) beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
E-2

whole or in part) to overall net income, profits, net worth, capital gains, gross receipts, gross income and
similar Taxes, including all interest, penalties, and additions to Tax or additional amount imposed with respect
thereto. Income Taxes shall also include any franchise Tax imposed in lieu of the foregoing.
“Liquidity Event” means a transaction or series of related transactions occurring after the Closing which
results in a direct or indirect disposition by the Bain Shareholder of all or some of its Subscribed Topco
Common Units (including via sale, exchange, redemption, or otherwise).

costs, other than the costs of Parent participating in the Dutch Tax Action as described in Section 4(b)),

including the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period (determined in accordance with Section 2(b) of this
Agreement).

environmental, and real or personal property taxes or other taxes, fees, assessments or charges, together with
all interest, penalties and additions to tax or additional amounts imposed with respect thereto and (b) any

operation of Law.
“Tax Return” means any return, estimate, declaration, claim for refund, information return and statement,
and any other document, form or report filed or required to be filed (or provided to a payee), with respect to
Taxes (including amendments thereof, any schedules or attachments thereto, or declaration of estimated Tax).

the Contested Dutch Taxes.
2. Indemnification.

Topco and each of       its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including Parent, the Surviving Company and
each Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, and each of their respective Affiliates) and each of their
respective officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (each, a “Parent Indemnitee”) from and against any Contested Dutch Taxes and Losses
related thereto, and shall promptly pay such amounts to the applicable Parent Indemnitee by the Due
Date. The indemnity obligations of the Bain Shareholder under this Agreement shall be effective as of
the date hereof and shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include amounts that are paid by the Company
and its Subsidiaries after the date hereof in respect of amounts referenced in this Section 2(a); provided
that such obligations shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and, if the Closing does
not occur, then no amounts shall be due or payable hereunder.
(b) With respect to a particular Tax period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date (a
“Straddle Period”), (i) with respect to property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis,
the amount attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall equal
the Taxes for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the portion of the period that is prior to and ends on (and includes)
E-3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in such entire Straddle
Period and (ii) with respect to all other Taxes (including income Taxes, sales or use Taxes, employment
Taxes, and withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends
on the Closing Date shall be determined as if such Straddle Period were a Tax period that ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (i.e., using a “closing of the books” methodology).
(c) Limits on Indemnity.
(i) Cap. (A) The Contested Dutch Taxes and related Losses for which the Bain Shareholder is
liable pursuant to Sections 2(a) hereof shall be seventy-two percent (72%) of such amounts and (B)
the total amount of Contested Dutch Taxes and related Losses for which the Bain Shareholder is
liable pursuant to Sections 2(a) shall not exceed €200,000,000 Euro (the “Cap”).
(ii) Source of Recovery.
(A) Except to the extent provided in Section 2(c)(ii)(C), the Parent Indemnitees’ sole and
exclusive source of recovery from the Bain Shareholder for the indemnification obligations set
forth in Section 2(a) of this Agreement shall be (I) any and all cash proceeds from a direct or
indirect disposition of Subscribed Topco Common Units to which the Bain Shareholder is
entitled, including cash proceeds from a disposition of Subscribed Topco Common Units to a
Person other than Parent or its Affiliates, and (II) any and all cash distributions (including tax
distributions) with respect to Subscribed Topco Common Units to which the Bain Shareholder
is entitled, in each case, that would otherwise be paid after a relevant Due Date (as defined
below) (“Rollover Proceeds”).
(B) To the extent any amounts owed by the Bain Shareholder under Section 2(a) remain
unpaid, (I) Parent and its Affiliates and agents shall be entitled to withhold such amounts from
any Rollover Proceeds to which the Bain Shareholder would otherwise be entitled and such
amounts will be treated as having been paid or distributed to the Bain Shareholder for all
purposes, and (II) the Bain Shareholder shall direct any buyer of Subscribed Topco Units held
by the Bain Shareholder to wire such amounts (to the extent not in excess of the consideration
paid by such buyer for the Subscribed Topco Units) to Parent or another Person designated
by Parent.
(C) Without limiting the generality of Section 2(c)(ii)(B), to the extent that a Liquidity
Event occurs or a cash distribution described in Section 2(c)(ii)(A) would otherwise be paid
before all Dutch Tax Actions have been fully and completely resolved, withdrawn or settled
with any liability related thereto having been satisfied in full, the following provisions shall
apply to proceeds from such Liquidity Event or such cash distribution:
A. If the proceeds from such Liquidity Event consist solely of cash or with respect
to any such cash distribution, Parent shall be entitled to withhold (or cause to be
withheld) from Rollover Proceeds otherwise payable in cash to the Bain Shareholder and
hold in a mutually agreeable third-party escrow account, or, if the purchaser of
Subscribed Topco Units is not Parent or an Affiliate thereof, the Bain Shareholder shall
deposit in a mutually agreeable third-party escrow account designated by Parent, in each
case pursuant to the terms of a mutually agreeable escrow agreement the terms of which
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith, an amount equal to the lesser of (I) the Cap, less
any amounts already paid by the Bain Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, (II)
Parent’s good-faith estimate of the maximum amount for which the Bain Shareholder could
be liable under this Agreement at the time of such Liquidity Event or cash distribution, in
each case, as determined by Parent in good faith with the approval of the Bain
Shareholder (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned),
and (III) cash proceeds received by the Bain Shareholder for its Subscribed Topco
Common Units upon such Liquidity Event or an amount equal to such cash distribution
as applicable; provided that, in the Bain Shareholder’s sole discretion, the Bain
Shareholder may, in lieu of depositing such funds as may be required pursuant to this
Section 2(c)(ii)(C)(A), instead provide a customary guaranty of such obligations from a
creditworthy affiliated investment fund of the Bain Shareholder.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
B. If the proceeds from such Liquidity Event or distributions with respect to
Subscribed Topco Common Units to which the Bain Shareholder is entitled consist solely
of any property other than cash (including, without limitation, equity interests in any
other entity), such property shall be deemed to be replacement property for the
Subscribed Topco Common Units (“Replacement Property”), the term “Subscribed Topco
Common Units” shall be deemed to include such Replacement Property for all purposes of
this Agreement, and the terms of this Agreement shall apply to such Replacement
Property mutatis mutandis. For the avoidance of doubt, proceeds from a subsequent
disposition of, or distribution on, Replacement Property received by the Bain Shareholder
shall be Rollover Proceeds for purposes of this Agreement and shall be a source of
recovery for Parent Indemnitees
C. If the proceeds from such Liquidity Event or distributions with respect to
Subscribed Topco Common Units to which the Bain Shareholder is entitled consist of
cash and Replacement Property, (x) the Replacement Property shall be treated in the
manner set forth in Section 2(c)(ii)(C)(B) above and (y) to the extent that Parent
determines in good faith with the approval of the Bain Shareholder (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) that amounts for which the Bain
Shareholder could to be liable under this Agreement may exceed the value of the
Replacement Property, Section 2(c)(ii)(C)(A) shall apply to cash proceeds from such
Liquidity Event.
(D) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 2(c)(ii)(C), in no event shall any Parent
Indemnitee have the right to “claw back” any such Rollover Proceeds or otherwise seek
payment from the Bain Shareholder after such Rollover Proceeds have been paid to the Bain
Shareholder; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Due
Date for the payment of any portion of Contested Dutch Taxes is postponed as a result of the
second sentence of the definition of Contested Dutch Taxes, the provisions of Section 2(c)(ii)
(C) shall apply to any Rollover Proceeds received during such the period beginning on the
date a Parent Indemnitee makes a claim under Section 2(a) the payment of which is postponed
as a result of the second sentence of the definition of Contested Dutch Taxes, but solely to
the extent of any such postponed amounts.
(E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that the
Bain Shareholder directly or indirectly transfers the Subscribed Topco Common Units to an
Affiliate of the Bain Shareholder in a non-arm’s length transaction, for purposes of this
Agreement the term Bain Shareholder shall include both the Bain Shareholder as of the date
hereof and such Affiliate, provided that, for purposes of determining the party required to
provide the guaranty contemplated in the proviso set forth in Section 2(c)(ii)(C)(A)), the last
reference in such proviso to the Bain Shareholder shall be the Bain Shareholder as of the date
hereof.
(iii) Tax Insurance Policy.
(A) The applicable Parent Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x)
obtain the Tax Insurance Policy; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall be required to obtain any policy with a
premium in excess of $30,000,000; provided further, that if the premium under such Tax
Insurance Policy is in excess of $30,000,000, the binding of such policy shall also require the
written consent of the Bain Shareholder (such consent which may be granted or not in the
Bain Shareholder’s sole discretion), and (y) obtain recovery under the Tax Insurance Policy for
Losses pursuant to Section 2(a)(i) and in accordance with the terms of such policy.
(B) If Parent or an Affiliate thereof is able to obtain a Tax Insurance Policy, the Bain
Shareholder shall have no further indemnification obligations hereunder for any Losses to the
extent such Losses are covered by such policy (taking into account, for the avoidance of
doubt, any exclusions from, and limitations to, such policy).
E-5 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(C) Any costs incurred in obtaining the Tax Insurance Policy, including any premium
payments, shall be paid solely by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent or, after the Closing, the
Company up to an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 and any such costs in excess of
$30,000,000 shall be borne by the Bain Shareholder.
(D) If the Bain Shareholder pays in cash any Contested Dutch Taxes pursuant to this
Agreement and Parent or any of its Affiliates subsequently recovers any amounts of
Contested Dutch Taxes that were paid in cash by the Bain Shareholder pursuant to this
Agreement on the Tax Insurance Policy, such amounts shall be for the account of the Bain
Shareholder and shall be paid five (5) days after receipt thereof, net of any costs and expenses
(including Taxes) incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in obtaining such recovery.
(E) The Bain Shareholder shall have the right to participate (at its own cost and expense)
in the negotiation of any Tax Insurance Policy with the insurer, including that (i) the Parent
Indemnitee shall keep the Bain Shareholder reasonably informed regarding the progress of
obtaining the Tax Insurance Policy, (ii) the applicable Parent Indemnitee shall provide the Bain
Shareholder with a reasonable opportunity to comment on any applicable documents and
consider in good faith, and use commercially reasonable efforts to include, any reasonable
comments made by the Bain Shareholder with respect thereto, and (iii) a representative of the
Bain Shareholder shall be entitled to participate in any conferences or negotiations with the
insurer.
(iv) The Indemnitor shall not be liable under Section 2(a) hereunder for any amount to the
extent (A) such amount relates to a Tax arising in any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date (a “Post-Closing Tax Period”) , or (B) due to the unavailability of any Tax
asset or attribute (including basis) in any Post-Closing Tax Period. For avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2(c)(iv) is not intended to limit the payments of any
amounts due but postponed under the second sentence of the definition of Contest Dutch Taxes.
(v) No Parent Indemnitee shall, without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) (i) re-
file, modify, or amend any Dutch Corporate Tax Return (as defined below) for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion thereof) commencing on or after January 1, 2017, (ii) extend or waive the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any Dutch corporate Income Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof) commencing on or after
January 1, 2017, (iii) file any ruling or request with the Dutch Taxing Authority that relates to
Contested Dutch Taxes, (iv) enter into any voluntarily disclosure agreement with the Dutch Tax
Authorities regarding any Contested Dutch Taxes.
(vi) Any amounts payable hereunder shall be determined net of any Income Tax benefits
actually realized by any Parent Indemnitee with respect to any such Contested Dutch Taxes or
related Loss in the taxable year of the indemnity payment or any prior taxable year (determined on a
“with or without” basis).
(vii) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Recovery against the Rollover Proceeds pursuant to this
Section 2 constitutes Parent’s sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims for
which the Bain Shareholder is liable pursuant to Section 2(a). Parent agrees that, other than (A)
from Rollover Proceeds in respect of the Bain Shareholder’s indemnification obligations set forth in
Section 2(a) of this Agreement or (B) against the Bain Shareholder in respect of breaches of Section
7, under no circumstances will the Bain Shareholder or any of its Affiliates, or their respective
officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the “Bain Parties”) have any liability to any of the Parent
Indemnitees relating to or arising out of this Agreement. None of Parent or the other Parent
Indemnitees may avoid the limitations on liability set forth in this Section 2(c)(vii) by seeking
damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability. Furthermore,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing but subject to the last sentence of this Section 2(c)
(vii), no claim shall be brought or maintained by any Parent Indemnitee against any Bain Party, and
no recourse of any kind shall be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon
any alleged
E-6 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants
or obligations of the Bain Shareholder set forth in this Agreement, any certificate, instrument,
opinion or other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or the subject matter of this
Agreement, in each case other than claims permitted under, in compliance with, and subject to all of
the provisions and limitations of this Section 2. The Parties agree that the provisions in this
Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on remedies with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including this Section 2(c)(vii)), constitute
an integral part of the consideration given to the Bain Shareholder and were specifically bargained
for between sophisticated parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section
2(c)(vii) shall not be construed as limiting any rights and remedies of the Parent Indemnitees
against the Bain Shareholder (A) under any other Transaction Agreements (as defined below) or
any other agreement between or among the parties hereto, (B) for breaches of representations and
warranties under Section 7, or (C) in the event of actual fraud in respect of the representations and
warranties in this Agreement by any Bain Party.
(viii) Mitigation. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection
herewith.
3. Tax Returns.
(a) Parent shall be entitled to prepare or cause to be prepared all Dutch corporate Income Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods commencing on or after
January 1, 2017 that are filed after the Closing Date (“Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Returns”). All such
Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with past practice, unless otherwise
required by law (including the resolution of any Dutch Tax Action). With respect to any Parent Dutch
Corporate Tax Return , Parent shall provide the Shareholder Representative with drafts of such Parent
Dutch Corporate Tax Returns no later than twenty (20) days prior to the filing date thereof. The
Shareholder Representative shall have the right to review, approve (subject to the dispute resolution
mechanism contemplated herein), and provide comments on such Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Returns
during the ten (10)-day period following the receipt of such Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Returns. Parent
and the Shareholder Representative shall consult with each other and attempt in good faith to resolve
any issues arising as a result of any Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Returns and, if they are unable to do
so, the disputed items shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for
filing such Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Return) by a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm
chosen by both the Parent Indemnitees and the Shareholder Representative. Upon resolution of all such
items, the relevant Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Return shall be timely filed on that basis. The costs, fees
and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Parent, on the one hand, and the Bain
Shareholder, on the other hand. If any dispute with respect to a Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Return is
not resolved prior to the due date of such Parent Dutch Corporate Tax Return, such Parent Dutch
Corporate Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which Parent deems correct, without prejudice to the
other party’s rights and obligations under this Section 3(a).
(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to prepare or cause to be prepared all Dutch
corporate Income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that
are filed or due before the Closing Date (“Bain Dutch Corporate Tax Returns” and, together with Parent
Dutch Corporate Tax Returns, “Dutch Corporate Tax Returns”). All such Bain Dutch Corporate Tax
Returns shall be prepared consistent with past practice, unless otherwise required by law (including the
resolution of any Dutch Tax Action). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with drafts
of any Bain Dutch Corporate Tax Returns no later than twenty (20) days prior to the filing date thereof
and Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have the rights afforded to the Shareholder Representative in
Section 3(a) above.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
4. Defense of Claims.
(a) After the earlier of (i) obtaining knowledge of a claim or (ii) receiving written notice of any
Dutch Tax Action for which the Bain Shareholder is or may be liable under this Agreement, Parent shall
give Shareholder Representative reasonably prompt written notice (a “Claim Notice”) of any such claim,
describing in reasonable detail the claim, the Losses actually incurred to date, the amount of such claim
(if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof and including copies of all applicable documents
relating to such claim. Parent’s failure to provide a Claim Notice to the Shareholder Representative
pursuant to this Section 4(a) shall not relieve the Bain Shareholder of any liability that the Bain
Shareholder may have to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent the Bain
Shareholder is materially prejudiced by such delay.
(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have the right to control the defense, appeal, or
settlement of any Dutch Tax Action (including selection of counsel, determining whether to pursue or
forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings (whether judicial or administrative), hearings,
conferences, and mutual agreement procedures) including with respect to a Straddle Period; provided
that (i) Parent shall have the right to participate, at its own cost and expense (which costs and expenses,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be subject to the indemnification obligations set forth in Section
2(a)), in defending against any such Dutch Tax Action, (ii) the Shareholder Representative shall consult
Parent concerning the conduct of such Dutch Tax Action, (ii) the Shareholder Representative shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the progress of any such Dutch Tax Action, (iii) any counsel selected by
Shareholder Representative shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed) and, for the avoidance of doubt, both Kirkland & Ellis LLP and PwC shall be
deemed reasonably acceptable for purposes of this clause (iii), (iv) the Shareholder Representative shall
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment on any written materials prior to their
submission and accept any reasonable comments made by Parent with respect thereto, (v) a Company
representative shall be entitled to be present at all meetings with the relevant Tax authority and all other
proceedings, and (vii) the Shareholder Representative and its Affiliates shall not settle any Dutch Tax
Action without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall execute any powers of attorney
or other documents to allow for the Shareholder Representative to control any Tax Action that the
Shareholder Representative is entitled to control pursuant to this Section 4(b).
5. Due Date for Payment. The due date for payment under Section 2 (the “Due Date”) shall be the date
falling five (5) business days after service by Parent of a notice containing a written demand (which shall set
out reasonable particulars of the liability) in respect of relevant liability, or, where later and if applicable,
where a liability to make a payment of Tax which has not at the date of the notice become due and payable,
the date falling five (5) business days before the latest date (taking into account the conduct of the matter
giving rise to the claim) by which that Tax is due and payable to the relevant taxing authority, provided that
if in the course of any Dutch Tax Action the date on which the Tax is due and payable is postponed, the due
date for payment shall be five (5) business days before such date.
6. Tax Refunds. In the event that the Bain Shareholder pays any Contested Dutch Taxes pursuant to this
Agreement and Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates receives a refund of a Contested Dutch Tax,
the Bain Shareholder shall be entitled to the amount of such refunded Contested Dutch Tax that was paid by
the Bain shareholder pursuant to this Agreement (including interest paid thereon by any Taxing Authority),
provided that the portion of any such refund that is on account of the Bain Shareholder shall not exceed 72%
of the aggregate amount of any such refund that is received by the Company or its Subsidiaries (a “Seller Tax
Refund”). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, any Seller Tax Refund to the Bain Shareholder within five (5)
days of receipt thereof, net of (x) any Taxes of Parent or any of its Affiliates attributable to such refund, and
(y) any expenses incurred in obtaining such refunds. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain (or cause to be obtained) any Seller Tax Refund and will request a refund to be paid in cash where
available. Parent shall keep the Shareholder Representative reasonably informed as to the availability of any
Seller Tax Refund and the status of any claim regarding any Seller Tax Refund. If any amount paid to the Bain
Shareholder pursuant to this Section 6 is subsequently challenged successfully by any Taxing Authority, the
Bain Shareholder shall repay to Parent such amount (together with
E-8 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any interest and penalties assessed by such Taxing Authority in respect of such amount). Such repayment
obligation shall survive until the date that is ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the collection by the applicable Taxing Authority or other Person of the Tax
liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). Any rights of the Bain
Shareholder to the receipt of Seller Tax Refunds pursuant to this Section 6 shall expire on the date that is
three (3) years after the date on which the Bain Shareholder ceases to be liable for any Contested Dutch
Taxes or related Losses pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
7. Tax Receivable Agreement. No Tax Benefit Payment (as defined in the TRA) or other payments
(including any payment pursuant to Article IV of the TRA) has been made in respect of, or pursuant to, the
TRA, to the Shareholder Representative, to any Shareholder, for or on behalf of the Shareholders (as such
terms are defined in the TRA), or any other person at any time on or after January 1, 2023 (other than a
payment of approximately $1.7 million in January 2023), and no payments will be made pursuant to such
agreement after the date hereof.
8. Cooperation. Parent shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative, in connection with any Dutch Tax Action. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Shareholder Representative’s request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Dutch Corporate Tax Return or Dutch Tax
Action, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
9. Adjustment. The Parties hereto agree to treat any payment hereunder as an adjustment with respect to
the Common Exchange (as defined in the Rollover Agreement) for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by
Law.
10. Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated elsewhere in this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement, the Tax Receivable Termination Agreement, the Rollover Agreement, any clean team agreement
entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any other
Transaction Document (the “Transaction Agreements”), the obligations of the Bain Shareholder under this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days subsequent to the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including extensions) applicable to the assessment or collection of the Contested Dutch Taxes.

(b) The Parties agree that they have been represented by legal counsel during the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and therefore waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be
construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document.
(c) This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of
which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered by Electronic Delivery, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed
version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
(d) This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
(e) The headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and
will not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any
term or provision hereof. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used in this
Agreement is equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term, and words
denoting any gender include all genders. When used herein, (i) the words “hereof,” “herein” and
“herewith” and words of similar import will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; and (ii) the words
“include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed in each case to be followed by the words “without
limitation.”
E-11 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(f) In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable Law, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.
(g) Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that, as of the date hereof, the execution,
delivery, and performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
required by or on behalf of such Party, and this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Party, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. Each Party represents and
warrants to the other Party that, as of the date hereof, the execution, delivery and performance by such
Party of this Agreement requires no consents, waivers, filings, authorizations or approvals other than
such consents, waivers, filings, authorizations and approvals that have been obtained or made as of the
date hereof.
(h) Each Party shall, without additional consideration, execute and deliver such further instruments
and take such further actions as may be reasonably requested by another Party to make effective, and to
effectuate, the transactions contemplated by this Amendment.
(i) No provision of this Agreement may be amended unless such amendment is approved in writing
by Parent and the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Bain Shareholder). No provision of this
Agreement may be waived by (i) Parent, Merger Sub, Holdings UK, Topco or the Company (after the
Closing), unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Parent, or (ii) the Bain Shareholder, the
Shareholder Representative or the Company (prior to the Closing), unless such waiver is in writing and
signed by the Shareholder Representative. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives, including any permitted
assignee. This Agreement and any rights and obligations of an Indemnitor not be assigned by such
Indemnitor without Parent’s express prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed); any assignment without such written consent shall be null and void.
(j) In the event of any litigation or arbitration related to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall
be entitled to receive reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.
(k) This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the Parties hereto in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each of
the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process
(whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts (as defined below)) in any
such action; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and
assets in any such action to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or
controversy arises out of this Agreement; (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any such
action arising in connection with this Agreement shall be brought, tried and determined only in the
Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such
action in the Chosen Courts or that such action was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to
plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it shall not bring any such action relating to this Agreement
in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any action in
E-12

the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.
(l) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER; (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER;
(III) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS

into that certain Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of March 24, 2021 (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”);

The Special Committee of the Board of Directors 
Diversey Holdings, Ltd. 
1300 Altura Road, Suite 125 
Fort Mill, SC, 29708
Members of the Special Committee:
We understand that Diversey Holdings, Ltd. (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted
limited partnership (“Parent”) and Diamond Merger Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger and becoming a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, (a) each outstanding ordinary share, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Shares”), other than the Bain Shares, Excluded Company
Shares or Dissenting Shares (each, as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be automatically cancelled and
exchanged into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $8.40 (the “Public Shareholder Per Share
Price”) and (b) each outstanding Bain Share, other than the Rollover Shares, will be automatically cancelled
and exchanged into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $7.84. The terms and conditions of the
Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Special Committee of the board of directors of the Company (the “Special Committee”) has asked us
whether, in our opinion, the Public Shareholder Per Share Price to be received by holders of the Company
Shares in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders other than the holders of the Bain
Shares, Excluded Company Shares or Dissenting Shares.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company
that we deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished
to us by management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Special Committee (the
“Forecasts”);
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations
of the Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Forecasts
(including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving the Forecasts);
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Shares;
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with
those of certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the
Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that
we deemed relevant;
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated March 7, 2023, of the Merger
Agreement; and
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we
deemed appropriate.

G-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or
otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of
such information (and have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such
information), and have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With
respect to the Forecasts, we have assumed with your consent that they have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the
Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to the Forecasts or
the assumptions on which they are based.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that
the final executed Merger Agreement will not differ from the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us, that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that
each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger
Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or
modification thereof. We have further assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be
obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the
Company or the consummation of the Merger or reduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of the
Company Shares (other than the Bain Shares, Excluded Company Shares or Dissenting Shares) of the
Merger.
We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have
not made or assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the
Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the
solvency or fair value of the Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of the date hereof
and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as can be evaluated on the date
hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than
the fairness to the holders of the Company Shares (other than the holders of the Bain Shares, Excluded
Company Shares or Dissenting Shares), from a financial point of view, of the Public Shareholder Per Share
Price. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed
transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of Bain Shares or any
other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor the aggregate consideration
to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement nor any allocation among shareholders of the aggregate
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including among all holders of Company Shares,
nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Public
Shareholder Per Share Price or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and
our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including,
without limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, any offer to purchase, redeem or exchange, or consent
solicitation undertaken with respect to, outstanding debt securities of the Company, or any term or aspect of
any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in
connection with the Merger Agreement including the Rollover Agreement or the TRA Termination Agreement
(each as defined in the Merger Agreement). Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger
as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it
address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger. In arriving at our
opinion, we were not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to
the acquisition of any or all of the Company Shares or any business combination or other extraordinary
transaction involving the Company. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special
Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of the
Company Shares should vote or act in respect of the Merger. We are not expressing any opinion
G-2 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
as to the prices at which the Company Shares will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in
the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on
the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations when they
come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed the accuracy and
completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting
and tax matters.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with the Merger and have
received an initial fee for our services and will receive additional fees, a portion of which is payable upon
rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify us against
certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore
Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the
Company or its subsidiaries and we have not received any compensation from the Company or its
subsidiaries during such period, other than as described in the first sentence of this paragraph. During the
two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial
advisory and/or other services to Platinum Equity, LLC, an affiliate of Parent (“Platinum”), Bain Capital
Private Equity LP, an affiliate of the Company (“Bain”), and/or their respective affiliates and portfolio
companies and received fees for the rendering of these services. We may provide financial advisory or other
services to the Company, Parent, Platinum and Bain or any of their respective affiliates or portfolio
companies in the future, and in connection with any such services we may receive compensation.
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for our and their own
accounts and the accounts of customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity
sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In
connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and/or our or their
respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at
any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions
for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or
derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to the Company, the Parent, Platinum, Bain,
or potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or portfolio companies or persons
that are competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, the Parent, Platinum, Bain or any of their
respective affiliates or portfolio companies.
Our financial advisory services and this opinion are provided for the information and benefit of the
Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The
issuance of this opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.
This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to any
third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval, except the Company may
reproduce this opinion in full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and required to be mailed by the Company to its stockholders relating to the Merger.

to this Agreement, which written notice shall also request that such Person promptly return or destroy

electronic data room access (or other diligence access) of any such Person. Subject to the terms of

could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (or Inquiries,

the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will be required to enforce, and will not be permitted to
waive, terminate or modify, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits or
purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof) unless the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to
take such action (I) would prohibit the counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) in compliance with this Section 5.3 and (II) would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.3, from
the date of this Agreement until the date that is thirty (30) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement (the “Fiduciary Out Period”), the Company and the Company Board or the Special Committee
may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives, participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person or its Representatives that has made, renewed or
delivered to the Company an unsolicited, written bona fide Acquisition Proposal during the Fiduciary
Out Period, and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition Proposal or assist such Person (and its
Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal if requested by such Person, in
each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a material breach of Section
5.3(a) and that the Company Board or the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such actions
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s or the Special Committee’s, as
applicable, fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information or data that is provided to
any Person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub prior to
or substantially concurrently to the time it is provided to such Person.

qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation or the Special Committee Recommendation;
(B) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation or the Special Committee Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation or the
Special Committee Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following the written request of
Parent (provided, however, that Parent may make such request no more than twice plus one time
more each time an Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry or material modification thereto shall have
become publicly known); (D) publicly adopt, endorse, approve or recommend (or publicly propose
to adopt, endorse, approve or recommend) an Acquisition Proposal; or (E) make any
recommendation in support of, or, within ten (10) Business Days following its commencement, fail
to recommend against, a tender or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E), an “Adverse Recommendation Change”);
provided, however, that none of (1) a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company
Board or the Special Committee to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication), (2) the
determination by the Company Board or the Special Committee that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or the taking of any other action contemplated by Section 5.3(b) as
and to the extent permitted by Section 5.3(d)(ii); or (3) the delivery by the Company of any notice
contemplated by Section 5.3(d) or any negotiations during the Notice Period in respect thereto in
compliance with this Agreement will constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change or a violation
of this Section 5.3; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.
(d) Adverse Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Approval:
(i) the Company Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, may effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board or the Special
Committee, as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board or the
Special Committee shall not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change unless:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business
Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board or the Special Committee intends to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify the basis for such
Adverse Recommendation Change, including a reasonably detailed description of the facts
and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event;
(2) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, during such five (5)
Business Day period, the Company has negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in
good faith (to the extent that Parent requested to do so) to allow Parent to offer such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Commitment Letters in
such a manner that would obviate the need to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event; and
(3) following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board or the Special
Committee, as applicable (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Commitment Letters and any other information provided by Parent)
shall have determined that the failure of the Company Board or the Special Committee, as
applicable, to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
A-60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that each time material modifications to the
Intervening Event occur, the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time
period set forth in the preceding clause (2) and in this clause (3) shall recommence provided
that such time period shall instead be three (3) Business Days from the day of such
notification; or
(ii) if the Company has received an unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal,
then the Company Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, may (A) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; and/or (B) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h); and/or (C) cause the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal substantially
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company Board
or the Special Committee, as applicable, shall only be permitted to take the actions described in the
foregoing clauses (B) and (C) during the Fiduciary Out Period and shall not take any action
described in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) unless:
(1) the Company Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;
(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.3 with respect to such Superior Proposal; and
(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent five (5) Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board or the Special Committee,
as applicable (A) has received an Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) has
concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and
(C) has resolved to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, which notice will identify the Person or “group” of Persons making such
Superior Proposal and include the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant agreements
relating to such Superior Proposal; and during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent has requested to do
so) to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Commitment Letters in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(4) following such Notice Period, the Company Board or the Special Committee, as
applicable (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking
into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Commitment Letters and any other information provided by Parent) shall have determined
that the failure of the Company Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, to make such an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that each time material modifications to
the terms of an Acquisition Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal are made (it being
understood that any change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material
modification), the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set
forth in the preceding clause (3) shall recommence provided that such time period shall instead
be three (3) Business Days from the day of such notification.
(e) Notice. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent if any Inquiries, offers or proposals that
constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-
public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated

must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such Inquiries,
offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing, including to (i)
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) all terms
and conditions applicable to Parent and the Borrower set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Debt Commitment Letters (including definitive agreements related thereto and, to the extent required by
the Debt Commitment Letter, any “flex” terms contained in the Fee Letter), respectively, that are to be
satisfied by it to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including the payment of any
commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing, (ii) maintain
in full force and effect the Commitment Letters, negotiate and enter into definitive agreements (the

until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing) with respect thereto
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (other than modifications to
terms as are acceptable to Parent and which do not contain any Prohibited Modifications), (iii) comply

reason therefor and (B) use its reasonable best efforts, and cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts, to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, alternative debt financing (the “Alternative Financing”) in
amounts (after taking into consideration the amount of the Financing that is available) equal to or
greater than the Required Amount and which does not include any Prohibited Modifications; provided,
that if Parent or any of its Subsidiaries proceeds with Alternative Financing, it shall be subject to the
same obligations with respect to the Alternative Financing as set forth in this Section 6.5 with respect to

to representations in this Agreement made by Parent that speak as of the date hereof) shall be deemed

Agreements promptly upon such request. Upon receipt of commitments with respect to any Alternative
Financing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent shall promptly provide to the Company copies of

Agreements of which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge thereof, (ii) of the receipt by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of (1) any written notice or (2) other written communication, in each

portion of the Financing necessary to have funds in the Required Amount at Closing. Following the
written request of the Company, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence. Following the written request of the Company, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing, including any
Alternative Financing. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (1) any
portion of the Debt Financing structured as permanent financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor, (2) all conditions contained in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived (other
than (x) any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing, and (y) those conditions the failure of which to
be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement) and (3) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 6.5) are
available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, then Parent shall cause
the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used promptly in lieu of such affected portion of the
permanent financing.

amend, supplement, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Commitment Letters or any Definitive
Agreements without the Company’s prior written consent (which consent shall have been approved by
the Special Committee) if such replacement, supplement, modification, amendment or waiver (i) reduces
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount, when taken together with the Equity
Financing, less than the Required Amount, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions, or otherwise
adversely modifies or expands any of the conditions, to the receipt of Debt Financing, (iii) adversely
affects the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified or (iv) effects any other amendment, modification or waiver that would reasonably
be expected to delay the Closing beyond the date the Closing is required to occur under this Agreement
or prevent the Closing or impede the ability of Parent to consummate the Closing (the effects described
in clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the “Prohibited Modifications”); provided, however, that for the
avoidance of doubt, Parent may, without the written consent of the Company, (1) amend the Debt
Commitment Letters solely to add Debt Financing Sources that have not previously executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement and to grant to such Debt Financing Sources such
approval rights as are customarily granted to additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities, (2) amend the Definitive Agreements solely to give effect to any
“flex” terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (as in effect on the date hereof) and (3) amend

“Debt Commitment Letter” and “Debt Financing” shall include such debt financing and letters as
amended, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or substituted in compliance with this Section 6.5

Definitive Agreements prior to Closing. Parent shall not amend, alter or waive, or agree to amend, alter
or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of the Equity Commitment Letter without
the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall have been approved by the Special
Committee). Parent shall promptly (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) notify the
Company of (i) the expiration or termination (or attempted or purported termination, whether or not
valid) of the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) any refusal by Guarantor to provide the full financing
contemplated by

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary or Affiliate (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary or Affiliate as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person
(including any employee benefit plan)), regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time; and (iii) the Merger, as well as any actions
taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto, except that if, at any time prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such
notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally

the defense of such Legal Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified Person to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving
Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for
which indemnification is reasonably likely to be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person
complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected
by the Surviving Company (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person),
the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the Surviving Company.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O
Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including
with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the
D&O Insurance; provided, that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the
terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such
directors and officers than the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) request that the
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time). In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the
Surviving Company will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid
by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”).
If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the
Surviving Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’
liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the
Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) maintain such
“tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such
“tail” policy is in full force and effect in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving
Company or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company set forth in this Section 6.10.

bonus plans, arrangements or agreements) provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing; provided, that, in all circumstances, the base salary or wages, as applicable, of each
Continuing Employee shall, during the period commencing as of the Closing Date and concluding one
(1) year following the Effective Time, be at least equal to such Continuing Employee’s base salary or
wages, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing.
(b) New Plans. Following a good faith review of the Employee Plans in which Continuing
Employees participate immediately before the Effective Time (“Old Plans”), Parent shall determine in its
sole discretion whether to maintain any such plans following the Effective Time. In the event an Old
Plan is terminated or otherwise discontinued following such determination by Parent, Continuing
Employees who previously participated in such a plan shall be eligible to participate in any comparable
benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company (“New
Plans”). With respect to any New Plans in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate, but
other than with respect to benefit accruals and level of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan,
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to the same extent that such service was
recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it
would result in duplication of coverage or benefits or in benefits that are greater than what was
previously provided under a comparable Old Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the

foregoing, (i) for purposes of each New Plan in which a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
that provides life insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits, the Surviving
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same
extents such requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Old Plan, and (ii) the
Surviving Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of
the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.
(c) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment or engagement for services
for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee or other individual service provider of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in
any Person. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.11 to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Employee
Plan or any other employee benefit plans of the Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries.

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses
whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving

entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. For the sake of clarity, such Taxes
shall not include any Taxes or fees based in whole or in part upon income, profits or gain.
(b) Company Termination Fee.
(i) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or
Section 8.1(e); (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e) an
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry for an Acquisition Transaction has been publicly announced or
disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned or an Acquisition Proposal has otherwise
become known, disclosed or communicated to the Company Board or the Special Committee and
not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (C) within twelve (12) months following the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), either an
Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is
subsequently consummated, then the Company shall substantially concurrently with such
consummation pay the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all
references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references
to “50%”.
(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company must
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such termination pay, or cause
to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.
(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must
substantially concurrently with such termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company

designated in writing by Parent.
(c) Parent Termination Fee. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to (i) Section 8.1(g) or

such termination pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Company.
(d) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or
Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
(e) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the Merger and that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate
the Company and the Company Related Parties or Parent and the Parent Related Parties, as applicable,
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
A-87 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 8.3(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a
Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section
8.3(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(c) or
any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company shall pay to Parent or Parent shall pay to the Company,
as the case may be, (a) its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) in connection
with such Legal Proceeding and (b) with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate
equal to 2% plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such
payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion
thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law;
provided, that in no event shall such costs, expenses and interest set forth in the foregoing clauses (a)
and (b) exceed $4,000,000 in the aggregate.
(f) Sole Remedy.
(i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 or for any other reason, the
Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee (and any amounts to which the Company is
entitled under Section 8.3(e)) to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including the
Company’s right to enforce the Guarantee with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination
Fee from Guarantors), the Reimbursement Obligations and the Company’s right to specific
performance pursuant to Section 9.8 will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company and
the Company Related Parties against (A) Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources and each of
their respective Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub

against Parent and Merger Sub and subject to the limitations set forth herein (or Guarantors in
accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, the Guarantee and Equity Commitment
Letter)), none of the Parent Related Parties, the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing
Source Parties will have any further liability or obligation to the Company or the Company Related
Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith
(including the Commitment Letters and the Guarantee) or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Reimbursement Obligations, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a), Section
8.3(e), and Section 8.3(f) and Guarantors will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Guarantee, subject to the
limitations set forth therein), and neither the Company nor Company Related Party shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub, any other Parent
Related Party, any Debt Financing Sources or any of the Debt Financing Source Parties arising out
of, related to or otherwise in connection with this Agreement (or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the failure of the Closing to be consummated or the Commitment Letters and the
financings contemplated therein, including the Debt Financing and the financing of the Equity
Financing (and the abandonment or termination thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 8.3(f)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantors from liability (1) for any Willful
and Material Breach of this Agreement or (2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement
(except as further set forth in the immediately following proviso); provided that (x) under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates (including Guarantors) for breaches under this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity
Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to $125,000,000 plus the Reimbursement Obligations
and any obligations under Section 8.3(e) in the aggregate for all such breaches (taking into
account, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the
Reimbursement Obligations and/or any obligations under
A-88 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 8.3(e)) and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek to recover
any money damages in excess of such amount and (y) in the event Parent (or Guarantors) pays the
Parent Termination Fee (or an aggregate dollar amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee, whether
or not such amount is identified as the “Parent Termination Fee”) to the Company following a valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms when such Parent Termination Fee is
payable, and the Company accepts such fee or does not return it to Parent within two (2) Business
Days of the Company’s receipt thereof, the Company Related Parties shall have no further rights or
remedies whatsoever against any of the Parent Related Parties, including any claims for monetary
damages of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether or not arising as a result of or in connection
with any Willful and Material Breach and whether sounding, in contract, tort, at law or in equity, or
based on any other legal theory or argument. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1, other than the remedies described in this Section 8.3(f)(i), no Parent Related Party, Debt
Financing Sources or Debt Financing Source Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate
(or limited liability company or limited partnership) veil, by or through a claim against Guarantors or
any other Parent Related Party, the Debt Financing Sources or any Debt Financing Source Parties,
in each case to the Company or any Company Related Party, and the Company covenants and
agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its directors, officers and Subsidiaries and direct
its other Representatives, Affiliates and other Company Related Parties not to institute, a Legal
Proceeding to seek recourse for such further liability or obligation.
(ii) Except for any claims permitted under the Rollover Agreement against the parties thereto in
accordance with the terms thereof, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 under
circumstances in which Parent is entitled to the Company Termination Fee, Parent’s receipt of the
Company Termination Fee (and any amounts to which Parent is entitled under Section 8.3(e)) to the
extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and Parent’s right to specific performance pursuant to

contemplated hereby and thereby, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company
Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
