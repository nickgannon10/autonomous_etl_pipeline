Cargill Protein is a leading global player in the protein industry.
Holdings is majority-owned by Continental Grain Company (“CGC”), a privately-held, family-owned company focused on operating and value-

companies.
CGC has a long history as an owner, operator and investor in the poultry and protein industries. Wayne Farms has been majority-owned by
CGC since 1965. Outside of poultry, CGC has extensive experience in other sectors of the protein industry. This includes experience from long-term
ownership of Premium Standard Farms / Smithfield Foods (exited 2013), a pork production business with CGC’s operations as an important platform
that grew organically and via mergers and acquisitions into the United States’ largest swine operation. It also includes expertise from long-term
ownership of Five Rivers Ranch Cattle Feeding (exited 2008), a cattle feeding business with 11+ feed yards across the United States, formed in 2005
through the combination of CGC’s and Smithfield’s feed operations to become the largest United States feed lot.

Farms, Platinum Harvest, Ladybird, and Naked Truth brands. In 2018, Wayne Farms opened a Customer Innovation Center in Decatur, Alabama with
a fully-equipped culinary kitchen to collaborate and test new concepts or products with its customers. Wayne Farms consistently ranks in the top
quartile across industry operating key performance indicators measured by Agri Stats, an independent industry assessor. Wayne Farms’ operations
have delivered leading results through forming strategic partnerships with key vendors, customers and a continual focus on operational

substantial knowledge and experience in the U.S. poultry industry as well as long tenure at the business, with a strong succession plan in place for
key leadership across the organization. This experienced management team, supported by a leading global agribusiness company in CGC and

Stockholder that is a U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax

surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such stockholder. Backup withholding taxes may also apply to the cash payment made pursuant to the
Merger, unless such U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures under the backup withholding rules.
A Sanderson Farms Stockholder that is a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the
exchange of Sanderson Farms common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but
may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid
exemption from backup withholding tax.

disclosure and in the section entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms’ Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” below.

Under the Merger Agreement, Sanderson Farms must not, and must cause its subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives not to, among other
things and subject to certain exceptions:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the making or submission of an Alternative Proposal (as defined in the
section of the proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Approval of the Merger Agreement – Alternative Proposals; No Solicitation –
Alternative Proposal Definition”);
•
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-public information of
Sanderson Farms or any of its subsidiaries, in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an
Alternative Proposal;
•
enter into any letter of intent, understanding, agreement in principal or agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal; or
•
approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal.
However, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if Sanderson Farms receives an Alternative Proposal that did not
result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement that the Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal and financial advisors would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, Sanderson Farms may (subject
to certain limitations):
•
furnish nonpublic information to the third party making the Alternative Proposal, as well as its representatives and potential financing
sources; and
•
engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal.

The termination of the Merger Agreement by either party in connection with an Alternative Proposal may, under certain circumstances,

In addition to the circumstances described above, Parent and Sanderson Farms have certain rights to terminate the Merger Agreement under
customary circumstances, including by mutual agreement, the imposition of laws or non-appealable court orders that make the Merger illegal or
otherwise prohibit the Merger, an uncured breach of the Merger Agreement by the other party, if the Merger has not been consummated on or
before May 8, 2022 (which will automatically be extended to August 8, 2022 in certain circumstances), if the Sanderson Farms Stockholders fail to
approve the Merger Agreement at the Company Meeting (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Approval of the
Merger Agreement—Company Meeting”) (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) or, in the case of Sanderson Farms, in connection with a
Superior Proposal.
Under certain circumstances, Sanderson Farms will be required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to $158 million if (i) Sanderson Farms has
terminated the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing a Superior Proposal, in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement; (ii) Parent has terminated the Merger Agreement because of a Change of Recommendation; or (iii) in connection with an Alternative
Proposal (subject to certain other conditions). Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Approval of the Merger
Agreement—Company Termination Fee.”
Under certain circumstances, Parent will be required to pay a termination fee of $300 million should Parent either breach the Merger Agreement
by failing to consummate the closing of the Merger when it is required to do so or fail to pay the equity financing following the Company
Stockholder Approval at the closing of the Merger (subject to certain other conditions) and, in each case, certain closing conditions of the
Investment Agreement were not satisfied or waived, including the absence of a “material adverse effect” on Wayne Farms, which is defined similarly
with respect to Wayne Farms in the Investment Agreement to the manner in which a Company Material Adverse Effect is defined with respect to
Sanderson Farms under the Merger Agreement (a “Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect”).
Under certain circumstances, Parent will be required to pay a termination fee of $250 million if (i) Parent fails to secure the debt financing at the
closing of the Merger (other than as a result of the inability of the closing to occur under the Investment Agreement due to the failure of certain
conditions to the obligations of CMSC set forth in the Investment Agreement to have been satisfied or waived) following the Company Stockholder
Approval at the closing of the Merger (subject to certain other conditions) or (ii) the Antitrust Closing Condition (as defined in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Approval of the Merger Agreement—Parent Termination Fee”) is not satisfied (subject to certain other

Approval at the closing of the Merger (subject to certain other conditions) or (ii) the Antitrust Closing Condition is not satisfied (subject to certain other

Q: What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A: Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation
Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Sanderson Farms. Therefore, if the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the
Merger is completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Sanderson Farms’ named executive officers in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.

in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign, date and return,
as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you are a Beneficial
Owner, to vote your shares, please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q: Should I surrender my share certificates or book-entry shares now?
A: No. After the Merger is completed, the paying agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and written instructions that explain
how to exchange shares of Sanderson Farms common stock represented by such holder’s share certificates or book-entry shares for the Merger
Consideration.
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Sanderson Farms common stock after the Record Date but before the Special
Meeting?
A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If
you sell or transfer your shares of Sanderson Farms common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements
(such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies
Sanderson Farms in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to
the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or
otherwise transfer your shares of Sanderson Farms common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy
card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the
enclosed proxy card).
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a Beneficial Owner?
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to
be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Sanderson Farms.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered a Beneficial Owner. In that case, this proxy statement has been
forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the
Beneficial Owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting.
Q: How may I vote?
A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Sanderson Farms common stock are registered in your name with Computershare, our
transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;

Table of Contents
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Sanderson Farms common
stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over
the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur
costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Sanderson Farms common stock by
proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Sanderson
Farms common stock in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special
Meeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
If you are a Beneficial Owner, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by
your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by
telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form
provided by your bank, broker or nominee. You may also vote in person by obtaining a legal proxy. See “May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in
person?”
Q: If I am a Beneficial Owner, will my broker vote my shares for me?
A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against approval of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Sanderson Farms; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.
If you are a Beneficial Owner, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote.
Q: What is a proxy?
A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Sanderson Farms common stock. The written document describing
the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your
shares of Sanderson Farms common stock is called a “proxy card.” Mike Cockrell and Joe F. Sanderson, Jr. are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting,
with full power of substitution and re-substitution.

Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the
way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the approval of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each
brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive
more than one proxy card.
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A: Sanderson Farms intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting.
All reports that Sanderson Farms files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the fourth calendar quarter
of 2021 or in the first calendar quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject
to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q: Who can help answer my questions?

statement or need help voting your shares of Sanderson Farms common stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices located at 127 Flynt Road, Laurel, Mississippi
39443, during regular business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting and at the virtual meeting website during the Special
Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 22,328,507 shares of Sanderson Farms common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
The holders of a majority of the votes represented in person or by proxy entitled to be cast on a matter by voting Sanderson Farms Stockholders,
present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special
Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Sanderson Farms common stock is required to approve the Merger
Agreement. As of the Record Date, 14,885,672 votes constitute two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Sanderson Farms common stock. Approval of the
Merger Agreement by stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each require, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the shares of
Sanderson Farms common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter to exceed the
votes cast of the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter opposing such proposal.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal. For stockholders who
attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST”
any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement at
the time of the Special Meeting.

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to approve the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees
return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the Beneficial Owner of
such shares. Sanderson Farms does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other
nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be
presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Sanderson Farms common
stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote
“against” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.

As part of Sanderson Farms’ ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and
Sanderson Farms’ senior management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, periodically review, consider and assess Sanderson Farms’
operations and financial performance and overall industry conditions, as well as the Company’s succession plan, as they may affect those strategic goals
and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other
financial and strategic alternatives, including a potential expansion of its footprint through the construction of one or more new poultry complexes. The
Board of Directors has also regularly engaged with Sanderson Farms’ stockholders to discuss and solicit their perspectives on its strategic and financial
direction. In these discussions, Sanderson Farms consulted with Centerview, a long-standing financial advisor to Sanderson Farms, in connection with
various strategic and corporate finance matters, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”), Fishman Haygood LLP (“Fishman Haygood”)
and Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, PLLC (“Brunini”), its legal advisors (the “legal advisors”).
Beginning in September 2019, the Board of Directors determined to pursue a process to explore a potential strategic transaction, which process was
put on hold in early 2020 due to challenges in poultry markets and the COVID-19 pandemic.
On September 1, 2020, Sanderson Farms received an unsolicited proposal from Durational Capital Management (“Durational”) to acquire Sanderson
Farms for $142 per share in cash. Durational stated in its letter that it had recently acquired a large position in Sanderson Farms’ common stock. On
September 13, 2020, the Board of Directors, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the Durational proposal
significantly undervalued Sanderson Farms and its future prospects, and that the highly conditional and opportunistic proposal was not in the best
interests of Sanderson Farms or its stockholders. Sanderson Farms sent a letter to Durational on September 14, 2020, informing Durational of the Board of
Directors’ determination. Several weeks later, on October 29, 2020, Sanderson Farms was contacted by several news outlets asking Sanderson Farms
whether it could confirm that it had received an unsolicited proposal from Tyson Foods, Inc. (“Tyson Foods”) and Durational. In response, Sanderson
Farms determined to issue a statement the same day stating that it had received an unsolicited proposal from Durational, and not from Tyson Foods, and
that the Board of Directors had determined that the Durational proposal significantly undervalued Sanderson Farms and its future prospects, and that the
highly conditional and opportunistic proposal was not in the best interests of Sanderson Farms or its stockholders.
-29-Table of Contents
Throughout most of 2020 and the early months of 2021, Sanderson Farms and the Board of Directors remained focused on supporting Sanderson
Farms and its employees, growers and other independent contractors through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to health and
safety issues as well as potential supply chain issues, as well as the impact from higher feed prices. Early 2021 brought with it optimism as to the rebound
of the poultry markets for the rest of 2021, largely due to higher market prices for certain of Sanderson Farms products. The higher prices reflected
increased demand fueled in part by more customers preparing meals at home during the pandemic and the “chicken sandwich wars” among various quick
serve food service customers. Further, as vaccines against Covid-19 became more readily available, Sanderson Farms believed that demand from food
service customers, which had already begun to recover, would continue to rise as diners became more comfortable eating in-restaurant. In early spring
2021, the Board of Directors and members of management began discussing a potential sale of Sanderson Farms and other alternatives in light of these
favorable broader poultry industry trends, as well as Sanderson Farms’ overall strategic plan and competitive position.
Subsequently, at a virtual meeting held on March 30, 2021, the Board of Directors discussed and reviewed, together with Centerview and its legal
advisors, Sanderson Farms’ business and strategic plan and a range of strategic alternatives potentially available to Sanderson Farms. Representatives of
Centerview discussed a range of potential strategic alternatives based on management’s long-term forecasts, including continuing to execute on its
standalone plan, conducting various capital allocation or capital return alternatives, including potential share repurchases or regular or special dividends,
an acquisition or series of acquisitions, a separation of its Foods division, a potential sale of Sanderson Farms, and considerations associated with each
alternative. Members of management also presented an updated version of the Sanderson Farms’ five-year financial forecast model to the Board of
Directors and discussed key assumptions underlying such model. Representatives of Centerview also provided the Board of Directors with an overview
of a potential process for the sale of Sanderson Farms, including illustrative timelines and stages for such process and potential counterparties that might
be interested in such a transaction. These potential counterparties were selected based on strategic fit, financial and administrative capacity to
consummate a potential transaction, likelihood of completion (including as it related to receipt of any required regulatory approvals), as well as capacity
to efficiently assess interest in a potential transaction. The Board of Directors, together with management and representatives of Centerview, discussed
the list of potential counterparties and various considerations associated with reaching out to, and pursuing a strategic transaction with, such parties.
After discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors determined to explore more intensively a potential sale of Sanderson Farms, authorized
representatives of Centerview to contact certain of these potential counterparties to ascertain their interest in a strategic transaction involving Sanderson
Farms, and authorized the legal advisors, working with management, to negotiate and execute non-disclosure agreements with potential counterparties.
Commencing on April 12, 2021, representatives of Centerview began contacting the potential counterparties regarding a potential strategic
transaction. Representatives of Centerview contacted twelve potential counterparties that the Board of Directors had authorized Centerview to contact at
the meeting of the Board of Directors held on March 30, 2021. Seven of the twelve potential counterparties (including each of CGC and Cargill) entered
into non-disclosure agreements with Sanderson Farms and were provided with preliminary due diligence materials. All seven of the non-disclosure
agreements included standstill provisions, and none of the standstill provisions remain in effect.
On April 21 and 22, 2021, representatives of CGC and Cargill contacted Centerview and requested permission to partner with one another and
submit a joint bid (collectively, the “Bidder Group”), as required under their respective non-disclosure agreements, which approval was granted by
Sanderson Farms’ management, based on its belief that such partnering would create more actionable bids and enhance value.
On May 4, 2021, representatives of Centerview sent a process letter to each of the seven counterparties that had entered into non-disclosure
agreements with Sanderson Farms, requesting preliminary indications of interest by May 19, 2021.
On May 19, 2021, two potential counterparties submitted preliminary indications of interest to acquire Sanderson Farms for cash: the Bidder Group,
which indicated a price of $200.00 per share; and a second bidder
-30-
Table of Contents
(“Bidder 2”), which indicated a price range of $200.00 to $206.00 per share. The Bidder Group contemplated effectuating the potential transaction through
the acquisition of Sanderson Farms by an entity jointly owned by each of CGC and Cargill, into which CGC would contribute its ownership interests in
Wayne Farms and Cargill would contribute cash equity. The remaining four potential counterparties that had executed non-disclosure agreements with
Sanderson Farms did not provide preliminary indications of interest to acquire Sanderson Farms, indicating to representatives of Centerview that they
were withdrawing from the process for a range of reasons, including the fact that they were interested in certain portions and not the whole of Sanderson
Farms’ business or assets, that they were concerned with the certainty of completion of the strategic combination, that a potential acquisition would be
too large for them to finance, or that they were focused on other strategic priorities.
At a virtual meeting held on May 24, 2021, the Board of Directors discussed and reviewed, together with Centerview and its legal advisors, the
preliminary indications of interest received from the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, and other alternatives including continuing to operate Sanderson Farms
on a stand-alone basis. Representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton discussed and reviewed with the Board of Directors these various potential
strategic alternatives, and summarized the terms and conditions of the indications of interest, discussing with the Board of Directors the key assumptions
underlying the indicative valuations included in the preliminary indications of interest, proposed financing plans, timing and required internal and external
approvals, as well as diligence requests made by the potential counterparties. Representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton also provided the
Board of Directors with a comprehensive outline for the next stages of the strategic process leading up to the announcement of a potential transaction
with either of the potential counterparties, including the scheduling of management presentations and site visits, as well as the preparation and
negotiation of definitive agreements with respect to such a transaction. Following discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors authorized
Sanderson Farms’ advisors, working with management, to proceed with the Sanderson Farms’ process to explore the sale of itself, permit each of the
Bidder Group and Bidder 2 with access to additional diligence on Sanderson Farms, and to schedule management presentations and site visits with
representatives of each of the Bidder Group and Bidder 2.
On June 2, 2021, representatives of Centerview received an inbound inquiry from a financial advisor representing an industry participant who had
not previously been contacted by Centerview as part of this strategic process (“Bidder 3”). Bidder 3 thereafter entered into a non-disclosure agreement
with Sanderson Farms which included a standstill provision which no longer remains in effect. On June 8, 2021, Bidder 3 withdrew from the process
because of concerns regarding financing a potential acquisition on the proposed timeline.
On June 4, 2021, Sanderson Farms provided representatives of the Bidder Group and Bidder 2 with access to the virtual data room.
Between June 9 and June 11, 2021, the Bidder Group and its representatives and Bidder 2 and its representatives, including a potential equity
financing source for Bidder 2, participated in separate full-day management meetings and diligence sessions hosted by Sanderson Farms in New York,
New York and supervised by Centerview and Wachtell Lipton. Each meeting was preceded by dinner with the presentation’s participants, together with
representatives of Centerview, the prior evening. Following these meetings, members of management and Sanderson Farms’ advisors had numerous
follow-up calls and email exchanges with representatives of each of the bidders to provide additional business and financial due diligence.
On June 11, 2021, representatives of Centerview received another inbound inquiry from a financial advisor representing a financial sponsor who
had not previously been contacted by Centerview as part of this strategic process (“Bidder 4”). The Company ultimately determined not to engage with
Bidder 4 as Bidder 4 did not provide any financing plans or indicate a price range in their proposal.
From time to time, representatives of Centerview also received inbound inquiries on the status of a potential transaction from former potential
counterparties that had since withdrawn from the process. None of these former potential counterparties expressed any interest in reengaging in the
process with respect to an acquisition of the entire Company.

Also on June 11, 2021, representatives of CGC notified representatives of Centerview that representatives of the Wall Street Journal had contacted
representatives of CGC regarding a leak with respect to a potential transaction between Sanderson Farms and CGC.
At a remote meeting held on June 13, 2021, representatives of Centerview provided the Board of Directors with an update on the strategic process,
including the progress on business and financial due diligence by each of the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, the receipt of inbound inquiries from Bidder 3
and Bidder 4, and CGC’s notification of the leak. Representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of Directors potential
strategies and responses should individual members of the Board of Directors be contacted by press or stockholders concerning the leak.
On June 21, 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that Sanderson Farms was in discussions with multiple parties, including CGC, in connection
with a potential sale.
On June 30, 2021, representatives of Centerview sent a process letter to the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, requesting final proposals by July 20, 2021.
On July 6, 2021, Sanderson Farms circulated a form of merger agreement to the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, and instructed the bidders to contact
Wachtell Lipton with any questions.
Between May and July 2021, representatives of the Bidder Group participated in site visits in Texas, Mississippi and North Carolina and more than
a dozen virtual diligence meetings with management, which virtual diligence meetings were supervised by Sanderson Farms’ financial and legal advisors.
Members of management also responded, through Sanderson Farms’ advisors, to numerous follow-up diligence requests and questions from the bidders
after these meetings. Bidder 2 and its representatives continued to conduct limited diligence on Sanderson Farms, but informed representatives of
Centerview that they were having difficulties with obtaining the requisite financing for a potential acquisition.
On July 14, 2021, representatives of Bidder 2 indicated to representatives of Centerview that they would not be in a position to submit a final
proposal and withdrew from the process because they were unable to secure the requisite financing for a potential acquisition.
On or about July 16, 2021, representatives of CGC contacted representatives of Centerview to convey that the Bidder Group could not come to
agreed terms with respect to the Investment Agreement in light of certain terms in the draft Merger Agreement, and as a result would not be in a position
to submit a final proposal by July 20, 2021. Over the course of July 17, 2021 and July 18, 2021, representatives of Centerview discussed with
representatives CGC certain terms of the draft Merger Agreement in the context of the Investment Agreement. On July 19, 2021, representatives of the
Bidder Group contacted representatives of Centerview to convey that the Bidder Group would submit a final proposal on July 20, 2021, and previewed
certain terms in the Bidder Group’s markup of the draft Merger Agreement and their Investment Agreement that would be important in order for the
Bidder Group to move forward, including that the cash equity contribution funded by Cargill under the Investment Agreement would be conditioned on
the absence of the occurrence of a Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect.
On July 20, 2021, representatives of the Bidder Group submitted a final proposal to acquire Sanderson Farms for $202.00 per share in cash. In
addition to its final proposal, the Bidder Group submitted a mark-up of the draft Merger Agreement and accompanying disclosure schedules, an executed
commitment letter and redacted fee letter from Bank of America, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc. and Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. for up to $3.25 billion in
senior secured credit facilities in connection with the transaction, and a redacted draft Investment Agreement providing for the contribution by CGC of its
ownership interests in Wayne Farms and the equity financing from CMSC (an affiliate of Cargill), which the equity financing would be conditioned on,
among other things, the absence of the occurrence of a Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect.
At an in-person meeting held on July 22, 2021 (with some attendees joining virtually), the Board of Directors discussed the terms of the Bidder
Group’s final proposal. Representatives of Centerview provided an
-32-
Table of Contents
overview of the strategic process leading up to the date of the meeting, and summarized the material terms of the Bidder Group’s final proposal.
Representatives of Wachtell Lipton then provided a summary of the terms reflected in the current draft of the transaction documents as submitted by the
Bidder Group. Members of management also presented an updated version of Sanderson Farms’ five-year financial forecast model to the Board of
Directors and discussed key assumptions underlying such model. The updated forecast model reflected increased earnings expectations for the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2021 as a result of improvements in poultry markets but was otherwise substantially the same as the forecast model presented at
the meeting of the Board of Directors held on March 30, 2021. Following discussion, representatives of Centerview reviewed with the Board of Directors
the premiums and multiples implied by the Bidder Group’s final proposal in the context of trading multiples for selected public companies and multiples
implied by selected precedent transactions. The Board of Directors then engaged in a discussion regarding the valuation of Sanderson Farms implied by
the Bidder Group’s $202.00 per share proposal in the context of the analyses provided by Centerview, as well as the assumptions underlying
management’s projections and the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving such projections. The Board of Directors discussed next steps as
well as strategies for seeking an increase in the price and an improvement in the other terms offered by the Bidder Group in their final proposal.
Between July 22, 2021 and July 24, 2021, management continued to refine Sanderson Farms’ counterproposal with Centerview and Sanderson
Farms’ legal advisors, based on the direction provided by the Board of Directors.
On July 25, 2021, representatives of Centerview contacted representatives of the Bidder Group to convey Sanderson Farms’ counterproposal,
which included a cash merger consideration of $206.00 per share as well as Sanderson Farms’ position on certain issues concerning regulatory approvals,
certain employee matters, the amount and circumstances pursuant to which certain termination fees would be payable and remedies available to the party
in the case of a willful and intentional breach by the other party.
Later that day, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”), CGC’s
legal advisor, and representatives of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (“Freshfields”), Cargill’s legal advisor, a revised draft of the Merger
Agreement reflecting the counterproposal as conveyed by Centerview.
On July 27, 2021, representatives of the Bidder Group provided a revised proposal to acquire Sanderson Farms for $203.00 per share in cash, and
conveyed to representatives of Centerview and representatives of Wachtell Lipton (through their legal advisors) their proposal concerning the issues
regarding regulatory approvals, certain employee matters, termination fees and remedies in the event of a willful and intentional breach of the Merger
Agreement.
Also on July 27, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Paul Weiss and Freshfields a revised draft of the disclosure
schedules, Investment Agreement and debt commitment letter.
On August 2, 2021, at the request of the Board of Directors in order to help better assess the risk as to whether a Wayne Farms Material Adverse
Effect could occur, thereby relieving Cargill of its obligation to fund the cash equity contribution pursuant to the Investment Agreement, members of
Sanderson Farms’ management and its legal and financial advisors attended a general diligence session hosted by representatives of Wayne Farms. A
further session was held on August 3, 2021 among the parties’ respective legal counsels to discuss certain legal matters pertaining to Wayne Farms.
From July 27, 2021 to August 7, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the Merger Agreement and other transaction
documents with representatives of Paul Weiss and Freshfields and held several calls to negotiate the final terms of such documents. During this period,
representatives of Centerview also held several calls with representatives of CGC and Cargill to discuss open issues. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton
negotiated several legal issues with representatives of Paul Weiss and Freshfields, including issues relating to termination fees and remedies, the
treatment of equity awards and employee matters, and the remedies of the parties (including the right to specific performance and damages in the event of
a termination of the Merger Agreement).

At a virtual meeting held on August 7, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided the Board of Directors with a summary of the terms of the
draft of the Merger Agreement and financing documents, noting changes from the summary of the Merger Agreement previously provided to the Board
of Directors. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided a summary of the proposed employment and compensation arrangements between certain
members of management and the Bidder Group following the consummation of the proposed transaction, as well as the regulatory approvals that will be
required in connection with the transaction, and the covenants of the parties in the draft transaction documents related to such regulatory efforts.
Management then provided the Board of Directors with a summary of its financial and business due diligence on Wayne Farms, referencing a diligence
report previously provided to the Board of Directors. Representatives of Centerview then reviewed with the Board of Directors their valuation analyses
with respect to Sanderson Farms based on management’s projections. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton, assisted by representatives of Brunini and
Fishman Haygood, discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Mississippi law in connection with a potential sale of Sanderson
Farms. Following this discussion, representatives of Centerview left the meeting, at which point representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Fishman
Haygood reviewed Centerview’s draft engagement letter and relationships disclosure letter made available to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting.
The representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Fishman Haygood discussed Centerview’s relationships with CGC, Cargill and/or their respective affiliates
that had been disclosed. The Board of Directors reviewed the disclosures and determined that none of Centerview’s disclosed relationships with CGC,
Cargill and/or their respective affiliates constituted a disqualifying conflict with respect to its engagement by Sanderson Farms in connection with the
potential transaction. After further discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors unanimously approved Sanderson Farms’ entry into the
engagement letter with Centerview.
Later that day, following the board meeting, Sanderson Farms entered into the engagement letter with Centerview.
On August 8, 2021, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting to discuss and consider whether to approve Sanderson Farms’ entry into definitive
transaction documents providing for a merger of Sanderson Farms with and into an affiliate of the Bidder Group. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton,
assisted by representatives of Brunini and Fishman Haygood, discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Mississippi law in
connection with a potential sale of Sanderson Farms. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton then summarized the terms of the draft of the Merger Agreement
and financing documents compared to the terms previously reviewed, referencing the summary of the Merger Agreement previously provided to the
Board of Directors. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided a summary of the proposed employment and compensation arrangements between
certain members of management and the Bidder Group following the consummation of the proposed transaction, as well as the regulatory approvals that
will be required in connection with the transaction, and the covenants of the parties in the draft transaction documents related to such regulatory efforts.
The members of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) convened a meeting and approved the
proposed employment and compensation arrangements in connection with the proposed transaction. Thereafter, representatives of Centerview presented
to the Board of Directors Centerview’s financial analysis and rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in
writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the
assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, as set forth in its written opinion, the $203.00 per share in cash
to be paid to the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following
this discussion, representatives of Centerview left the meeting, at which point the Board of Directors discussed with the legal advisors their perspectives
on the proposed transaction. After further discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the transaction documents and the
Merger and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Sanderson Farms approve the Merger Agreement.
Later that day, following the board meeting, the parties executed the final agreements.
The parties issued a joint press release announcing the transaction early in the morning of August 9, 2021.

SANDERSON FARMS INC_20210913_DEFM14A_19528141_4293580.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board of Directors,"Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors, in consultation with the legal advisors and financial advisors and the management team, evaluated the Merger Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and unanimously (i) determined that it is fair to and in the best interests
of Sanderson Farms and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) adopted the plan of merger set forth in this
Merger Agreement, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iv) recommends the approval of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Sanderson Farms.
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board of Directors considered a number of positive factors relating to the Merger Agreement and
the Merger, each of which the Board of Directors believed supported its decision, including the following:
Premium and Multiples. The Board of Directors considered the current and historical market prices of the common stock, including the market
performance of the common stock relative to those of other participants in Sanderson Farms’ sector and general market indices, and the fact that the
merger consideration of $203.00 per share in cash represents a substantial premium to estimates of Sanderson Farms’ unaffected stock price, including a
premium of 30.3% to Sanderson Farms’ stock price on June 19, 2021, the trading day immediately prior to the leak published in the Wall Street Journal, a
premium of 22.8% to Sanderson Farms’ 30-day volume-weighted average stock price as of June 18, 2021 and a premium of 15.2% to Sanderson Farms’ all-
time high stock price as of June 18, 2021.
Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value / Thorough Process. The Board of Directors considered that the present value of the merger
consideration of $203.00 in cash per share was more favorable to Sanderson Farms’ stockholders than the potential value that might result from other
alternatives reasonably available to Sanderson Farms, including, but not limited to, special dividends or distributions, leveraged stock repurchases, an
acquisition or a series of acquisitions, an asset sale or divestiture of a business segment of Sanderson Farms, and the continued operation of Sanderson
Farms on a stand-alone basis in light of a number of factors, including the following:
•
That positive macroeconomic and industry factors, including increased demand in the Company’s products and the resurgence of the
poultry industry post-Covid 19, as well as internal factors, such as Sanderson Farms’ valuation and management’s projections, suggested
that this would be an opportune time to explore a sale process and obtain maximum value for Sanderson Farms’ stockholders;
•
That Sanderson Farms had conducted a lengthy and thorough process since the Board of Directors’ decision to explore a strategic process
on March 30, 2021, involving outreach to 12 potential acquirers and inbound inquiries from 2 potential acquirers, of which 8 entered into
non-disclosure agreements with Sanderson Farms and received due diligence, 2 provided first round indications of interest, and one party
— the Bidder Group — provided a final definitive proposal;
•
That the Bidder Group stated the $203.00 in cash per share proposal represented the Bidder Group’s best and final proposal following the
Board of Directors’ rejection of the Bidder Group’s first two proposed final proposals, offering, respectively, $200.00 per share and $202.00
per share;
•
That the fact that Sanderson Farms was exploring a strategic transaction was well publicized since the leak published in the Wall Street
Journal (including through various subsequent news reports) and that Sanderson Farms and Centerview responded to third parties who
expressed interest in a possible transaction on an unsolicited basis and who they believed were reasonably capable of consummating a
transaction, by offering such third parties the opportunity to conduct due diligence and make a proposal, subject only to the requirement
that they enter into a customary non-disclosure agreement; and
•
That the Board of Directors had conducted extensive deliberations over a period of five months in connection with the strategic process, at
both regularly scheduled and special meetings attended by all members of the Board of Directors, to discuss updates regarding the strategic
process.
-35-Table of Contents
Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presentation of Centerview and the oral opinion of
Centerview rendered to the Board of Directors on August 8, 2021, which were subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and
qualifications to the review undertaken, as set forth in Centerview’s written opinion, the $203.00 per share in cash to be paid to the holders of shares of
common stock in the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled “—
Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC.”
Greater Certainty of Value. The Board of Directors considered that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, so that the transaction allows
Sanderson Farms’ stockholders to realize a fair value for their investment and provides such stockholders certainty of value for their shares, especially
when viewed against the risks inherent in Sanderson Farms’ business, including the following:
•
That Sanderson Farms’ business plan and the Management Projections (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger—Management Projections”) are based, in part, on projections for a number of variables, including feed grain costs, poultry markets
and chicken prices, the cost to build new facilities and continue Sanderson Farms’ organic growth strategy, global macroeconomic
conditions, labor costs and availability, and the strength and timing of post-pandemic economic growth, that are difficult to project and
subject to certain market and sector risks not viewed by management as within the control of Sanderson Farms;
•
That the financial projections set forth in the Management Projections were subject to certain market and sector risks not viewed by
management as within the control of Sanderson Farms that, based upon the Board of Directors’ knowledge of Sanderson Farms’ business,
as well as the views expressed by stockholders, potential counterparties, and market analysts with respect to broader sector conditions and
competitive dynamics might adversely affect Sanderson Farms’ ability to realize the Management Projections; and
•
That the Board of Directors believed the merger consideration was fair in light of Sanderson Farms’ business, operations, financial
condition, strategy and prospects as well as Sanderson Farms’ historical financial performance and projected financial performance as
reflected in the Management Projections.
Likelihood of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the likelihood of completion of the Merger in light of the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the closing conditions, including:
•
The commitment of Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to complete the Merger as soon as
practicable, including to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, and to obtain antitrust approvals,
subject to actions that would have material adverse effect on the post-closing business of Parent and its subsidiaries (including the
surviving corporation);
•
The fact that Parent had obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable financial institutions and committed equity
financing from CMSC for the full amount of equity required in connection with the committed debt financing, the limited number and nature
of the conditions to the debt and equity financing, and the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the financing and that such financing provides funding of an amount sufficient for the satisfaction of Parent’s and Merger
Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement, including the payment of the merger consideration, and any payments in respect of equity
compensation, fees and expenses, and any repayment of any outstanding indebtedness of Sanderson Farms;
•
Sanderson Farms’ ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to enforce the
equity financing commitment and to cause Parent to cause CMSC to fund the equity financing and Holdings to fund its contribution of its
equity financing commitment and to cause Parent to cause CMSC to fund the equity financing and Holdings to fund its contribution of its
membership interests in Wayne Farms as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Investment Agreement;
-36-
Table of Contents
•
Sanderson Farms’ view that the Investment Agreement reflects an arm’s-length agreement between Cargill and CGC, and their respective
subsidiaries, after conducting considerable diligence on one another and contains very limited exceptions for either party to be relieved of
its obligations to be performed under the Investment Agreement, including Cargill’s obligation to fund the equity financing;
•
The fact that Wayne Farms has agreed to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business before completion of the Merger, including
covenants to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course and not take any
action or omit to take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the conditions to Cargill’s obligation to fund
the equity financing under the Investment Agreement;
•
The commitment of Parent in the Merger Agreement to pay Sanderson Farms a termination fee in an amount equal to $300 million in the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a Parent financing failure as a result of a material adverse effect on Wayne Farms, or
$250 million in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a Parent financing failure that did not result from a Wayne Farms
Material Adverse Effect or due to a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger Agreement — Parent Termination Fees”); and
•
The conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are limited in number and scope, and which, in the case of the
condition related to the accuracy of Sanderson Farms representations and warranties, are generally subject to certain materiality or material
adverse effect qualifiers.
Opportunity to Receive Alternative Proposals and to Terminate the Merger Agreement in Order to Accept a Superior Proposal. The Board of
Directors considered the terms of the Merger Agreement relating to Sanderson Farms’ ability to respond to unsolicited alternative proposals, and the
other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
•
Sanderson Farms’ right, subject to certain conditions, to provide information in response to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain
unsolicited alternative proposals made before the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained;
•
The provisions of the Merger Agreement allowing the Board of Directors to make a change of recommendation prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, subject to Parent’s right
to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment of a termination fee of $158 million; and
•
The fact that as of the date of this proxy statement, since the announcement of the transaction with the Bidding Group, no person has made
an unsolicited offer or proposal to acquire Sanderson Farms.
Opportunity for Sanderson Farms Stockholders to Vote. The Board of Directors also considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the
approval of the Sanderson Farms Stockholders, and the Sanderson Farms Stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the
approval of the Merger Agreement at the Sanderson Farms stockholders’ meeting.
Treatment of Employees. The Board of Directors considered that the Merger Agreement provided for attractive post-closing compensation and
other benefits to employees, and that the treatment of the restricted common stock and performance share awards was fair to employee holders, as more
fully described below in the section entitled “— Treatment of Company Equity Awards”;
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board of Directors also considered certain risks and potentially adverse factors relating to the
Merger Agreement and the Merger, including:
•
That Sanderson Farms’ stockholders will not be entitled to any ongoing equity participation in Sanderson Farms following the Merger, and
that such stockholders will therefore cease to participate in Sanderson Farms’ future earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases,
if any, in the value of Sanderson Farms’ common stock following the Merger;
-37-
Table of Contents
•
The provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict Sanderson Farms’ ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions, and that restrict Sanderson Farms from entering into alternative
acquisition agreements;
•
The possibility that the Merger is not completed in a timely manner or at all for any reason, including as a result of the failure to receive the
required regulatory approvals or as a result of there having been a Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect, the latter being an event over
which Sanderson Farms would have little or no ability to prevent from occurring;
•
The risks and costs to Sanderson Farms if the Merger is not completed or if there is uncertainty about the likelihood, timing or effects of
completion of the Merger, including uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on the employees, customers, growers, producers, vendors
of Sanderson Farms and other third parties, which could impair Sanderson Farms’ ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and
could cause third parties to seek to terminate, change or not enter into business relationships with Sanderson Farms, as well as the risk of
management distraction from ongoing business operations as a result of the Merger, and the effect on the trading price of Sanderson Farms
common stock if the Merger Agreement is terminated or the Merger is not completed for any reason;
•
The Merger Agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of Sanderson Farms’ business before completion of the Merger, generally requiring
Sanderson Farms to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course and preserve
intact in all material respects its business organization, employee relationships, assets and properties, its existence in good standing, and its
business relationships, and prohibiting Sanderson Farms from taking specified actions, which could delay or prevent Sanderson Farms from
undertaking certain business opportunities that arise pending completion of the Merger;
•
The possibility that Sanderson Farms could be required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to pay a termination fee of $158 million
under certain circumstances (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Company Termination Fee”), and
that such termination fee could discourage other potential bidders from making a competing bid to acquire Sanderson Farms;
•
The fact that Sanderson Farms’ remedies in the event of a willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
would be capped at $425 million (or, under certain circumstances, $300 million);
•
The unavailability of appraisal rights under Mississippi law to holders of shares of common stock who do not vote in favor of the approval
of the Merger Agreement, which would deprive such stockholders of the opportunity to have a court determine the fair value of their
shares, which may be more than, less than, or the same as the amount such stockholders would receive under the Merger Agreement;
•
That the receipt of cash by Sanderson Farms’ stockholders in exchange for their shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will
generally be a taxable transaction to the Sanderson Farms Stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
•
That some of the Sanderson Farms’ directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests
of the Sanderson Farms Stockholders generally. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Interests of Sanderson Farms’ Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors includes the material factors considered by the
Board of Directors but is not intended to be exhaustive and does not necessarily include all of the factors considered by the Board of Directors. In view
of the complexity and variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board of Directors did
not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and

Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC
On August 8, 2021, Centerview rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated August 8,
2021, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Sanderson Farms
common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

to the Company prepared by management of the Company and furnished to Centerview by the Company for purposes of Centerview’s
analysis, which are referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “Forecasts,” and which are collectively referred to in this
summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “Internal Data.”
Centerview also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the Company regarding their
assessment of the Internal Data. In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for the
Company and compared that data with similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that
Centerview deemed relevant. Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the financial terms, to the extent
publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview deemed relevant, and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into
account such other information as Centerview deemed appropriate.
Centerview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with the
Company’s consent, Centerview relied upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at the Company’s
direction, that the Internal Data (including, without limitation, the Forecasts) were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby and Centerview relied, at the Company’s direction, on the
Internal Data for purposes of Centerview’s analysis and opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the Internal Data or the assumptions on
which it was based. In addition, at the Company’s direction, Centerview did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company, nor was Centerview furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal,
and was not asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. Centerview assumed, at the
Company’s direction, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any respect material to Centerview’s analysis or opinion from the
execution version reviewed by Centerview. Centerview also assumed, at the Company’s direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver,
modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion
and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no
delay, limitation, restriction, condition or other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s
opinion. Centerview did not evaluate and did not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of the Company, or the ability of the Company to
pay its obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the Transaction on such matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Centerview is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisor, and Centerview expressed no opinion as to any
legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
Centerview’s opinion expressed no view as to, and did not address, the Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the
Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the
Company or in which the Company might engage. Centerview’s opinion was limited to and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as
of the date of Centerview’s written opinion, to the holders of Sanderson Farms common stock (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration
to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For purposes of its opinion, Centerview was not asked to, and Centerview did not, express
any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Transaction, including, without limitation, the
structure or form of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into in connection with
or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the Transaction or any other term or aspect of the Transaction
to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of the Company or any other party. In addition, Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount, nature or any

other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any party, or class of such
persons in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Sanderson Farms common stock
(other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Centerview’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic,
monetary, currency, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to Centerview as of, the date of
Centerview’s written opinion, and Centerview does not have any obligation or responsibility to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion based on

recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the
Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. Centerview’s financial advisory services and its written opinion were
provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and
for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. The issuance of Centerview’s opinion was approved by the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness
Opinion Committee.
Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board of Directors in connection with Centerview’s
opinion, dated August 8, 2021. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors
considered by, and underlying the opinion of, Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or
weight given to those financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be taken to be Centerview’s
view of the actual value of the Company. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular
format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the tables below without considering all
financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
such analyses or factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In
performing its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company or any other parties to the Transaction. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
Wayne Farms or Centerview or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates
contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the Company do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at
which the Company may actually be sold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market
data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 6, 2021, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Selected Public Company Analysis
Centerview reviewed certain financial information relating to the Company and compared it to corresponding financial information of certain
publicly traded companies that Centerview selected based on its experience and professional judgment.
Although neither of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, the companies listed below were chosen by Centerview, among
other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies that are vertically-integrated poultry producers, although both also compete in other lines of
business. The financial data that was used with respect to these selected companies was based on the selected companies’ SEC filings and other data
sources as of August 6, 2021.
-41-
Table of Contents
However, because neither of the selected companies is exactly the same as the Company, Centerview believed it was inappropriate to, and therefore
did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based
on its experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the operational, business and/or financial characteristics of the Company
and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the
quantitative analysis.
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated, for each of the selected companies, the company’s enterprise value (referred to as EV)
(calculated as the equity value (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options and other equity
awards and convertible securities, as applicable) plus the face value of debt and certain liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and certain other
investments), as a multiple of consensus estimates (drawn from FactSet, a data source containing historical and estimated financial data) of such selected
company’s estimated EBITDA for the years 2021 and 2022, in each case conformed to the Company’s fiscal year ending October 31 using annual time
weighting. Based on its experience and professional judgment and taking into account the Company’s higher earnings volatility relative to the selected
companies and the Company’s historical discount to the median EV/NTM (next twelve month) EBITDA of the selected companies during periods of
elevated profitability, Centerview applied a downward adjustment of 25% to the median EV/EBITDA multiples for the selected companies. The selected
companies and the results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis Centerview selected an enterprise value to estimated fiscal year
2021 EBITDA multiple reference range of 5.5x to 7.0x and an enterprise value to estimated fiscal year 2022 EBITDA multiple reference range of 5.0x to 6.5x.
In selecting these reference ranges, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences
between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of the Company and the selected comparable companies that could affect
their public trading values in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.
With respect to the fiscal year 2021 analysis, Centerview applied the EBITDA multiple reference range to the Company’s estimated fiscal year 2021
EBITDA of $626 million, as set forth in the Forecasts, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Centerview added to each of these
ranges of implied enterprise values the Company’s estimated net cash at July 31, 2021 as set forth in the Internal Data to derive a range of implied equity
values for the Company. Centerview then divided these implied equity values by the number of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock outstanding as
of July 31, 2021 (on a fully diluted basis but excluding the Company Performance Share Awards (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) as set forth in the
Internal Data, which resulted in a range of implied values per share of Sanderson Farms common stock of $163 to $205 (rounded to the nearest $1.00).
Centerview then compared the results of the above analysis to the Merger Consideration of $203 per share of Sanderson Farms common stock in cash,
without interest, to be paid to the holders of Sanderson Farms common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
With respect to the fiscal year 2022 analysis, Centerview applied the EBITDA multiple reference range to the Company’s estimated fiscal year 2022
EBITDA of $653 million, as set forth in the Forecasts, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Centerview added to each of these
ranges of implied enterprise values the Company’s estimated net cash at July 31, 2021 as set forth in the Internal Data to derive a range of implied equity
values for the Company. Centerview then divided these implied equity values by the number of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock outstanding as
of July 31, 2021 (on a fully diluted basis but excluding the Company Performance Share Awards) as set forth in the Internal Data, which resulted in a range
of
-42-
Table of Contents
implied values per share of Sanderson Farms common stock of $155 to $199 (rounded to the nearest $1.00). Centerview then compared the results of the
above analysis to the Merger Consideration of $203 per share of Sanderson Farms common stock in cash, without interest, to be paid to the holders of
Sanderson Farms common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Centerview reviewed and compared certain information relating to the following selected transactions that Centerview, based on its professional
judgment and experience, deemed relevant to consider in relation to the Company and the Transaction.
However, because no company or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Company or the Transaction,
Centerview believed it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected precedent transaction analysis.
Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the
operational, business, financial and/or cyclical characteristics of the Company and each selected target company as well as the Transaction and the
selected transactions that could affect the transaction values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative
analysis. Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Transaction, the transactions listed below were chosen by Centerview
because, among other reasons, their business characteristics, end-market focus, size and/or other factors, for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, may be
considered similar to the Transaction. Centerview used its experience, expertise and knowledge of these industries to select transactions that involved
companies with certain operational, business and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain
characteristics of the Company. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected transactions analyzed were diverse and there are
inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of the Company and the companies included in the selected
transactions analysis.
The selected precedent transactions considered in this analysis are summarized as follows:

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of August 6, 2021, Centerview calculated, for each
selected transaction, the enterprise value implied for the applicable target company based on the consideration payable in the applicable selected
transactions as a multiple of the target company’s EBITDA for the last 12-month period, or closest comparable disclosed metric, which Centerview refers
to as LTM (unless otherwise noted), for which financial information had been made public at the time of the announcement of such transactions.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected precedent transactions and other considerations that Centerview deemed
relevant in its professional judgment and experience, Centerview selected a multiple reference range of enterprise value to estimated 10-year Normalized
EBITDA of 8.5x to 10.5x. “Normalized EBITDA” is defined for this purpose as the average EBITDA per pound over the most recent trailing 10 fiscal years,
up to and including the estimated and unreported value for fiscal year 2021 (as reported in the Forecasts), multiplied by the estimated and unreported
pounds sold in fiscal year 2021 (as reported in the Forecasts). Normalized EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is intended to provide supplemental
performance information and present multiples in the view of the cyclicality and earnings volatility of the protein producing industries. In light of both the
Company’s volatility in LTM EBITDA and the range of periods in the business cycle at which the selected transactions in the transaction analysis were
executed, Centerview felt it was more appropriate to apply the Normalized EBITDA metric, rather than LTM EBITDA, as Normalized EBITDA better
measures the Company’s average profitability through business cycles.
In selecting the enterprise value to estimated 10-year Normalized EBITDA multiple reference range of 8.5x to 10.5x, Centerview made qualitative
judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and
prospects of the Company and the target companies included in the selected transactions and other factors that could affect the public trading,
acquisition or other values of such companies or the Company in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.
Centerview then applied this reference range to the Company’s Normalized EBITDA (the calculation of which included the estimated 2021 EBITDA, as set
forth in the Forecasts) of $418 million. Centerview added to this range of implied enterprise values the Company’s estimated net cash at July 31, 2021 as
set forth in the Internal Data to derive a range of implied equity values for the Company. Centerview then divided this range of implied equity values by
the number of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock outstanding as of July 31, 2021 (on a fully diluted basis but excluding the Company Performance
Share Awards) as set forth in the Internal Data, which resulted in a range of implied values per share of Sanderson Farms common stock of $168 to $206,
rounded to the nearest $1.00. Centerview then compared this range to the Merger Consideration of $203 per share of Sanderson Farms common stock in
cash, without interest, to be paid to the holders of Sanderson Farms common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on the Forecasts and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts
of unlevered free cash flows of the Company set forth under the section of the proxy statement entitled “—Management Projections.” A discounted cash
flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or set of assets by calculating the “present value” of estimated
future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those
future cash flows by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected
returns and other appropriate factors.
-44-
Table of Contents
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of implied equity values for the Company’s shares of Sanderson Farms common stock by
(a) discounting to present value, as of July 31, 2021, using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of the Company’s
weighted average cost of capital) and the mid-year convention: (i) the forecasted unlevered free cash flows of the Company over the period beginning
August 1, 2021 and ending October 31, 2025 as set forth in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of implied terminal enterprise values of the Company, calculated
by Centerview using perpetuity growth rates of 1.0% to 2.0% (reflecting Centerview’s professional judgement of the Company’s potential long-term cash
flow growth rate) which implied a range of EBITDA multiples of 6.7x to 9.1x based on the Company’s forecasted terminal year EBITDA and (b) adding to
the foregoing results the Company’s estimated net cash at July 31, 2021, as set forth in the Internal Data. Centerview then divided these implied equity
values by the number of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock outstanding as of July 31, 2021 (on a fully diluted basis but excluding the Company
Performance Share Awards) as set forth in the Internal Data, which resulted in a range of implied values per share of Sanderson Farms common stock of
$170 to $215, rounded to the nearest $1.00. Centerview then compared the results of the above analysis to the Merger Consideration of $203 per share of
Sanderson Farms common stock in cash, without interest, to be paid to the holders of Sanderson Farms common stock (other than Excluded Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Other Factors
Centerview noted for the Board of Directors certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other things, the
following:
•
Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of the shares of Sanderson Farms common
stock during the 52-week period ended June 18, 2021 (the last trading day before the Wall Street Journal reported on June 21, 2021 that the
Company was exploring a sale), which reflected low and high closing prices for the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock during such
period of $110 and $175 per share.
•
Analyst Price Target Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock in publicly
available Wall Street research analyst reports as of June 18, 2021 (the last trading day before the Wall Street Journal reported on June 21,
2021 that the Company was exploring a sale), which indicated low and high stock price targets for the shares of Sanderson Farms common
stock ranging from $157 per share to $195 per share.
General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or
analysis that it considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of the analyses.
Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors in its evaluation of
the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board of Directors or
management of the Company with respect to the Merger Consideration or as to whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to determine that
a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the Transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and
Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors. Centerview provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Centerview did not,
however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or the Board of Directors or recommend that any specific amount of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transaction.
Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory
and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion Centerview provided general financial advisory services to the
Company, and Centerview
-45-
Table of Contents
received approximately $1,500,000 in compensation from the Company during such period. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion,
Centerview was not engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Parent, Merger Sub, Wayne Farms or Cargill, an affiliate of Parent, and
Centerview did not receive any compensation from Parent, Merger Sub, Wayne Farms or Cargill during such period. In the two years prior to the date of
its written opinion, Centerview was engaged to provide financial advisory or other services unrelated to the Company to CGC, the indirect majority owner
of Wayne Farms, in connection with certain internal matters, and Centerview received less than $1,000,000 in compensation from CGC for such services.
Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company, Parent, Wayne Farms, Cargill, CGC or their respective
affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview and its affiliates’ directors, officers, members and
employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in
which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and
other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, Parent, Wayne Farms,
Cargill, CGC or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.
The Board of Directors selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on Centerview’s reputation and
experience and the Board of Director’s longstanding working relationship with certain principals at Centerview. Centerview is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Transaction.
In connection with Centerview’s services as the financial advisor to the Board of Directors, the Company has agreed to pay Centerview an
aggregate fee of $50,000,000, $5,000,000 of which was payable upon the rendering of Centerview’s opinion and the remainder of which is payable
contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s expenses arising, and to
indemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview’s engagement.

Except for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary course earnings
announcements, Sanderson Farms does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other
results due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer term periods. However,
Sanderson Farms is including a summary of certain previously nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information prepared by its management for the
fiscal years ending October 31, 2021 through October 31, 2025 (the “Management Projections”) in order to provide Sanderson Farms Stockholders with
access to information that was made available to, and approved by, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger
Consideration. Selected line items from the Management Projections for fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2022 were also made
available to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with their due diligence review, and the Management Projections were made available to Centerview in
connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Board of Directors.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated in the
Management Projections as net sales, less cost of sales, less selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”), plus depreciation and
amortization (“D&A”).

(2)
Net operating profit after tax (“NOPAT”) is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated in the Management Projections as (i) EBITDA less
D&A times (ii) one minus the tax rate which was assumed to be 24% for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and 24.5% for subsequent fiscal
years.
(3)
“Unlevered Free Cash Flow” is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated by Centerview in connection with its discounted cash flow
analysis, using the financial information provided by Sanderson Farms in the Management Projections, as NOPAT (as shown in the table above)
plus (i) D&A, less (ii) capital expenditures, less (iii) the increase in net working capital.
Important Information Regarding the Management Projections
The Management Projections were developed by Sanderson Farms management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although
the Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Sanderson
Farms management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future
events, as well as matters specific to Sanderson Farms’ business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are
beyond Sanderson Farms’ control. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, Sanderson
Farms’ performance, industry performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse
changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in Sanderson
Farms’ reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be
significantly higher or lower than the Management Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information by its nature
becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will be affected by Sanderson Farms’ ability to achieve
strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that
are subject to change and cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such.
The inclusion of the Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Sanderson Farms, Centerview, their respective officers,
directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable
prediction of future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement
should not be regarded as an indication that the Management Projections will be necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made
by Sanderson Farms or any other person regarding the Management Projections or Sanderson Farms’ ultimate performance compared to such
information. The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information
about Sanderson Farms contained in Sanderson Farms’ public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.” In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections,
stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.
The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published
guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. Neither Sanderson Farms’ independent auditor
nor any other independent accountant has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Management Projections, nor have they
expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.

Table of Contents
EBITDA, NOPAT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow contained in the Management Projections summarized above are “non-GAAP financial measures,”
which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the Management
Projections were relied upon by Centerview for purposes of its opinion and by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The
SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP
financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document
such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Centerview for purposes of its opinion
or by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Sanderson Farms has not provided a reconciliation of the
financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used
by Sanderson Farms may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP
financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non- GAAP
financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The summary of such information above is included solely to give stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Board of
Directors, Centerview, Parent and Merger Sub, and is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder to make any investment
decision with respect to the Merger. In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the
date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Sanderson Farms does not intend
to update or otherwise revise the Management Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or
to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.
Interests of Sanderson Farms’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
The directors and executive officers of Sanderson Farms have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of stockholders of Sanderson Farms generally. The members of the Board of Directors were aware of, and considered, these interests, among
other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the stockholders of Sanderson Farms
adopt the Merger Agreement. Sanderson Farms’ stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the Sanderson
Farms Merger proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified within the narrative disclosure and in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms’ Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” below. The Merger will constitute a “change in control” for purposes of the compensation arrangements described below.
For purposes of this disclosure the Sanderson Farms executive officers include:
•
Joe F. Sanderson, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
•
Lampkin Butts, President and Chief Operating Officer
•
Mike Cockrell, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Legal Officer
•
Tim Rigney, Secretary and Controller
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Sanderson Farms common stock is the Merger Consideration of $203.00 per share of Sanderson Farms common stock
in cash, without interest;
-48-
Table of Contents
•
the Merger occurs on December 31, 2021, which is the assumed completion date of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;
and
•
the employment of each executive officer of Sanderson Farms is terminated without cause or for good reason (each, a “qualifying termination”) on
December 31, 2021, immediately following the completion of the Merger.
As a result of these assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by Sanderson Farms’ executive officers and non-employee directors
may differ materially from the amounts set forth in this section. For purposes of the discussion in this section, “single trigger” refers to benefits that arise
solely as a result of the completion of the Merger and “double trigger” refers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the
Merger and either the completion of a subsequent, time-based vesting period or a qualifying termination of employment on or following the Effective
Time.
Treatment of Sanderson Farms Equity Awards
Company Restricted Shares. Each share of Sanderson Farms restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any such shares of Sanderson Farms restricted stock granted to employees on or following August 8, 2021) will be fully vested and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, which will be paid no later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time.
The levels, participants, terms and treatment of any shares of Sanderson Farms restricted stock granted to employees on or following August 8, 2021 will
be agreed between Sanderson Farms and Parent.
Company Performance Share Awards for Individuals Other Than Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell. For each performance share award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including those held by Mr. Rigney):
•
each share of Sanderson Farms common stock covered by the award that is earned based on actual performance through October 31, 2021
(prorated according to the number of days elapsed during the applicable performance period as of the Effective Time) will be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, which will be paid within five Business Days following the Effective Time, and
•
the excess of the maximum number of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock covered by the award over the earned shares of Sanderson
Farms common stock covered by the award that is earned based on actual performance through October 31, 2021 (prorated according to the
number of days elapsed during the applicable performance period as of the Effective Time) will convert into an unvested cash award that
will vest on the first anniversary of the closing date or upon an earlier qualifying termination of employment and be paid within five
Business Days following the vesting date (but no later than the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger), subject to continued
employment through such vesting date.
Company Performance Share Awards for Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding
performance share award held by each of Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell will vest and be earned at the maximum level of performance, meaning
200% of the target number of shares covered by the awards (such maximum number of shares is equal to 76,500, 21,000 and 16,500, respectively), and each
earned share will be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, which amount will be payable no later than
the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time.
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms’ Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of unvested equity awards held by Sanderson Farms’ named executive officers.

Severance
Executive Employment Agreements
Sanderson Farms entered into an employment agreement with each of Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell in 2009. The agreements were
superseded by new agreements in 2015, and the new agreements were amended on August 8, 2021 in connection with the Merger. The agreements
provide for a lump sum severance payment to be paid to such officer if, (i) before a change in control of Sanderson Farms, such officer is terminated
without “cause,” except in the case of poor performance; or (ii) at or after a change in control, such officer is terminated without “cause”; or (iii) such
officer resigns for “good reason” (each, a “qualifying termination”).
The employment agreements provide for the following severance in the event of a qualifying termination:
•
in the case of Mr. Sanderson, three times, and in the case of Messrs. Butts and Cockrell, two times the sum of (i) the officer’s annual
base salary for fiscal year 2021, plus (ii) 50% of the maximum bonus available to the officer under the Sanderson Farms bonus program
in effect for fiscal year 2021 (the “Bonus Amount”);
•
a pro-rata bonus for the year in which employment termination occurs equal to the Bonus Amount, prorated based on the number of
days elapsed from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the officer’s employment terminates; and
•
the continuation of medical benefits that the officer would otherwise be eligible to receive for 24 months or, if earlier, until the time the
officer becomes eligible for substantially similar benefits from a subsequent employer.
The severance payments are payable in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the officer’s qualifying termination. Each employment
agreement includes a (i) confidentiality and mutual non-disparagement covenant in perpetuity, (ii) two-year post-termination non-compete and (iii) two-
year post-termination non-solicitation of customers and employees. The severance payments are conditioned upon the officer signing (and not revoking)
a release of claims in favor of Sanderson Farms and complying with applicable restrictive covenants.
Sanderson Farms Severance Plan
On August 8, 2021, Sanderson Farms adopted a severance plan that will take effect upon a change of control of Sanderson Farms, including
completion of the Merger. Under the plan, each regular, full-time salaried employee of Sanderson Farms as of the date immediately preceding a change in
control (excluding any employees who are (i) classified as temporary or seasonal employees or (ii) covered by another plan, employment agreement or
arrangement that provides service benefits upon or in connection with a change of control (which includes Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell)),
including Mr. Rigney, will be entitled to a lump sum payment upon a qualifying termination of employment, with such payment based on the employee’s
years of service with Sanderson Farms. A qualifying termination for purposes of the severance plan means a termination of employment that occurs upon
a change of control or during the nine months following the change in control, in each case, either by Sanderson Farms without “cause” or by the
employee for “good reason.”
Upon a qualifying termination, eligible employees (including Mr. Rigney) will be entitled to a lump sum severance payment consisting of two weeks
of salary for each completed and partial year of service with Sanderson Farms, with a minimum of 13 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks. An employee will
not be entitled to receive any such severance payment unless the employee has signed and not revoked a release of claims in favor of Sanderson Farms.
Quantification of Severance
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms’ Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of severance payments in the event of a qualifying termination.

Table of Contents
Fiscal Year 2022 Cash Bonuses
If the Effective Time occurs on or after November 1, 2021, Sanderson Farms employees employed as of the Effective Time shall receive fiscal year
2022 bonuses calculated at the target performance level and pro-rated for the portion of the fiscal year that has elapsed through the later of the Effective
Time and April 1, 2022. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms’
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” for the estimated value of 2022 annual cash bonus payments to the named executive officers.
Transaction Bonus
Mr. Rigney is eligible to receive a cash transaction bonus conditioned upon the successful completion of the Merger. The aggregate amount of Mr.
Rigney’s bonus is equal to $174,972. Fifty percent of the bonus will vest and be payable immediately before the Effective Time, and the remaining 50% will
vest and be payable upon the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, in each case, subject to Mr. Rigney’s continued employment through the
applicable vesting date; provided that, in the event Mr. Rigney experiences a qualifying termination prior to the first-year anniversary of the Effective
Time, the unvested portion of the transaction bonus will vest and become payable upon the date of such qualifying termination.
Other New Employment and Compensation Arrangements After the Merger
Any executive officers who are retained to provide services to the combined company may enter into new individualized compensation
arrangements and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by the combined company. As of the date of this proxy
statement, no new individualized compensation arrangements for such persons have been established.
Indemnification and Insurance
Under the Merger Agreement, certain indemnification and insurance rights exist in favor of Sanderson Farms’ current and former directors and
officers, and certain current and former employees. See “Proposal 1: Approval of the Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance” for
information about these rights.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms’ Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of
information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Sanderson Farms that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. This
compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of
the stockholders of Sanderson Farms.
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Sanderson Farms common stock is the Merger Consideration of $203 per share of Sanderson Farms common stock in
cash, without interest;
•
the Merger occurs on December 31, 2021, which is the assumed completion date of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;
and
•
each executive officer of Sanderson Farms experiences a qualifying termination on December 31, 2021 immediately following the completion of the
Merger.

Table of Contents
As a result of these assumptions and the assumptions included in the footnotes below, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by Sanderson
Farms’ named executive officers may differ materially from the amounts set forth in the table below. The amounts below do not reflect certain
compensation actions that may occur after the date hereof and before completion of the Merger. The calculations in the table below do not include
amounts the Sanderson Farms named executive officers were already entitled to receive or vested in as of the date hereof. In addition, these amounts do
not attempt to forecast any additional equity or cash award grants, issuances or forfeitures that may occur, prior to the Effective Time, except as
discussed in the narrative above.

Cash. Consists of a prorated fiscal year 2022 cash bonus payable on a single-trigger basis and (1) for Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell, a
cash severance payment under their respective executive employment agreements and (2) for Mr. Rigney, a cash severance payment under the
Sanderson Farms severance plan and a cash transaction bonus. For each officer, severance payments are payable in a lump sum and become
payable only upon a qualifying termination (i.e., double trigger) under the executive employment agreements or severance plan, as applicable, on or
following the completion of the Merger (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Severance”). Half of the transaction bonus payable to
Mr. Rigney, or $87,486, is a “single-trigger” payment and the other half is a “double-trigger” payment (see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “—Management Transaction Bonus”). Each employment agreement provides that the receipt of the severance thereunder is subject to
compliance with a (i) confidentiality and mutual non-disparagement covenant in perpetuity, (ii) two-year post-termination non-compete and (iii) two-
year post-termination non-solicitation of customers and employees. The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following table:

Equity. Amounts shown reflect the estimated value to be received by the Sanderson Farms named executive officers in respect of unvested
Sanderson Farms restricted share awards and unvested Sanderson Farms performance share awards upon a qualifying termination of employment
(as more fully described under “—Treatment of Sanderson Farms Equity Awards”). The estimated value of each such award is shown in the
following table. Values shown reflect intrinsic value as of the assumed Effective Time of December 31, 2021 based on the assumed price per share of
Sanderson Farms common stock of $203.00. The restricted share awards of each named executive officer and the performance share awards of
Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell vest on a “single trigger” basis. Of Mr. Rigney’s performance share awards, based on fiscal 2021 financial
projections, approximately $430,360 will vest on a “single trigger” basis and $412,090 will vest on a “double trigger” basis.

Interests of Sanderson Farms’ Directors in Connection with the Merger
The value of the restricted share awards held by non-employee directors that will vest upon completion of the Merger on December 31, 2021 is
$6,148,464.
Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger (including the funds to pay the Sanderson Farms Stockholders the amounts due
to them under the Merger Agreement), would be approximately $4.53 billion, which will be funded through a combination of the following:
•
debt financing commitments made to Borrower by the debt financing sources under the debt commitment letter in the aggregate of up to
$2,500 million, consisting of a $1,000 million senior secured term loan A-1 facility, a $750 million senior secured term loan A-2 facility, and a
$750 million senior secured term loan B facility; additionally a $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility shall be available for the
Borrower on or after the closing of the Merger; and
•
an equity financing commitment made to Parent by CMSC under the Investment Agreement.
Debt Financing
In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, the Borrower has obtained a debt commitment letter from Bank of America, N.A., BofA
Securities, Inc. and Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. to provide debt financing upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment
letter in the aggregate amount of up to $3,250 million, consisting of a $1,000 million senior secured term loan A-1 facility, a $750 million senior secured term
loan A-2 facility, a $750 million senior secured term loan B facility and a $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility (collectively, the “debt
facilities”; the financing available under the debt facilities, the “debt financing”). It is expected that $2,500 million of the debt financing will be needed at
the closing of the Merger, consisting of the senior secured term loan A-1, senior secured term loan A-2 and senior secured term loan B facilities. The $750
million senior secured revolving credit facility is not expected to be drawn down at the closing of the Merger but shall be available to the Borrower on and
after the closing of the Merger.
The proceeds of the debt financing will be used (i) to finance the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on the
closing date, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement on the closing date, (ii) to repay
indebtedness of the Company under its existing credit facilities (the “Closing Refinancing”), (iii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection
therewith and (iv) subject to a maximum amount to be agreed, to fund working capital and general corporate purposes (including to finance any closing
date working capital needs of the Company or its subsidiaries on the closing date). The aggregate principal amount of the debt financing may be
increased to fund certain original issue discount or upfront fees in connection with the debt financing.
The obligations of the financing sources under the debt commitment letter to provide the debt financing are subject to a number of limited
conditions that are customary for acquisition financing of this type, including, among other things, (i) since August 8, 2021, there shall not have been any
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Approval of the Merger Agreement—
Representations and Warranties”), (ii) the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any
amendments, waivers or consents thereof or thereto that are adverse to the interests of the lenders in any material respect without the consent of the lead
arrangers), (iii) the
-53-
Table of Contents
consummation of the equity financing and Wayne Farms contribution, (iv) the consummation of the Closing Refinancing, (v) the delivery of certain
audited, unaudited and pro forma financial statements, (vi) the taking of certain limited actions necessary to establish and perfect a security interest in the
applicable collateral, subject to certain exceptions, (vii) the receipt of documentation and other information required under applicable “know your
customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including the PATRIOT Act), (viii) the execution and delivery by the borrower and
guarantors of definitive documentation with respect to the applicable debt facilities consistent with the debt commitment letter, (ix) the delivery of certain
customary closing documents (including a customary solvency certificate), (x) the accuracy of certain limited representations and warranties and (xi) the
payment of applicable invoiced fees and expenses. In addition, the financing sources are not obligated to fund the debt financing prior to September 30,
2021.
The obligations of the debt financing sources under the debt commitment letter to provide the debt financing will terminate at 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on May 13, 2022 (or if the End Date under the Merger Agreement is automatically extended in accordance with the terms and conditions
thereof, August 15, 2022) or such earlier date on which either the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the
consummation of the Merger) or the Merger is consummated without the use of such debt financing.
If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the above mentioned debt commitment
letter and the fee letters related thereto, Parent has agreed under the Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources, (i) on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent than those contemplated in the debt commitment letter (taking into account any “market flex” terms) and (ii) in an
amount, together with other portions of the financing that remain available to Parent and Merger Sub, sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses; provided that Parent has no obligation to obtain debt financing on terms
materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent than the terms (taken as a whole) contained in the original debt commitment letter (including any
“market flex” provisions applicable thereto).
As of the last practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the debt commitment letter is in effect, and Parent has not notified us of
any plans to utilize alternative financing. The documentation governing the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter has not been
finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the debt financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.
Equity Financing
Parent is party to that certain Investment Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2021, entered into by and among Holdings, CMSC, Parent and for the
purposes of Section 2.1, Section 7.4(f) and Section 11.19 thereof only, each of CGC and Cargill (the “Investment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Investment
Agreement, CMSC has committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement, to make an equity contribution to
Parent in an aggregate amount, which together with the amounts received pursuant to the debt financing set forth above, will be sufficient to fund all
amounts required to be paid or deposited by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement and for paying all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent
pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “equity financing”), and Holdings has committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Investment Agreement, to contribute all of the equity of Wayne Farms to Parent.
Funding of the equity financing is subject to the conditions provided in the Investment Agreement, which include: (i) the conditions to the closing
of the Merger under the Merger Agreement having been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at such closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at such closing) and each of Holdings and CMSC having reasonable assurance that the debt
financing shall be disbursed and the closing of the Merger shall take place substantially concurrently with, or on the same Business Day (which is
similarly defined in the Investment Agreement as defined in this proxy statement) as, the closing of the equity financing, (ii) no law or order issued by any
court of competent
-54-
Table of Contents
jurisdiction or other governmental authority preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement shall be in
effect, (iii) the representations and warranties of Holdings being true and correct at the closing (except where the failure to be true and correct would not
have a Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect) and (iv) there having been no Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect (subject to certain customary
exclusions).
The obligations of CMSC to fund the equity financing and of Holdings to make the Wayne Farms contribution will terminate automatically and
immediately upon the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. The Investment Agreement may also be terminated by Holdings
or CMSC if any governmental authority has issued an order, decree or ruling permanently restraining or prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the
Investment Agreement, and such order, decree or ruling has become final and nonappealable (so long as a breach by the party seeking to terminate was
not the proximate cause of such judgment, order, decree or ruling).",54,63

The closing of the Merger will take place (a) at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions
to closing of the Merger (as described under the section of this proxy statement entitled, “Proposal 1: Approval of the Merger Agreement – Conditions

of the Merger may not occur before September 30, 2021 without the prior written consent of Parent.
Litigation Related to the Merger
On September 10, 2021, the O’Dell Lawsuit was filed against Sanderson Farms and its Board of Directors. The O’Dell Lawsuit generally alleges that
this proxy statement, originally filed on September 3, 2021 in connection with the Merger, omits material information in violation of Section 14(a) and 20(a)
of the Exchange Act, rendering this proxy statement materially incomplete and misleading. The O’Dell Lawsuit seeks, among other things, injunctive relief
to prevent the consummation of the Merger, or alternatively, rescission or rescissory damages in the event the Merger is consummated, damages, costs
and disbursements, including attorneys’ fees, and such other and further equitable relief as the court may deem just and proper.",63,63
SANDERSON FARMS INC_20210913_DEFM14A_19528141_4293580.Pdf,No Appraisal Rights,"No Appraisal Rights
The MBCA includes what is often referred to as the “market exception” to appraisal rights in the event of a merger involving shares traded in a
liquid market. In particular, MBCA § 79-4-13.02(b)(2) provides as follows:
(2) Appraisal rights shall not be available for the holders of shares of any class or series of shares which is:
(i)
Listed on the New York Stock Exchange or designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or
(ii)
Not so listed or designated, but has at least two thousand (2,000) shareholders and the outstanding shares of such class or series has
a market value of at least twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) (exclusive of the value of such shares held by its subsidiaries, senior
executives, directors and beneficial shareholders owning more than ten percent (10%) of such shares).
The applicability of this exception is determined as of the Record Date fixed to determine the Sanderson Farms Stockholders entitled to receive
notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting.
Shares of Sanderson Farms common stock are listed for trading on NASDAQ. Further, on the Record Date Sanderson Farms had 2,552
stockholders, and the market value of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock,
-55-Table of Contents
exclusive of the value of such shares held by its subsidiaries, senior executives, directors, and beneficial stockholders owning more than ten percent
(10%) of such shares exceeded twenty million dollars ($20,000,000). Thus, the Sanderson Farms common stock meets the threshold requirement for
appraisal rights not to be available because of the market exception.
Even though the Sanderson Farms common stock meets this threshold requirement, the MBCA provides two potential circumstances, neither of
which is applicable here, that could nevertheless result in appraisal rights being available. First, appraisal rights would be available if the Sanderson
Farms Stockholders were required to accept in the Merger anything other than cash or certain marketable securities. Since the Sanderson Farms
Stockholders will only receive cash in the Merger, this provision of the MBCA is not applicable. Second, the MBCA provides that appraisal rights would
be available if the Merger is an “interested transaction,” as defined in the statute. An interested transaction would include a transaction in which a senior
executive or director of the corporation will receive, as a result of the Merger, a financial benefit not generally available to other stockholders as such,
other than (1) employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established separately, and not as a part of, or in contemplation of, the Merger, or (2)
employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established in contemplation of or as part of the Merger that are not more favorable than those
existing before the Merger, or, if more favorable, that had been approved on behalf of the corporation by certain disinterested directors. As is discussed
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Sanderson Farms in the Merger,” the senior
executives will receive, as a result of the Merger, certain employment-related benefits established in contemplation of or as a part of the Merger. These
were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of disinterested directors and which otherwise meets the
requirements for approval of the employment-related benefits of the senior executives for the Merger not to be an interested transaction. The Merger
does not meet any other definition of the statute that would cause it to be an interested transaction. Accordingly, the Merger qualifies for the market
exception, and appraisal rights are not available to the Sanderson Farms Stockholders in connection with the Merger.

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders
and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to Sanderson Farms Stockholders who hold their shares of Sanderson Farms common stock as “capital
assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally, property held for investment
purposes). This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any
matter discussed below.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to Sanderson Farms Stockholders subject
to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, but not limited to:

•
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
Partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations,” or any other pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities);
•
expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code;

persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

except as noted below, holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Sanderson Farms common
stock (by vote or by value);
•

This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other
non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any
considerations arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or

income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership
and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of Sanderson Farms common stock should
consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR STOCKHOLDER
WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH
RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.
U.S. Holders
This section applies to “U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a Beneficial Owner of shares of Sanderson Farms
common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust
validly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Sanderson Farms common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock. A U.S.
Holder’s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of
the Merger. A preferential tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Sanderson Farms common stock (shares of Sanderson
Farms common stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules
apply to them.
Non-U.S. Holders
This section applies to “Non-U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a Beneficial Owner of Sanderson Farms
common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in
respect of gain recognized in connection with the Merger, unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States);
-58-
Table of Contents
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition of shares of
Sanderson Farms common stock pursuant to the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met; or
•
shares of Sanderson Farms common stock constitute a United States real property interest (a “USRPI”) by reason of the Company’s status
as a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “USRPHC”) at any time during the shorter of
the five-year period preceding the effective date of the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable
shares of Sanderson Farms common stock (the “Relevant Period”).
Unless an applicable treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to tax at generally applicable
U.S. federal income tax rates as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. resident. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its “effectively
connected earnings and profits” for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.
Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by
an applicable income tax treaty), which generally may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder, provided the Non-U.S. Holder has
timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
With respect to the third bullet above, we believe that the Company is not currently, and has not been during the Relevant Period, a USRPHC. Even
if we are or were a USRPHC, gain arising from a Non-U.S. Holder’s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Sanderson Farms common stock pursuant to
the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the Sanderson Farms common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined in the applicable Treasury
Regulations, on an established securities market, and such Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of the Sanderson Farms
common stock throughout the Relevant Period.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. Holders in connection with
the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless
the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct
taxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise
complies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding of tax may also apply to the proceeds received by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the
Merger, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such Non-U.S. Holder’s status as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable
certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder generally
will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH THEREIN.

Sanderson Farms, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use all reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date of the Merger Agreement and in any event prior to the End Date. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Approval of the
Merger Agreement—Efforts to Complete the Merger.”
Under the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until notifications have
been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the Federal Trade
Commission (the “FTC”) and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Sanderson Farms and Parent are required to file all necessary notification and report
forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the transaction
contemplated by the Investment Agreement) no later than 90 calendar days following the date of the Merger Agreement. However, (i) if Sanderson Farms
and Parent have not filed the required notification and report forms under the HSR Act by the 30th calendar day from the date of the Merger Agreement,
Sanderson Farms and Parent will consult with one another in good faith to mutually determine whether to accelerate the filing of the required notification
and report forms under the HSR Act and (ii) if at any point prior to Sanderson Farms and Parent filing the required notification and report forms under the
HSR Act, Parent determines in good faith that it would be necessary, proper or advisable to accelerate such filing in order to obtain the expiration of the
waiting period under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable, Parent will notify Sanderson Farms thereof in writing, and Parent and Sanderson Farms will
file the required notification and report forms under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable thereafter.
The Merger is also subject to clearance or approval by the antitrust authorities in Mexico and China. Sanderson Farms and Parent made the initial
submissions for the filings in Mexico and China on September 7, 2021.
At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action
under the applicable antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally permit completion
of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take
action under applicable antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not impose
conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the transaction. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under
antitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither Parent nor Sanderson Farms believe that the Merger will violate the antitrust laws, there can
be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by materiality qualifications or a “Company Material Adverse
Effect” or “Parent Material Adverse Effect” qualification, as discussed below.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Company Material Adverse Effect” means an event, change, occurrence, effect or development that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations, or financial
condition of Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. However, a Company Material Adverse Effect will not include events, changes,
occurrences, effects or developments relating to or resulting from:
•
any change in the market price or trading volume of Sanderson Farms common stock (provided that the underlying causes of such change
may be deemed to contribute to a Company Material Adverse Effect);
•
the execution, announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement (including the identity of Parent, Merger Sub or Wayne Farms); the
taking of any action required or expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of Sanderson Farms with employees,
labor unions, works councils, financing sources, customers, franchisees, suppliers, partners, governmental entities or other business
relationship (subject to certain exceptions);
•
the general conditions or trends in the industries in which Sanderson Farms operates or in the economy generally or other general business,
financial or market conditions, including competition in geographic, product or service areas;
•
domestic, foreign or global political conditions, economic, regulatory, financial or capital markets conditions (including interest rates,
exchange rates, tariffs, trade wars and credit markets);

any act of civil unrest, civil disobedience, protests, public demonstrations, insurrection, terrorism, war, cyberterrorism, ransomware or
malware, military activity, sabotage or cybercrime, national or international calamity or any other similar event;
•
any natural or manmade disasters, epidemics, pandemics or disease outbreaks (including COVID-19) or any acts of God;
•
the failure of Sanderson Farms to meet internal or analysts’ expectations or projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates or budgets (provided
that the underlying causes of such change may be deemed to contribute to a Company Material Adverse Effect);
-65-
Table of Contents
•
any action or proceeding based on allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty or violation of applicable law relating to or resulting from the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby;
•
any action taken by Sanderson Farms at the written direction of Parent or any action required or expressly permitted by specific provisions
of the Merger Agreement to be taken by Parent, Merger Sub, Wayne Farms or Sanderson Farms pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, or the failure of Sanderson Farms to take any action that Sanderson Farms is prohibited by the terms of the Merger Agreement
from taking (subject to certain exceptions);
•
any breach by Parent, Merger Sub or Wayne Farms of the Merger Agreement;
•
any matter expressly set forth on Sanderson Farms’ disclosure schedules delivered in connection with the Merger Agreement as qualifying
Sanderson Farms’ representation regarding the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect since April 30, 2021, or any matter that is
reasonably apparent on its face as qualifying such representation; or
•
any change in any applicable law (including as it may relate to COVID-19 or cyberterrorism, ransomware or malware) or GAAP.
However, to the extent such events, circumstances, conditions, changes, developments or effects in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and twelfth bullet
points above has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a disproportionate adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to others in the industry or industries in
which the Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries operate, only the incremental disproportionate impact will be taken into account when determining
whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Parent Material Adverse Effect” means any event, change, occurrence, effect or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, prevents or materially delays or materially impairs the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under the
Merger Agreement or to consummate the Merger.

Alternative Proposal Definition
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, an “Alternative Proposal” means any bona fide indication of interest, proposal or offer made by any person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or its affiliates) related to, for or that would result in, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions:

Farms;
•
the direct or indirect acquisition by any person of (i) more than 15% of the assets of Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries on a consolidated

Existing Discussions or Negotiations
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Sanderson Farms has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and directors

confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which Sanderson Farms or any of its subsidiaries entered into with the intent of exploring a potential
Alternative Proposal, except that Sanderson Farms may grant waivers of standstill or similar provision to the extent the Board of Directors has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
Receipt of Alternative Proposals
Sanderson Farms must promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) notify Parent in writing of (i) the receipt by Sanderson Farms, any of
its subsidiaries or any of their representatives of an Alternative Proposal, (ii) any proposal or offer received by Sanderson Farms, any of its subsidiaries
or any of their representatives with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal or (iii) any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with Sanderson Farms, its subsidiaries or its affiliates or any of their respective
representatives concerning an Alternative Proposal. Sanderson Farms’ notice to Parent must include (i) a copy of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or
proposal made in writing (including any draft agreements or term sheets, financing commitments and other agreements submitted therewith) and (ii) a

Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and terms of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal and (iii) provide Parent
promptly after the receipt or delivery of copies of all written proposals, offers or draft agreements sent or provided to Sanderson Farms, its affiliates or its
representatives from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, inquiry, offer or proposal.
Notwithstanding the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if
Sanderson Farms receives an Alternative Proposal that did not result from a breach of the provisions of the Merger Agreement described above in “—No
Solicitation Obligations” that the Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below), Sanderson Farms may:
•
furnish non-public information to the third party making the Alternative Proposal, as well as its representatives and potential financing
sources, if, and only if, prior to doing so, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with Sanderson Farms having
confidentiality provisions and other terms that are not less favorable in any material respect to Sanderson Farms than Sanderson’s Farms
confidentiality agreements with certain affiliates of Parent, subject to the requirement that any such non-public information be provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information is furnished to such third party; and
•
engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal.
Superior Proposal Definition
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, unsolicited written Alternative Proposal that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with Sanderson Farms’ outside financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of
Directors considers to be appropriate to be more favorable to Sanderson Farms and its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed; provided, that, for purposes of the definition of Superior
Proposal, the references to “15%” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be references to “50%.”

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the holders of shares
of Sanderson Farms common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of
Directors will not effect a Change of Recommendation, except as described below.
Restrictions on Change of Recommendation
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors may not:
•
withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub) the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the Sanderson Farms stockholders approve the Merger
Agreement (the “Company Recommendation”);
•
approve or recommend to the Sanderson Farms stockholders or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the Sanderson Farms
stockholders any Alternative Proposal;
•
fail to include the Company Recommendation in this proxy statement;
•
fail to reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation within five Business Days of a written request to do so from Parent following the
public disclosure of an Alternative Proposal (other than of the type referred to immediately below), except that such request may be made
by Parent only once with respect to each Alternative Proposal and each amended Alternative Proposal; or
•
fail to publish, send or provide to the holders of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange
Act a statement recommending against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer and publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within 10 Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such
tender offer or exchange offer or fail to maintain such recommendation against such offer at any time before such offer has expired or been
withdrawn.
The actions described in the bullet points above are referred to in this proxy statement as a “Change of Recommendation.” Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, Sanderson Farms or the Board of Directors may (i) disclose to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or issue a “stop, look and listen”
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) make any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with Sanderson Farms’ outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Sanderson Farms Stockholders under applicable law; provided, that
any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Change of Recommendation may only be made in accordance with the provisions of the Merger
Agreement described in this section of this proxy statement and the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Change of Recommendation in
Connection with Intervening Event.”
Change of Recommendation or Termination in Connection with Superior Proposal
Before the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Board of Directors may, in response to a Superior Proposal received by Sanderson
Farms after the date of the Merger Agreement on an unsolicited basis, (i) make a Change of Recommendation or (ii) cause Sanderson Farms to terminate
the Merger Agreement prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal
substantially concurrently with such termination, subject to the payment of the Company Termination Fee (see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “—Company Termination Fee”); provided that, in each case:
•
the Board of Directors shall have first determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
the Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;
-71-Table of Contents
•
Sanderson Farms must have given Parent at least four Business Days’ written notice (a “Superior Proposal Written Notice”) advising Parent
of such determination and its intention to make a Change of Recommendation or to terminate the Merger Agreement, which Superior
Proposal Written Notice shall include a description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for the
proposed action of the Board of Directors, the identity of the person making the Superior Proposal, together with a copy of any written offer
or proposal, proposed definitive agreement, proposed or committed financing documentation and any other related documents for such
Superior Proposal;
•
during such four Business Day period, if requested by Parent, Sanderson Farms, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives must
engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its representatives to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a
manner so that such Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and
•
at the end of such four Business Day period, after taking into account any proposals made by Parent to amend the terms of the Merger
Agreement during the period following delivery of the Superior Proposal Written Notice, the Board of Directors concludes in good faith
after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Written Notice
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, subject to the commencement of a new notice period of two Business Days upon any material
modifications to the terms of the Superior Proposal (including any change in the form or amount of consideration).
Change of Recommendation in Connection with Intervening Event
In addition, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event (as defined
below), make a Change of Recommendation contemplated by the first or third bullet in the definition of Change of Recommendation summarized above if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Sanderson Farms’ outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to the following requirements:
•
Sanderson Farms must have given Parent at least four Business Days’ written notice (an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent of its
intention to make a Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice must include a description of the applicable Intervening
Event;
•
during such four Business Day period, if requested by Parent, Sanderson Farms, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives must
engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its representatives to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a
manner that would permit the Board of Directors, consistent with its fiduciary duties, not to make such Change of Recommendation; and
•
at the end of such notice period, after taking into account any proposals made by Parent to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement
during the period following delivery of the Intervening Event Notice, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
Sanderson Farms’ outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change of Recommendation would continue
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Under the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development that is material to Sanderson Farms
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole that is (i) unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger
Agreement, or if known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement, the material consequences of
which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) does not involve or relate to

In the event that any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor Parent will:
•
use its reasonable best efforts as promptly as practicable to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with the cash contribution under the Investment Agreement and the available portion of the debt financing to consummate

Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for Sanderson Farms
and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing
coverage and having other terms not less favorable in the aggregate to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors

except that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual
premium most recently paid by Sanderson Farms and its subsidiaries (the “Maximum Amount”).
If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by the paragraph directly above because its cost exceeds the Maximum
Amount, it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.
In lieu of such insurance, prior to the date of the closing of the Merger, Sanderson Farms may, at its option, purchase a six-year prepaid “tail” directors’

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Sanderson Farms is required to submit a proposal to our
stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Sanderson Farms’ named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This
compensation is summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Sanderson
Farms in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information
disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, Sanderson Farms is asking you to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Sanderson Farms approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will or may become
payable to Sanderson Farms’ named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Sanderson Farms in the
Merger.”
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice
versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Sanderson Farms. Accordingly, if the Merger
Agreement is adopted and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the
outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.

Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter to exceed the votes cast of the shares of
Sanderson Farms common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter opposing

of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a
sufficient number of votes against approval of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change
their votes to votes in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or
otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting. Under the Merger Agreement, our right to adjourn the Special Meeting is subject to

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.
(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any
securities of the Company or Merger Sub:
(i) Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively,
the “Common Stock,” and each, a “Share”) that is outstanding
A-2
Table of Contents
immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares and Shares covered by Company Restricted Share
Awards, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $203.00 per Share in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). All
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically
cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.
(ii) Cancellation of Shares. Each Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise, or by Parent or Merger Sub, or
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
(iii) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(b) Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the MBCA (but only to the extent
required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 79-4-13.01, et seq., of the MBCA with respect to any such
Shares held by any such holder (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 79-4-
13.01, et seq., unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the MBCA. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as
if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 79-4-13.01, et seq., of the MBCA and as provided in the previous
sentence. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares and (ii) the
reasonable opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with prior written consent of the Company, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer to settle or compromise any such demands or waive any failure to
timely deliver a written notice for appraisal or otherwise to comply with Section 79-4-13.01, et seq., of the MBCA.
(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares of the Company shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that
shall be appointed by Parent (and reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by the Company
in writing (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), payable
upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares (“Certificates”) (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or noncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually reasonably agree), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.
(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holder’s
properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender
of the Certificate may be paid to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.
(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any
other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and
instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
2.
A-4
Table of Contents
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares on the one (1)-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter be delivered to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Article 2 shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Shares.
(e) No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;
provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government; provided, further, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 2, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares of the Company. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d).
(g) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.
Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.
(a) Company Restricted Share Awards. Each award of Shares granted by the Company prior to the date hereof, or granted by the Company
after the date hereof in accordance with Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter to a non-employee director of the Company, that in either case is
subject to any time-based vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions (but not performance-based vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions) (each,

accordance with Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the “Company Restricted Share Awards”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall, at the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of Shares covered by such Accelerated Company Restricted Share Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay to the holders of
Company Restricted Share Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld
or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, promptly following the
Effective Time but in any event no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time. All Shares covered by the Accelerated Company
Restricted Share Awards that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.3(a) shall be
automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

(i) Each award of Shares granted subject to performance-based vesting with a performance period that commenced on November 1,
2019 (each, a “2019 Company Performance Share Award”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, at the Effective
Time, be converted into:
(A) a fully vested right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the number of Shares
covered by such award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, calculated based on the actual level of performance in accordance with
the terms of such award, with the applicable performance period ending on October 31 2021, by (II) a fraction, the numerator of which is
equal to the number of calendar days elapsed during the applicable performance period (November 1, 2019 through October 31, 2021) as of
the Effective Time and the denominator of which is equal to 730 (the resulting product of (I) and (II), the “2019 Vested Shares”) by (III) the
Merger Consideration; and
(B) an unvested right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the excess of (x) 200% of
the target number of Shares covered by such award over (y) the 2019 Vested Shares by (II) the Merger Consideration, which right shall vest
in full on the earlier of the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date and the date of the holder’s Qualifying Termination, subject to the
holder’s continued employment with the Company or an Affiliate through such earlier date.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay to the former holders of 2019 Company Performance
Share Awards the vested cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, as promptly as practicable
following (x) in the case of the amounts described in clause (A) of such sentence, the Effective Time, but in any event no later than the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the Effective Time, and (y) in the case of the amounts described in clause (B) of such sentence, the applicable vesting date,
but in any event no later than the earlier of (I) the fifth (5th) Business Day following the applicable vesting date and (II) the first (1st) anniversary of
the Closing Date.
(ii) Each award of Shares granted subject to performance-based vesting with a performance period that commenced on November 1,
2020 (each, a “2020 Company Performance Share Award, and, together with the 2019 Company Performance Share Awards, the “Company
Performance Share Awards”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into:
(A) a fully vested right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the number of Shares
covered by such award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, calculated based on the actual level of performance in accordance with

investment agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement (redacted only to omit portions that do not adversely affect the amount, conditionality,
enforceability, termination or availability of the Cash Equity in any respect, or the Company’s third party beneficiary rights provided therein (provided
that the identities of the parties thereto shall not be redacted)), together with all exhibits and schedules thereto applicable to the unredacted portions
thereof (the “Investment Agreement” and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the “Commitment Letters”), pursuant to which Affiliates of the
Equity Investors specified therein have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the cash equity set forth therein or
contribute to Parent the assets set forth therein, as applicable. The cash equity committed pursuant to the Investment Agreement is referred to in this
Agreement as the “Cash Equity.” The Cash Equity and the Debt Financing are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Financing.”
(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Financing
Entities and the Equity Investors to provide the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on
a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have
Knowledge that any of the Debt Financing Entities or the Equity Investors will not perform its obligations thereunder. The Debt Commitment Letter
constitutes the entire and complete agreement of the parties thereto with respect to the Debt Financing, the Investment Agreement constitutes the entire
and complete agreement of the parties thereto with respect to the Cash Equity and, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind (except for the Redacted Fee Letter and except for the redacted
portions of the Investment Agreement, none of which redacted portions adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, termination or
availability of the Financing in any material respect), relating to either Commitment Letter that could materially adversely affect the availability,
enforceability, or conditionality of the Financing or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing below the Merger Amounts at Closing.
(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, will provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s
obligations under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letters, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any payments in respect of
equity compensation obligations to be made in connection with the Merger, payment of any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation, and any repayment of any outstanding indebtedness of Parent, the Company, and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated
by, or required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the Commitment Letters (such amounts, collectively, the “Merger
Amounts”).
(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent
A-22

under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters, and, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the Financing will not
be available to Parent on the date of the Closing. Parent has paid, or caused to be paid, in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement. None of the Commitment Letters has been modified,
amended or altered as of the date hereof and none of the respective commitments under any of the Commitment Letters has been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect as of the date hereof, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated. As of the date hereof, no
modification or amendment to the Commitment Letters is contemplated other than as such modification or amendment may be made in accordance with
Section 5.12 hereof.
(f) Without limiting Section 8.5(b), in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Financing (including any alternative financing thereof)) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement.
Section 4.6 Capitalization of Merger Sub. All of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned by either Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub does not have outstanding any option, warrant, right or
any other agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent or its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries may acquire any equity security
of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incidental to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Investment Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Investment Agreement.
Section 4.7 No Vote of Parent Stockholders. No vote of the members of Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or
otherwise), that has not already been obtained, is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents of Parent or the applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded, in order for Parent to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.
Section 4.8 Finders or Brokers. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) has employed any investment banker,
broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any commission from the
Company prior to Closing in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.
Section 4.9 No Additional Representations. Parent and Merger Sub agree and acknowledge that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article 3, neither the Company nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of
the Company or any of its Affiliates. Parent and Merger Sub agree and acknowledge that in making the decision to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have relied exclusively on the express representations and
warranties contained in Article 3 and have not relied on any other representation or warranty, express or implied. Parent and Merger Sub agree and
acknowledge that neither the Company nor any Person has made, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on, any representation or warranty of the
Company, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries furnished or made
available to Parent and its Representatives (including any information, documents or material made available to Parent in the due diligence materials
provided to Parent, including in the data room, other management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other form in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and including with respect to any business or financial projection, guidance or forecast relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), except as set forth in Article 3 (which includes the Company Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Documents, as

Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, in each case other than those Contracts that have come into existence after the date hereof and have been
provided and consented to by the Company.

any rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, any Shares, except pursuant to this Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their “affiliates” or

conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the Merger, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries will be Solvent.
Section 4.13 Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the guarantees addressed
to the Company from Cedar Guarantor and Conifer Guarantor, respectively, severally guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (each, a “Guarantee”). Each Guarantee is valid and in full force and effect and
constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Cedar Guarantor or Conifer Guarantor, as the case may be, in favor of the Company,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The Cedar Guarantor and the Conifer Guarantor are not in
default or breach under any of the terms or conditions of their respective Guarantees and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition under the terms and conditions of such
Guarantee. The Cedar Guarantor and the Conifer Guarantor each have, or will have at the Closing, access to sufficient capital to satisfy the full amount of
the guaranteed obligations under its Guarantee in full.

regarding or (B) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates) any non-public information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, an Alternative Proposal (except, in each case,
solely to (x) notify such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.5 or (y) to seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions
of any proposal or offer made by any Person solely to determine whether such proposal or offer constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal), (iii) enter into any letter of intent, understanding, agreement in principle or agreement (whether written or oral, binding or non-binding,
preliminary or definitive) providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.5(b)), (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal or (v) take any action to make any provision of
any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation (or any related provision in the Company’s
articles of incorporation or bylaws) inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Alternative Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and directors, and shall instruct each of its other Representatives, to (1) immediately following
the execution of this Agreement cease and cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and Representatives) in connection with any Alternative Proposal, (2) terminate access to any physical or
electronic data rooms hosted by or on behalf of the Company by any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) and (3)
deliver written notice to each such Person requesting that such Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) return or
destroy all confidential information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement between the
Company and such Person. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) notify Parent in writing of (A) the receipt by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives of an Alternative Proposal, (B) any proposal or offer received by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal or (C) any
solicitations, discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives concerning an Alternative Proposal, which notice shall include a copy of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal made in
writing (including any draft agreements or term sheets, financing commitments and other agreements submitted therewith) and (y) a summary of the
material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal not made in writing. In addition, from and after the date hereof, the
Company shall (i) notify Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 5.5(b), (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and terms
(including any material change to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal) of any such Alternative Proposal, offer or proposal and (iii) provide Parent
promptly after the receipt or delivery of copies of all written proposals, offers or draft agreements sent or provided to the Company, its Affiliates or its
Representatives from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, inquiry, offer or proposal.
(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the
Company receives an Alternative Proposal that did not result from a breach of the first sentence of Section 5.5(a) that the Board of Directors determines
in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may
take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Alternative Proposal, as well as its Representatives and
potential financing sources, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the
Company having provisions as to confidential treatment of information and other terms that are not less favorable to the Company in any material respect
than the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit
confidentially making or amending of any
A-30
Table of Contents
Alternative Proposal to the Board of Directors, but such Confidentiality Agreement shall not prohibit the Company from providing any information
contemplated by this Section 5.5 to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives) (provided, that any such nonpublic information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information is furnished to such third
party), and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal. It is understood and agreed that any
contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations to the extent permitted by this Section 5.5(b), including any public announcement that the Company or
the Board of Directors has made any determinations contemplated under this Section 5.5(b) to take or engage in any such actions, shall not constitute a
Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i). From the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, amend, modify or
waive any standstill, non-use or non-disclosure provision with respect to an Alternative Proposal of any confidentiality agreement, standstill or similar
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into with the intent of exploring a potential Alternative Proposal; provided, that the
Company may grant waivers of standstill and similar provisions to the extent the Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.5, the Board of Directors shall not (i) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend to the
Company’s stockholders, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the Company’s stockholders, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to reaffirm
publicly the Recommendation within five (5) Business Days of a request therefor in writing from Parent following the public disclosure of an Alternative
Proposal (other than the type referred to in the following clause (v)) (provided that such a request may be made by Parent only once with respect to each
Alternative Proposal and each amended Alternative Proposal), (iv) fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (v) fail to publish, send
or provide to the holders of Shares, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act a statement recommending against any Alternative Proposal that is
a tender or exchange offer and publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or fail to maintain such recommendation against such offer at any time before such
offer has expired or been withdrawn (any such action, a “Change of Recommendation”). Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, in response to a Superior Proposal received by the
Company after the date of this Agreement on an unsolicited basis, (x) make a Change of Recommendation or (y) cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i) in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal substantially
concurrently with such termination; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation or
cause any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i) (A) unless the Board of Directors shall have first determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and the Company shall
have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ written notice (a “Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of such determination and its intention to
make such a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, which Superior Proposal Notice shall include a description of the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the Board of Directors, the identity of the Person making the Superior
Proposal and a copy of any written offer or proposal, proposed definitive agreement, proposed or committed financing documentation and any other
related documents for such Superior Proposal, if any, (B) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to amend the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner so that such Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (C) at the end of such four (4)
Business Day period, after taking into account any proposals made by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement during the period following delivery
of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Board of Directors concludes in good faith after consultation with outside legal and
A-31
Table of Contents
financial advisors that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, that any
material modifications to the terms of the Superior Proposal (including any change in the form or amount of consideration) shall commence a new notice
period under clause (A) of two (2) Business Days.
(d) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board
of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change of Recommendation contemplated by clauses (i) or (iv) of the definition thereof if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall not be entitled
to make such a Change of Recommendation (i) unless the Company shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ written notice (an
“Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice shall include a
description of the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in such a manner that would permit the Board of Directors, consistent with its fiduciaries duties, not to make such Change of
Recommendation and (iii) unless, at the end of such notice period, after taking into account any proposals made by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement during the period following delivery of such Intervening Event Notice, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change of Recommendation contemplated by clauses (i) or
(iv) of the definition thereof would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking or disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a
“stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such disclosure
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law;
provided, that any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Change of Recommendation may only be made in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Section 5.5(c) and Section 5.5(d). A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act in connection with
a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation.
(f) “Alternative Proposal” means any bona fide indication of interest, proposal or offer made by any Person (other than by Parent, Merger
Sub or its Affiliates) related to, for or that would result in (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of (A) more than fifteen percent (15%) of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or (B) assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries to which more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the revenues or earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are attributable for the most recent fiscal year for
which the audited financial statements are then available, or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of, or a tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in such Person beneficially owning, more fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding Shares or more than fifteen percent (15%)
of the total voting power of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), whether in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions.
(g) “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, unsolicited written Alternative Proposal, substituting in the definition thereof “fifty percent
(50%)” for “fifteen percent (15%)” in each place it appears, that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s
outside financial and legal advisors,
A-32
Table of Contents
and considering such factors as the Board of Directors considers to be appropriate to be more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed.
(h) “Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole that is (i) unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date hereof, or if known and reasonably foreseeable to the
Board of Directors as of the date hereof, the material consequences of which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of
the date hereof and (ii) does not involve or relate to an Alternative Proposal.
Section 5.6 Filings; Other Actions.
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof),
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.5, include the Recommendation, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
receipt thereof and shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders promptly following the time the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company’s stockholders (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of such time). Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such information concerning themselves and their Affiliates as is customarily included in a proxy statement
prepared in connection with a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise required by Law, requested by the SEC or its staff
or as the Company may reasonably request. Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any written comments of the SEC staff with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response and consider in good faith such comments reasonably proposed by
Parent or its counsel for inclusion therein. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (i) correct any information provided by it
specifically for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and (ii)
supplement the information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that shall become necessary in order to
make the statements in the Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company agrees to cause the
Proxy Statement as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law.
(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) take all action, including such actions required by NASDAQ
and SEC rules and as required by the MBCA and its articles of incorporation and bylaws to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders promptly following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining (A) the Company Stockholder
Approval and (B) if so desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of stockholders in
connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Company Meeting”), and (ii) subject to a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.5, use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part to cause the Company Stockholder Approval to be received at the Company Meeting, and shall comply with all legal requirements
applicable to the Company Meeting. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to solicit such
approval following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Company Meeting; provided, that the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent (and
shall, on the reasonable request of Parent), adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting (A) if the Company believes in good faith that such adjournment
or postponement is reasonably necessary to allow reasonable additional time to (1) solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, or
A-33
Table of Contents
(2) distribute any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Board of Directors has determined (which subsequent distribution shall be
made as promptly as practicable) in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law
and for such supplement or amendment to be reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Company Meeting, (B) if the Company reasonably
believes that there will be insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting, or (C) if and to the extent such postponement or adjournment of the Company Meeting is required by applicable Law or on account of
a force majeure event or emergency. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, postpone or
adjourn the Company Meeting pursuant to clause (A)(1) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence for a period of more than ten (10) Business Days
on any single occasion or, on any occasion, to a date after the earlier of (x) forty (40) Business Days after the date on which the Company Meeting was
originally scheduled and (y) ten (10) Business Days before the End Date (it being understood that postponements or adjournments that fall within the
scope of both clause (A)(1) and clause (C) shall be deemed to be covered by clause (A)(1) for purposes of this sentence unless an order of a court or
other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction has specified a requirement for the timing of such adjournment or postponement that conflicts with
this sentence).
Section 5.7 Employee Matters.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor all Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For the period (i) commencing at the Effective Time and ending on March
31, 2022, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (“Company
Employees”) (A) base compensation and cash incentive opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (B) all other compensation and employee benefits (other than severance benefits) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) commencing April 1, 2022 and
ending on the one (1)-year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Company Employee (A) base
compensation and short-term and long-term cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and (B) all other compensation and employee benefits (other than severance benefits) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent; provided, however, that no defined benefit pension, post-retirement welfare,
equity incentive, management stock purchase plan, employee stock ownership plan, retention or change in control benefits provided prior to the Effective
Time or to similarly situated employees of Parent shall be taken into account for purposes of this covenant.
(b) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply for
any purposes with respect to any defined benefit pension plan, or any equity-based or nonqualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement, or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or
A-34
Table of Contents
its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid
in accordance with such New Plan.
(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at
or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.
(d) The Company may pay transaction bonuses in accordance with Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to each retired Company Employee who, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, was a retired participant in the medical benefits provided under a Company Benefit Plan, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company to, make available to such retired Company Employee (and, if applicable, his or her dependents who were covered under such
Company Benefit Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) participation in the medical benefits provided under the New Plans through October
31, 2022; provided that such retired Company Employee pays 100% of the applicable premiums.
(f) Upon Parent’s reasonable request from time to time (but up until sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated date of the Effective
Time no more frequently than once per quarter, except where there is reasonable reason to believe that there has been a material change to the
calculations since the immediately prior request), the Company shall, a reasonable period of time following receipt of such request (but in no event more
than five (5) Business Days following receipt of such request), provide Parent with the then-most recent calculations and reasonable back-up information
relating to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code relating to the Merger, including any non-compete valuations.
(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate unless Parent otherwise provides notice to the Company not later than thirty
(30) calendar days in advance of the Effective Time, the Company employee stock ownership plan (the “Company ESOP”) and any or all Company 401(k)
plans. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence such plans have been terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors or any applicable committee thereof. The form and substance of such resolutions (and
other written instruments, as applicable) shall be subject to review and comment by Parent, and the Company shall consider in good faith any such
comments. The Company also shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such plans as Parent may
reasonably require. Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts under any Company 401(k) plan to the participants, Parent shall permit such
participants who are then actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash, from the Company plan to the applicable Tax-qualified defined contribution plans of
Parent or its Subsidiaries. Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts under the Company ESOP to the participants, Parent shall permit such
participants who are then actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions, in the form of cash, from the Company ESOP to
the applicable Tax-qualified defined contribution plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries.
(h) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, (i) the provisions of this Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, (ii) no current or former director, employee or consultant or any other person shall (A) be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or (B)
have any right to continued employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates or to any particular term or condition of employment as a result of this
Agreement and (iii) nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or
arrangement for any purpose. The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger.

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior to the End Date, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or

approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any Actions, lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required (nor, without the prior written consent of Parent, shall the Company and its Subsidiaries be
permitted) to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration (other than customary filing and notification fees with Governmental
Entities and other nominal amounts) to any third party for any consent or approval required for or triggered by the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or agreement or otherwise.
(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (and, to the extent
applicable, Parent shall cause the Equity Investors to) (i) (A) file or cause to be filed any and all required notification and report forms under the HSR Act
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the transactions contemplated by the Investment
Agreement) no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the date hereof (provided, that (1) if the Company and Parent have not filed the required
notification and report forms under the HSR Act by the thirtieth (30th) calendar day from the date hereof, the Company and Parent will consult with one
another in good faith to mutually determine whether to accelerate the filing of the required notification and report forms under the HSR Act, and (2) if at
any point prior to the Company and Parent filing the required notification and report forms under the HSR Act, Parent determines in good faith that it
would be necessary, proper or advisable to accelerate such filing in order to obtain the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act as promptly as
practicable, Parent shall notify the Company thereof in writing, and Parent and the Company shall file the required notification and report forms under the
HSR Act as promptly as practicable thereafter), and (B) use all reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act, (ii) no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date hereof, make or cause to be made the requisite initial submissions for
the required filings specified in Schedule 6.1(c) of this Agreement with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement), (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining
whether any other filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any third parties or Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) promptly making or causing to be made all such filings and
timely obtaining all such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or expirations or terminations of waiting periods, (iv) supply or

proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as may be necessary
to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state
antitrust enforcement authorities, or any other Governmental Entity or Person may assert under any applicable
A-36
Table of Contents
antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable antitrust
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof (and in any event no later than the End Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold separate or disposition of any and all of the share capital or other equity voting interest,
assets (whether tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parent’s or its Subsidiaries’
(including the Surviving Corporation’s) or Affiliates’ freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their Subsidiaries’
(including the Surviving Corporation’s), assets (whether tangible or intangible), businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines (such
actions described in clause (iv), “Divestiture Actions”), in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Action that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, materially delaying
the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; provided, that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to become
subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order to sell,
divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets (whether tangible or
intangible), businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines of the Company or any of its Affiliates, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on or otherwise applicable to the Company only from and after the Effective Time in the event that the
Closing occurs; provided, further, that, anything to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) without limiting Parent’s obligations under this Section 5.8, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to take, or propose or agree to take, any Divestiture Action without the prior written consent
of Parent (provided, that such prior written consent when provided by Parent shall also constitute Parent’s prior written consent with respect to the

of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest
and resist any such Action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Action, decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree to cause the Surviving Corporation to provide that all rights, to the extent permitted by Law, to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current and former directors, officers and employees appointed by
the Company’s President to serve on its Executive Committee and those employees selected by the Executive Committee to be Division Managers (the
“Executive Committee Employees ”), as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue at and after the Effective Time in full force and
effect. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company’s and any of its Subsidiaries’ articles or certificates of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or
its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or the Executive Committee Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals
who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or the Executive Committee Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six (6)-year period. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this
Section 5.11.
(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing or any
related expenses prior to final determination that indemnification is available, as such expenses are incurred for such Indemnified Party) each current and
former director, officer or Executive Committee Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of
or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators, and successors and assigns, an
“Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Action
to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law following receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Person to repay such amount
if it is ultimately determined that such Person was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.11, solely to the extent such undertaking is required
under applicable Law or the Company’s organizational documents), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (an “Action”), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before
or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other
A-39

fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries). In the event of any such Action, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Action with separate counsel and at their sole expense, and the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and the Surviving Company in connection therewith.
(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by or
for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the
existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable in the aggregate to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and
officers with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought),
except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate
annual premium most recently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Maximum Amount”). If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this Section 5.11(c) because its cost exceeds the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
the years within such six (6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company
may, at its option, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such tail policy to provide coverage in an amount not
less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable in the aggregate to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the
Maximum Amount. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.11 (subject to the undertakings described in Section 5.11(b)).
(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party
may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the MBCA or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.
(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

Section 5.12 Financing.
(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter prior
to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including by using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the “Definitive
Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions
contained in the Redacted Fee Letter and any amendment or modification permitted under clause (b) below)), or on other terms that are acceptable to
Parent and Merger Sub in their sole discretion and would not reasonably be expected to materially delay the Closing or adversely affect the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions under its control in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements and comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements and
(iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements.
(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed): (i) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) adds new (or modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the Merger, the Debt
Financing or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) reduces the amount of the Financing below the Merger Amounts at the Closing
or (C) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof; or (ii) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver
to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prevent the Parent
from replacing or amending the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements in order to (w) add lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and to grant to such persons such approval rights as are
customarily granted to additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, so long as any such addition would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the Merger, the Debt Financing or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (x) give effect to the market flex provisions in the Redacted Fee Letter, (y) modify titles, allocations and fee sharing arrangements with respect
to existing and additional Debt Financing Entities and (z) increase the amount of the Debt Financing unless, in the case of this clause (z), Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries would not be Solvent after giving effect to such increase and the consummation of the Merger.
(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts as promptly as practicable to (i) obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the Cash Equity and the
available portion of the Debt Financing, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the other Merger Amounts) on
terms and conditions not materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent than the terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (taking into account any market “flex” terms) and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor;
provided, that, in no event shall Parent and Merger Sub be obligated to accept or pursue any such alternative financing if it is materially less favorable
(taken as a whole) to Parent than the terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account any market
“flex” terms). If any alternative financing is required in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative debt financing, and
Parent shall
A-41
Table of Contents
comply with its covenants in this Section 5.12(c) with respect to such new financing commitment (as if such financing commitment were the Debt
Commitment Letter). For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Debt Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in
question). Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of any actual or threatened breach, termination, repudiation or default by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement or the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt
Financing Entity with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement
of any provision thereof. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, in all material respects, on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Debt Financing.
(d) The foregoing notwithstanding (but subject to Section 8.5(b)), compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 5.12 shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is
available.
(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to use reasonable best efforts, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent necessary or customary for
the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including by (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, at reasonable times and with reasonable advance notice, (ii) to the extent required by the Debt Financing,
using reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral, effective no earlier than the Effective Time (including executing and delivering as of (but
not prior to) the Closing, any pledge and security documents or other definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent;
provided, that, (A) none of the documents shall be executed and/or delivered except in connection with the Closing, (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be
conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence of the Closing and (C) no liability shall be imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or employees involved prior to the Closing Date with respect to such matters), (iii) furnishing Parent and
the Debt Financing Entities as promptly as reasonably practicable following the delivery of a request therefor to the Company by Parent (which notice
shall state with specificity the information requested) all Required Information (provided, that, the Company will have no obligation to prepare pro forma
financial information), and periodically updating any Required Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required Information (A)
is Compliant and (B) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition of “Required Information,” (iv) furnishing the Parent and the Debt
Financing Entities promptly, and in any event at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all documentation and other information about the

anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, that is required under any Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive
Agreements to the extent such documentation and other information is requested in writing to the Company at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and (v) subject to customary confidentiality provisions and disclaimers, provide customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing
Entities authorizing the distribution of information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to prospective lenders or investors. The foregoing
notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to this Section
5.12(e) that: (1) would require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are officers or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries to pass
resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or enter into, execute or deliver any certificate, document, opinion,
instrument or agreement (except for customary authorization letters under clause (v) above) or agree to any change or modification of any existing
certificate, document, opinion, instrument or agreement, (2) would cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (unless waived by the Parent), (3) would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or
other similar fee prior to the Closing or incur any other material expense, liability or obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing or

letters under clause (v) above), (4) would cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
personal liability (other than arising under applicable Law in connection with resolutions or consents by officers or directors which are subject to the
occurrence of the Closing and passed by directors or officers continuing in their positions following the Closing), (5) would conflict with the
organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any applicable Laws, (6) would reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or
breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, in

that are not readily available to the Company or prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice or (9) would unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this Section 5.12(e) or otherwise shall require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
in connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the
request of Parent pursuant to this Section 5.12(e) and any information used in connection therewith (other than information provided in writing by the
Company or its Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.12(e)) (collectively, the “Reimbursement
Obligations”); except in the event such losses are determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out
of, or resulted from, the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconducts of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.
Without limiting Section 8.5(b), it is acknowledged that in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing with respect thereto)) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any
other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement. The Company hereby consents
to the use of the Company’s and the Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such trademarks and logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

below), all notices and to take all other reasonable actions to facilitate (A) the repayment (using funds provided by Parent in accordance with the
following sentence) in full on the Closing Date (or in the case of any letters of credit, cash collateralization, to the extent that Parent shall not have entered
into an alternative arrangement with the issuing bank) of all amounts and other obligations then outstanding under and (B) the termination (to the extent
provided therein and pursuant to the terms thereof) on the Closing Date of (such repayments and terminations, the “Existing Credit Facilities

contemplated by this Agreement, (B) reduces the amount of the Financing below the Merger Amounts at the Closing or (C) adversely affects the ability

the applicable Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such
payment is required to be made (collectively, the “Enforcement Expenses”). The parties further acknowledge that neither the Company Termination
Fee nor the applicable Parent Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or the applicable Parent Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties
acknowledge that the right to receive the Company Termination Fee or the applicable Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not limit or
otherwise affect any such party’s right to specific performance as provided in Section 8.5; provided, that under no circumstances shall the
Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the Effective Time occurring and the
applicable Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, being paid.

with any Enforcement Expenses and any Reimbursement Obligations and expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.2 shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company Related Parties against any Parent Related Party for all
losses and damages in respect of this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the

Breach), intentional, unilateral or otherwise) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or
any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and upon payment of the applicable Parent Termination Fee to the
Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b), together with the Enforcement Expenses, any Reimbursement Obligations and any expenses payable pursuant
to Section 8.2, (A) none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Guarantees, the Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (B) none of the
Company Related Parties shall seek to recover any other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages

otherwise) by Parent or Merger Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or arising from any
claim or cause of action that any Company Related Party may have with respect thereto, including in respect of any representation made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith, including for a breach of Section 2.2(a) as a result of the Financing not being available or otherwise arising from
the Commitment Letters or the Guarantees or in respect of any representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith.

warranty, covenant or agreement made by Walnut hereunder shall be to seek specific performance of Walnut’s obligations under Section 5.2 to the
extent provided in Section 8.5 and in no event shall any breach or alleged breach by Walnut of any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement give rise to monetary damages against Walnut or any Parent Related Party, and (B) if the Company seeks to recover any damages
(including for Willful Breach) or any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any
losses or damages suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any oral representation made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith and this Agreement has been terminated under circumstances where the Parent Equity Financing Termination
Fee is required to be paid, or where such claim otherwise relates to a failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 8.2 of the Investment
Agreement, the Parent Damage Cap (including any obligation to pay the Parent Equity Financing Termination Fee) shall equal $300,000,000.

Parties against the Company Related Parties for all losses and damages in respect of this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or the failure of such transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (whether willful
(including Willful Breach), intentional, unilateral or otherwise) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of
this Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee
to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(a), together with the Enforcement Expenses and any expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.2, (A) none of the

herewith. The foregoing notwithstanding, following termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company, Parent may seek monetary

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, subject to Section 8.5(b), in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, including for the avoidance of doubt, the covenants
and agreements of Walnut in Section 5.2, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in
law or equity, including monetary damages, but subject to the limitations on such remedies under this Agreement or the Guarantees) to obtain (i) a decree
or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach
or threatened breach.
(b) In circumstances where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be
inadequate to compensate the Company, and that the Company shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in
law or equity, including monetary damages, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3) to specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the Cash
Equity to be funded under the Investment Agreement and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger at any time after the SP
Right Notice Period if, but only if, (i) all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII of the Investment Agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions, that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing under the Investment Agreement, but that such conditions are capable of being
satisfied as of such closing), (ii) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but that such conditions are capable of being satisfied as of such Closing), (iii) the Company shall
have given Parent at least three (3) Business Days’ prior irrevocable written notice (the “SP Right Notice Period”) (provided that the SP Right Notice
Period may not commence prior to the date set forth in the proviso to Section 1.2) of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section
6.3 (and that those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur) and that, if
specific performance is granted and the Cash Equity and Debt Financing are funded, the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing and (iv) Parent fails to consummate the Closing by the end of the SP Right Notice Period.
(c) Each party further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The parties acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence
and that the parties would suffer ongoing irreparable injury for so long as any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms (but subject to any time period allotted for such performance by such terms), including but not limited to as a result of any dispute over the
parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. It is accordingly agreed that, as to any claims or Actions in which a party seeks
specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this Section 8.5, the parties shall use their best efforts to seek and obtain an expedited schedule
for such proceedings and shall not oppose any party’s request for expedited proceedings.

however, that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the

terms used in such provisions) shall be in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Walnut, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. The foregoing notwithstanding, no failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder.

The Board of Directors
Sanderson Farms, Inc.

The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of Sanderson Farms, Inc., a Mississippi business corporation (the
“Company”), of the $203.00 per Share in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
proposed to be entered into (the “Agreement”) by and among Walnut Sycamore Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Sycamore
Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), the Company, and solely for
purposes of certain provisions thereof, Wayne Farms LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wayne Farms”). The Agreement provides that Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the
“Transaction”), as a result of which the Company will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each Share that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement), (ii) the Cancelled Shares (as
defined in the Agreement) and (iii) Shares covered by Company Restricted Share Awards (as defined in the Agreement) (the shares referred to in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), together with any Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, “Excluded Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right
to receive $203.00 per Share in cash, without interest, (the $203.00 per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the “Consideration”). The terms and
conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our
services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us
against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and
merchant banking activities. In the past two years, we have provided general financial advisory services to the Company, and we have received
compensation from the Company during such period. In the past two years, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to
Parent, Merger Sub, Wayne Farms or Cargill, Incorporated, an affiliate of Parent (“Cargill”), and we have not received any compensation from Parent,
Merger Sub, Wayne Farms or Cargill during such period. In the past two years, we have been engaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to
the Company to Continental Grain Company Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Continental Grain Company”), the indirect majority owner of Wayne Farms,
in connection with certain internal matters, and we have received compensation from Continental Grain Company for such services. We may provide
financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company, Parent, Wayne Farms, Cargill, Continental Grain Company or their respective
affiliates
