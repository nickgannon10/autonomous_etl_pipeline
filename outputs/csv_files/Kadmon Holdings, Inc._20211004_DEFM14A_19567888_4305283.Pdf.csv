The Special Meeting will be held on November 5, 2021, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at 450 East 29th Street, New York, NY
10016, or at any postponement or adjournment thereof. In the event it is not possible or advisable to hold the Special

promptly as practicable, which may include holding the Special Meeting solely by means of remote communication.
In person attendance at the Special Meeting will be subject to applicable health and safety restrictions relating to
COVID-19, and as a result, stockholders are encouraged to vote by submitting a proxy by telephone, over the
Internet, by returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.
At the Special Meeting, holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock will be asked to:
1.
consider and vote upon the proposal (the “Merger Proposal”) to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve
the Merger, as more fully described in this proxy statement and under “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement” beginning on page 74; and
2.
consider and vote upon the proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”) to adjourn the Special Meeting, if

reasonable amount of time in advance of the Special Meeting, or to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, as more fully

1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Record Date and Quorum
You are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting if you owned shares of Common Stock
and/or Preferred Stock at the close of business on September 27, 2021, which the Company has set as the record date
for the Special Meeting (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote for each share of Common Stock that you owned
on the Record Date and approximately 134 votes for each share of Preferred Stock that you owned as of the Record
Date. As of the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 shares of Common Stock and 28,708 shares of Preferred Stock
(which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights equivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of Common
Stock) outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or
represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date will constitute a quorum, permitting the conduct of business
at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as described below) are counted as present for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.
Vote Required
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) entitled
to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the
Merger Proposal.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) present in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is
present. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against approval of this proposal. Broker non-votes are not
counted for purposes of this proposal.
Litigation Related to the Merger
On October 1 and 4, 2021, two alleged stockholders of the Company filed actions in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against the Company and the members of its Board of Directors under the following
captions: (i) Nancy Jaser v. Kadmon Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08154 (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Jaser Action”); (ii) John
Dillon v. Kadmon Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08169 (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Dillon Action,” and collectively, the
“Actions”). The Actions assert claims solely on behalf of the individual stockholders and generally allege that the
Company and its Board of Directors failed to disclose allegedly material information in the proxy statement. The
Actions seek an order enjoining the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
awarding damages. We believe that the claims asserted in the Actions are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising
out of the Merger Agreement may be filed in the future. If additional similar lawsuits are filed, absent new or different
allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily announce such additional filings.
Proxies and Revocation
Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet,
by returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or may vote in person by
appearing at the Special Meeting. If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” through a bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote your
shares of Common Stock using the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. If you fail to
submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee with instructions, as applicable, your shares of Common Stock will not be voted on the Merger Proposal,
which will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the Merger Proposal, and your shares of Common Stock
will not have an effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before
it is exercised, by voting again at a later date through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of
revocation to our Secretary or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company. The Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving
Corporation”), will become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi and will continue to exist following the
Merger. As a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company. In addition, the Common
Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic
reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of Sanofi or the
Surviving Corporation.
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will be amended and restated as provided in the Merger Agreement. The directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation will, from and after the Effective Time, be the individuals who are the directors and officers of
the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Merger Consideration
In the Merger, each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
held by the Company as treasury stock and shares of Common Stock owned by the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and shares of Common Stock owned by stockholders who have perfected
and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal with respect to such shares of Common Stock
(collectively the “Excluded Shares”)) will be canceled and cease to exist and be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $9.50, without interest thereon (the “Common Stock Merger Consideration”). At the Effective
Time of the Merger, each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and cease to exist and automatically convert into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Liquidation Preference Amount (as defined in the
Company’s Certificate of Designation dated July 26, 2016) plus any dividends (whether or not earned or declared)
accrued and unpaid thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designation)
through the closing date of the Merger and (ii) the amount that would be payable per share of Preferred Stock if such
share of Preferred Stock had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger
(the “Preferred Stock Merger Consideration” and, together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the
“Merger Consideration”).
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii)
resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger, and
(iv) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s stockholders for their adoption. The Board

We anticipate that the total funds needed by Sanofi and Merger Sub to (1) pay our stockholders and holders of
equity awards the amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement and (2) pay related fees and expenses in
connection with the Merger and associated transactions will be approximately $1.9 billion. We anticipate that the
funds needed to pay the amounts described above will come from Sanofi’s cash on hand.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The exchange of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders that are U.S. holders and that exchange
their shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock in the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the cash received pursuant to the Merger, including any applicable withholding taxes, and
their adjusted tax basis in their shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock. Backup withholding (currently at a
rate of 24%) may also apply to the cash received pursuant to the Merger unless the applicable U.S. holder provides a
taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct and that is not subject to backup withholding on
IRS Form W-9 and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. You should read “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 52 for the definition of “U.S. holder” and a
more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You should also consult your
tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the Merger on your federal, state and local and/or non-U.S. taxes.
Regulatory Approvals
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until, following the submission of
required filings with the relevant governmental authorities, the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the
Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), has expired
or been terminated, and neither Sanofi nor the Company shall have received a standard form letter from the Federal
Trade Commission Bureau of Competition (“FTC”), in the form announced and disclosed by the FTC on August 3,
2021, for which the Parties shall not have been notified by the FTC that such underlying investigation has been
closed or otherwise resolved.
On September 20, 2021, the Company and Sanofi filed notification of the proposed Merger with the FTC and the
Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these
5
TABLE OF CONTENTS
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These
conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied on a timely basis or at all.

Stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under the General Corporation Law of the state of Delaware (the “DGCL”)
in connection with the Merger. This means that you are entitled to have the fair value of your shares of Common
Stock and/or Preferred Stock determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment based on that
valuation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL. The
ultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you
would have received under the Merger Agreement.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is
taken on the Merger Agreement and you must not vote, either in person or by proxy, in favor of the Merger Proposal.
Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights.
See “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 79 and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute reproduced in its
entirety as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee. In view of the complexity of the DGCL, stockholders who wish to pursue appraisal
rights should consult their legal and financial advisors promptly.
Delisting and Deregistration of Common Stock
If the Merger is completed, the Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange
Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the
Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that may be important to you as a Company stockholder. Please refer to the “Summary” and the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents
referred to in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the
information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form?
A.
You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form because the Company is
holding a Special Meeting and you own shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock. This proxy statement
describes matters on which we urge you to vote and is intended to assist you in deciding how to vote.
Q.
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A.
The Special Meeting will be held on November 5, 2021 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at 450 East 29th Street, New York,
NY 10016. In person attendance at the Special Meeting will be subject to applicable health and safety restrictions
relating to COVID-19.
In the event it is not possible or advisable to hold the Special Meeting in person, we will announce by issuance
of a press release alternative arrangements for the meeting as promptly as practicable, which may include
holding the Special Meeting solely by means of remote communication.
Q.
What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A.
You are being asked to consider and vote on the Merger Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Q.
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on the Company?
A.
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of the Company by Sanofi pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the
Merger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger
Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
becoming a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi. As a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be
a public company and you will cease to hold Common Stock or Preferred Stock or have any interest in the
Company’s future earnings or growth. In addition, following the Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from
NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q.
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A.
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Common Stock that you own
and/or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, less any applicable tax withholding, for each
share of Preferred Stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal
rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of Common Stock, you
will receive $950 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, in exchange for your shares. Following
completion of the Merger, you will not own any shares of the capital stock in Sanofi or the Surviving
Corporation. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.
Q.
How does the Common Stock Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Common Stock prior to
announcement of the Merger?
A.
The Common Stock Merger Consideration represents a premium of 79% over the closing price on September 7,
2021 and a premium of approximately 113% over the volume weighted average price for the 60 trading days prior
to such date.
Q.
How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
A.
The Board of Directors recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the Merger Proposal and
“FOR” approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
10TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A.
We are working toward completing the Merger as soon as possible. Assuming timely receipt of required
regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders of the
Merger Proposal, we expect the Merger to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, we cannot
assure completion by any particular date, if at all.
Q.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A.
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the stockholders of the Company or if the Merger is not completed
for any other reason, you will continue to hold your shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock and you
will not receive any payment for such shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an
independent public company, and the Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. Under
specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Sanofi a fee with respect to the termination of
the Merger Agreement as described under “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Expenses.”
Q.
What conditions must be satisfied to complete the Merger?
A.
The respective obligations of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by
our stockholders, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the absence of any legal prohibitions, the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the parties, compliance by the parties with their respective obligations
under the Merger Agreement and the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).
For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the
Merger, see “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to Completion of the Merger” and “The Merger-Regulatory
Approvals”.
Q.
Is the Merger expected to be taxable to me?
A.
The exchange of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder and you exchange your shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock in the Merger for cash, you will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares, including any applicable
withholding taxes, and your adjusted tax basis in such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. Backup
withholding may also apply to the cash received by a non-corporate U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger unless
such U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct and that is not
subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. You
should read “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a more detailed
discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You should also consult your tax advisor
for a complete analysis of the effect of the Merger on your federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.
Q:
What will holders of Company equity-based awards receive in the Merger?
A:
As a result of, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Merger:
•
Without any action on the part of any holder of Company Options (i) all unvested Company Options which
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully vest and become exercisable Company
Options, and (ii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option will be
canceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company Option becoming entitled
to receive an amount in cash equal to the Company Option Merger Consideration. Each Company Option
with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Common Stock Merger Consideration will be
canceled without consideration. Sanofi will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Option
Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to deduction for any required tax withholding, at the
Effective Time or at the Company’s next ordinary course payroll date (but in no event later than 20 business
days after the Effective Time).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Without any action on the part of any holder of Company SARs, all unvested Company SARs which are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully vest, and each Company SAR that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled at the Effective Time, with the former
holder of such canceled Company SAR becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Company SAR Merger Consideration. Sanofi will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company
SAR Merger Consideration at the Effective Time or at the Company’s next ordinary course payroll date (but
in no event later than 20 business days after the Effective Time).
•
All unvested Company EARs which are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully
vest, and each Company EAR that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled at
the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company EAR becoming entitled to receive the
Company EAR Merger Consideration. Sanofi will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company
EAR Merger Consideration at the Effective Time or at the Company’s next ordinary course payroll (but in
no event later than 20 business days after the Effective Time).
•
Following the Agreement Date, (i) with respect to any outstanding Offering Period(s) (as defined in the
Company ESPP) under the Company ESPP as of the Agreement Date, no participant in the Company ESPP
may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election in effect on the Agreement
Date for such Offering Period and no new participants may participate in such Offering Period; (ii) no new
Offering Period will commence under the Company ESPP on or after the Agreement Date; (iii) any Offering
Period under the Company ESPP that does not end prior to the Effective Time will terminate and a
Subscription Date (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) will occur under the ESPP immediately
prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Offering Period, in which case any shares of Common Stock
purchased under the Offering Period will be treated the same as all other shares of Common Stock in the
Merger; and (iv) immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company ESPP will terminate.
Q.
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the Merger Proposal?
A.
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common
Stock) entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the Special Meeting,
or abstain, or you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with instructions, as applicable,
this will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal.
As of close of business on the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 outstanding shares of Common Stock and
28,708 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights
equivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of common stock as of the Record Date).
Q.
What vote of stockholders is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal?
A.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock)
present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, whether or
not a quorum is present.
Abstaining will have the same effect as a vote against the Adjournment Proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy or
to vote in person at the Special Meeting or if your shares of Common Stock are held through a bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares of
Common Stock, your shares of Common Stock will not be voted, but this will not have an effect on the
Adjournment Proposal.
Q.
Do any of the Company’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be in
addition to my interests as a stockholder?
A.
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors, you should be aware that our directors and
executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, yours. The Board of
Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger and in
recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company. For more
information see “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A.
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. In this case, we have
sent this proxy statement and your proxy card to you directly. As the stockholder of record, you have the right
to vote, grant your voting directly to the Company or to a third party or to vote in person at the meeting.
If your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of
shares held in “street name,” and your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee is considered the stockholder of
record with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee. You should follow the instructions provided by them to vote your shares. You
are invited to attend the Special Meeting; however, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting
unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that holds your shares,
giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.
Q.
If my shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will
my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee vote my shares of Common Stock for me?
A.
Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares if you instruct your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares. Under the rules of NASDAQ, banks,
brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in street name for customers have the authority to vote on
“routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks,
brokerage firms and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to
approving non-routine matters, such as the Merger Proposal, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from
the beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those
shares on non-routine matters. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your
shares of Common Stock, your shares will not be voted (“broker non-votes”) and the effect will be the same as a
vote against approval of the Merger Proposal, and your shares will not have an effect on the Adjournment
Proposal.
Q.
Who can vote at the Special Meeting?
A.
All holders of record of Common Stock and Preferred Stock as of the close of business on September 27, 2021,
the Record Date, are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
Q.
How many votes do I have?
A.
On each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting, you are entitled to one vote for each share of
Common Stock and approximately 134 votes for each share of Preferred Stock held of record as of the Record
Date. As of close of business on the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 outstanding shares of Common Stock
and 28,708 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights
equivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date).
Q.
What is a quorum?
A.
The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote are present in
person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum, permitting the conduct of
business at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present.

subsequently voting via telephone or the Internet. Record holders may also revoke their proxies by voting in
person at the Special Meeting or by notifying the Company’s Secretary in writing at: Kadmon Holdings, Inc.,
Attention: Corporate Secretary, 450 East 29th Street, New York, NY 10016
Q.
What is a proxy?
A.
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy
statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares is called a “proxy card.”
Q.
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock voted?
A.
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your
shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card,
you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or
none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” approval of the Merger
Proposal and “FOR” approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
Q.
How are votes counted?
A.
For the Merger Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions and broker non-
votes will have the same effect as votes against the Merger Proposal.
For the Adjournment Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will have the
same effect as if you voted against the Adjournment Proposal, but broker non-votes will not have an effect on
the proposal.
Q.
What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
A.
If you hold shares of Common Stock in “street name” and also directly as a record holder or otherwise, you may
receive more than one proxy and/or set of voting instructions relating to the Special Meeting. Please vote each
proxy or voting instruction card in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement in order to
ensure that all of your shares are voted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting?
A.
The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than both the date of the
Special Meeting and the consummation of the Merger. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a
proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares and each of you notifies the
Company in writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the Special
Meeting but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares.
Q.
What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock after the Special Meeting but before
the Effective Time?
A.
If you transfer your shares of Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective Time, you will
have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares.
In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
through completion of the Merger.
Q.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A.
The Company has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. (“DF King”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the
Special Meeting. The Company estimates that it will pay DF King a fee of $25,000. The Company has also agreed
to reimburse DF King for, pay directly, or, where requested in special situations, advance sufficient funds for the
payment of, certain fees, costs and expenses and will also indemnify DF King, its affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives and controlling persons against certain losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses. The Company may also reimburse banks, brokers or their agents for
certain expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Our
directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or
in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q.
What do I need to do now?
A.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information contained
in this proxy statement, please vote promptly to ensure that your shares are represented at the Special Meeting.
If you hold shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in your own name as the stockholder of record, you may
submit a proxy to have your shares voted at the Special Meeting in one of three ways: (i) completing, signing,
dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope; (ii) calling toll-free at
the telephone number indicated on the enclosed proxy card; or (iii) using the Internet in accordance with the
instructions set forth on the enclosed proxy card. If you decide to attend the Special Meeting and vote in
person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you are a beneficial owner, please
refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above
choices are available to you.
Q.
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A.
No. If the Merger Proposal is approved, you will be sent a letter of transmittal after the completion of the Merger
describing how you may exchange your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock for the Merger
Consideration. If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to effect the
surrender of your “street name” shares of Common Stock in exchange for the Common Stock Merger
Consideration. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.
Q.
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for
my shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock?
A.
Yes. As a holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the
DGCL in connection with the Merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions, including that you
do not vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. See “Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 79. For the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, please see Annex B hereto.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A.
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two
or more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides
advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate
notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate information
and reduces printing and mailing expenses. We have not instituted householding for stockholders of record;
however, certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of Common Stock held
through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Common Stock, you may have already
received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any
questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate
copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke
your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
Q.
Who can help answer any other questions I might have?
A.
If you have additional questions about the Merger, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your
shares, or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact DF King, our
proxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at (800) 249-7120 or via email at KDMN@dfking.com.

This proxy statement, and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, as well as oral statements
made or to be made by us, contains forward-looking statements, including statements relating directly or indirectly to
the timing or likelihood of completing the Merger, plans for future growth, changes in the business and other
business development activities as well as capital expenditures, financing sources and the effects of regulation and
competition and all other statements regarding our intent, plans, beliefs or expectations or those of our directors or
officers. All statements included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, other than statements that are
historical facts, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “expect,” “should” and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting
management’s reasonable judgment based on currently available information and using numerous assumptions and
involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested
by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in
our filings with the SEC, including our most recent filing on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters contained or
incorporated by reference in this document, and the following factors:
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the
Merger Agreement, including a termination of the Merger Agreement under circumstances that could
require us to pay a termination fee of $60.125 million;
•
the inability to complete the Merger in the anticipated timeframe (or at all) due to the failure to obtain
stockholder approval or the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the Merger, including
receipt of required regulatory approvals;
•
the failure of the Merger to close for any other reason;
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to stockholders that are treated
as U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company and/or others relating to
the Merger Agreement;
•
risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in
retention of executive management and other key employees as a result of the Merger;
•
diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns;
•
limitations placed on our ability to operate the business by the Merger Agreement;
•
difficulties maintaining business and operational relationships, including relationships with clients,
vendors, suppliers, distributors, resellers and other business partners;
•
the uncertainties inherent in research and development of the Company’s products, including future clinical
data and analysis, regulatory obligations and oversight by regulatory authorities and the future approval
and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives;
•
risks associated with the Company’s intellectual property and any related pending or future litigation
relating thereto and the ultimate outcome of such litigation;
•
the effect of the announcement of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results and
business generally;
•
developments beyond our control including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic
conditions that may affect the timing or success of the Merger;
•
the amount of any costs, fees, expenses, impairments and charges related to the Merger; and
•
the risk that if the Merger is not completed, the market price of Common Stock could decline, investor
confidence could decline, stockholder litigation could be brought against us, relationships with clients,
suppliers and other business partners may be adversely impacted, we may be unable to retain key
personnel, and profitability may be adversely impacted due to costs incurred in connection with the
Merger.
The Company believes the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable; however, you should not
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and speak only as of
the date of this proxy statement. Any or all of the Company’s forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong.

We have fixed the close of business on September 27, 2021 as the Record Date for the Special Meeting, and only
holders of record of Common Stock and Preferred Stock on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of, and to
vote at, the Special Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 shares of Common Stock and 28,708 shares
of Preferred Stock (which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights equivalent to approximately 134 shares
of Common Stock as of the Record Date) outstanding and entitled to vote. On all matters properly coming before the
Special Meeting, you will have one vote for each share of Common Stock and approximately 3,851,031 votes per share
of Preferred Stock that you owned on the Record Date.
The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power
of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date will
constitute a quorum, permitting the conduct of business at the Special Meeting. Shares of Common Stock and
Preferred Stock represented at the Special Meeting but not voted, including shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock for which a stockholder directs an “abstention” from voting, will be counted for purposes of establishing a
quorum. Broker non-votes will also be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. A quorum is necessary to
transact business at the Special Meeting. Once a share is represented at the Special Meeting, it will be counted for
the purpose of determining a quorum at the Special Meeting and any adjournment of the Special Meeting. In the
event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned,
postponed or delayed. If we adjourn, postpone or delay the Special Meeting for more than 30 days, or if thereafter a
new Record Date is set, a notice of the adjourned, postponed or delayed meeting will be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting in accordance with our bylaws.

Vote Required",26,27
"Kadmon Holdings, Inc._20211004_DEFM14A_19567888_4305283.Pdf",Vote Required,"Vote Required
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) entitled
to vote thereon. For the Merger Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions, if any,
will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock represented at the
Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved, but will be counted as a vote
against the Merger Proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or abstain, it
will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal.
If your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the “stockholder
of record.” This proxy statement and proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.
If your shares of Common Stock are held through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the
“beneficial owner” of those shares held in street name. In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you
by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares of Common Stock, the
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting.
Under the rules of NASDAQ, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in street name for customers
have the authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners.
However, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with
respect to approving non-routine matters such as the Merger Proposal and, as a result, absent specific instructions
from the beneficial owner of such shares of Common Stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not
empowered to vote those shares on non-routine matters. These broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of
determining a quorum but will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal.
The Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock
and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present.
For the Adjournment Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” For purposes of this proposal, if
your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are present at the Special Meeting but are not voted on this
proposal, or if you have given a proxy and abstained on this proposal, this will have the same effect as if you voted
against approval of the proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy or to attend in person the Special Meeting, or there are
broker non-votes on the issue, as applicable, the shares of Common Stock held by you or your broker will not be
counted in respect of, and will not have an effect on, the Adjournment Proposal.
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock on matters
presented at the Special Meeting in any of the following ways:
•
by proxy:
•
by telephone or over the Internet, by accessing the telephone number or website specified on the
enclosed proxy card. The control number provided on your proxy card is designed to verify your
identity when voting by telephone or by Internet. Please be aware that if you vote by telephone or
over the Internet, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you
will be responsible;
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply
envelope; or
•
in person-you may attend the Special Meeting and cast your vote there. In person attendance at the
Special Meeting will be subject to applicable health and safety restrictions relating to COVID-19.
If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that you
must follow in order to have your shares of Common Stock voted. Those instructions will identify which of the above
choices are available to you in order to have your shares voted. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and
wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, you must provide a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee at the Special Meeting.

On October 1 and 4, 2021, two alleged stockholders of the Company filed the Actions. The Actions assert claims
solely on behalf of the individual stockholders and generally allege that the Company and its Board of Directors
failed to disclose allegedly material information in the proxy statement. The Actions seek an order enjoining the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and awarding damages. We believe that
the claims asserted in the Actions are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger Agreement may be
filed in the future. If additional similar lawsuits are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the

Stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. This means that you are
entitled to have the fair value of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery and to receive payment based on that valuation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly
the procedures specified under the DGCL. The ultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less
than, equal to or more than the amount you would have received under the Merger Agreement.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is
taken on the Merger Agreement and you must not vote (either in person or by proxy) in favor of the Merger
Proposal. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your
appraisal rights. See “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 79 and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute
reproduced in its entirety as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. In view of the complexity of the DGCL, stockholders who may wish to
pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors promptly.

The descriptions of the Merger in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement. You should read the entire Merger Agreement carefully as it is the legal
document that governs the Merger.
Overview
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company. The Company will be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, will become a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi and will continue to exist following the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the
Company will cease to be a publicly traded company, the Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the
Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of Sanofi or the Surviving Corporation.
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided under the DGCL (or at such later time as we and Sanofi may agree and specify in the certificate
of merger).
In the Merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Shares) will be canceled and cease to exist and converted into the right to receive the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes. At the Effective Time of the
Merger, each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and cease to exist and automatically convert into the right to receive the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes. After the
Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any
rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to
receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as
contemplated by the DGCL, as described below under the caption “Appraisal Rights”).

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board of Directors,
members of Company management or the representatives of the Company and other parties.
The Board of Directors, with the Company’s senior management, regularly reviews the Company’s business,
operations, financial performance and strategic direction for the purpose of increasing stockholder value. As part of
this on-going review, the Board of Directors considers the Company’s long-term strategies and plans, changes in the
industry and markets in which the Company operates, execution opportunities and risks, potential strategic
transaction opportunities, including partnership and collaboration opportunities and financial alternatives in light of
developments of the Company’s clinical and commercial stage products. As part of this process, Company
management regularly engages in business development and strategic discussions with various participants in the
biopharmaceutical industry.
On February 16, 2021, the Company issued 3.625% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”) in the
aggregate principal amount of $240 million, the proceeds of which the Company anticipated would enable it to
advance its planned commercial launch efforts for belumosudil and advance certain of its other pipeline product
candidates, including KD033, part of the Company’s immuno-oncology platform.
On June 26, 2021, Matthieu Merlin, Head of Business Development and Licensing (General Medicines Business Unit)
of Sanofi, reached out to a representative of the Company to set up an introductory meeting to explore potential
opportunities for collaboration between the two companies. At the time of Sanofi’s outreach, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (the “FDA”) was reviewing the New Drug Application for belumosudil, the Company’s lead product
candidate, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 30, 2021. Other of the Company’s
product candidates remain in different stages of clinical and preclinical development.
The Company has from time to time utilized the services of Moelis and Cantor Fitzgerald for investment banking and
other financial services unrelated to the Merger, including Cantor Fitzgerald acting as sole bookrunner
23TABLE OF CONTENTS
in connection with the Company’s issuance of the Convertible Notes in February 2021, acting as the placement agent
for the Company’s ongoing at-the-market offering program, executing two block trades on behalf of the Company in
October 2019 and May 2020 and acting as the joint bookrunner for the Company’s public offering of Common Stock
in November 2019.
On June 16, 2021, a representative from a potential strategic bidder for the Company (“Party A”) sent an email to
representatives of Moelis, requesting an introduction to the Company. On June 29, 2021, a representative of Moelis
introduced the representative of Party A to Steven Meehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of
the Company.
On July 8, 2021, representatives of Party A held a conference call with representatives of the Company, including
Harlan W. Waksal, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Meehan, during which the
parties discussed a general corporate overview of each company and potential synergies that may arise from a
collaboration or other strategic transaction.
On July 12, 2021, Mr. Merlin held a video conference with Gregory S. Moss, Executive Vice President, General
Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Chief Compliance Officer of the Company, during which Mr. Merlin and Mr. Moss
each introduced their company to the other, and Mr. Merlin discussed Sanofi’s interest in belumosudil. Mr. Moss
discussed the Company’s overall development plan with respect to belumosudil, including its focus on the United
States and pursuing various global approvals via the FDA’s Project Orbis framework. Mr. Moss also discussed the
Company’s innovative pipeline and various corporate aspects of its business.
On July 16, 2021, the FDA approved belumosudil for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older
with chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. The FDA reviewed
the New Drug Application six weeks ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of August 30, 2021. As a
result of the announcement, the per share price of the Company’s common stock closed at $4.28 on July 16, 2021, up
from $3.55 from the prior trading day’s closing price.
On July 20, 2021, Mr. Merlin held a videoconference with Mr. Moss and other representatives of the Company, during
which Mr. Merlin affirmed Sanofi’s interest in belumosudil but also indicated that Sanofi may be interested in
exploring a larger transaction taking into account the Company’s product candidates still in development in addition
to the commercialization of belumosudil. Mr. Merlin also noted that Sanofi was interested in learning more about the
Company’s immuno-oncology platform and other pipeline assets and programs. On July 20, 2021, the Company
entered into a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi which did not contain standstill provisions.
Mr. Merlin and Mr. Moss held a videoconference on July 21, 2021, where Mr. Merlin asked about the Company’s
work-to-date around potentially separating out the Company’s immuno-oncology platform. Mr. Moss responded that
a detailed analysis had not been conducted but informal options had been contemplated and considered. Mr. Merlin
indicated that Sanofi’s interest was firm and expeditious, and Mr. Merlin and Mr. Moss agreed that an in-person
management presentation was an appropriate next step, as well as contemporaneous subject matter expert
discussion.
On July 26, 2021, Kadmon and Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement with standstill provisions (which
permitted private waivers of the standstill provision and contained a customary “fallaway” provision in the event the
Company announced a change of control transaction).
On July 27, 2021, representatives of the Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Moss, and Dr. Jeegar Patel, Senior Vice
President, Research and Non-Clinical Development, held a meeting with representatives from Sanofi (including Mr.
Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, Chief Financial Officer of Sanofi, Mr. Olivier Charmeil, Executive Vice President - General
Medicines of Sanofi, Mr. Loic Gonnet, Global Head of Mergers & Acquisitions of Sanofi, and Mr. Merlin), with Mr.
Meehan and other representatives of Sanofi participating by videoconference. During this meeting the parties
discussed information regarding belumosudil, the Company’s immuno-oncology platform and other information
regarding the Company and its additional pipeline candidates. At a dinner following the meeting, Mr. de Chatillon,
Mr. Charmeil and Mr. Gonnet confirmed that Sanofi was interested in acquiring the Company.
On July 28, 2021, representatives of the Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Moss and Dr. Patel met with
representatives of Party A in their European headquarters with Mr. Meehan and certain representatives of Party A
participating by videoconference. During this meeting the parties discussed belumosudil, the Company’s product
pipeline and other information. Also, during this meeting, Party A indicated that it was interested in acquiring the
Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
A potential strategic bidder for the Company (“Party B”) had previously indicated an interest in exploring potential
business development opportunities with the Company following approval of belumosudil. Accordingly, as the
Company began to have discussions with Sanofi and Party A, the Company and representatives of the Company
Financial Advisors discussed reaching out to Party B. On July 29, 2021, Mr. Meehan had a telephone call with a
representative of Party B to let them know the Company may be considering a potential collaboration or other
strategic transactions and to gauge their interest in exploring such a potential transaction.
On July 30, 2021, Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss held an informal discussion with Mr. Tasos Konidaris,
Chairman of the Board of Directors, and directors Mr. Arthur Kirsch and Ms. Nancy Miller-Rich, during which
management provided an update of the discussions with Sanofi, Party A and Party B.
On July 30, 2021, the Company received an e-mail from a representative of Party B introducing representatives of the
Company, including Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, to other representatives of Party B for purposes of discussing a
potential transaction.
On August 1, 2021, the Company and Sanofi amended their confidentiality agreement to provide for standstill
provisions (which permitted private waivers of the standstill provisions and contained a customary “fallaway”
provision in the event the Company announced a change of control transaction).
On August 3, 2021, the Board of Directors held a regular meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss, representatives
of each of the Company Financial Advisors and a representative of DLA Piper LLP (US) (“DLA Piper”), outside
counsel to the Company. Management discussed with the Board of Directors the interest in the Company by Sanofi,
Party A and Party B and the related discussions to date. The representative of DLA Piper then reviewed with the
Board of Directors their fiduciary duties and related considerations. After discussion and deliberation, including with
respect to potential benefits to the Company’s stockholders of a potential sale of the Company and the risk and
uncertainties if the Company were to remain an independent public company, the Board of Directors determined it to
be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to take further steps to confidentially explore the
potential interest of third parties to acquire the Company, including the interest of Sanofi, Party A and Party B. The
Board of Directors also designated Mr. Konidaris, Mr. Kirsch and Ms. Miller-Rich, each of whom is an independent,
disinterested director, and Dr. Waksal, as members of a transaction committee of the Board of Directors (the
“Transaction Committee”) and instructed the Transaction Committee to engage Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis, and to
oversee the activities of management and Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis in connection with exploring a potential sale
of the Company and to provide follow-up communication to the Board of Directors, as appropriate. However, the
Board of Directors determined that final authority with respect to any transaction would reside with the full Board of
Directors. The Transaction Committee was set up for efficiency purposes, and not due to any perceived conflict of
interest with respect to any member of the Board of Directors.
On August 4, 2021, each of Sanofi and Party A were notified that the Board of Directors had engaged the Company
Financial Advisors and authorized the exploration of a potential sale of the Company. In addition, Party A was
provided access to a virtual data room. Also on August 4, 2021, the Company received a non-binding indication of
interest from Sanofi to acquire all of the Common Stock for $7.00 per share, a 55% premium to the closing price per
share on August 3, 2021, and with a request to enter into an exclusivity agreement. After receipt of the non-binding
indication of interest, the Transaction Committee held a virtual meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss, Kyle
Carver, the Company’s Chief Accounting Officer, representatives of the Company Financial Advisors and
representatives of DLA Piper to review the Sanofi non-binding indication of interest and, after discussion, determined
that it undervalued the Company. After discussion, the Transaction Committee directed management of the Company
to inform Sanofi that the proposal undervalued the Company and the Company was not interested in a transaction at
that level. Following the meeting, management delivered the Board of Director’s message to Sanofi.
Between August 4, 2021 and August 23, 2021, Party A conducted due diligence.
On August 5, 6 and 7, 2021, the Company Financial Advisors held calls with representatives of Centerview Partners,
financial advisor to Sanofi (“Centerview”) to discuss the Company’s rationale for rejecting Sanofi’s August 4, 2021
proposal.
On August 5, 2021, the Company and Party B entered into a confidentiality agreement that contained standstill
provisions (which permitted private waivers of the standstill provision, private offers to the Board of Directors and
contained a customary “fallaway” provision in the event the Company announced a change of control transaction).

On August 6, 2021, Party B was provided access to the virtual data room. Also on August 6, 2021, representatives of

request to enter into an exclusivity agreement.
On August 10, the Transaction Committee, together with Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, met to discuss interactions to
date with Sanofi, Party A and Party B and to review Sanofi’s August 9, 2021 revised non-binding indication of
interest. The Transaction Committee instructed the management team to explore potential transaction opportunities
with parties other than Sanofi, Party A and Party B. The Transaction Committee also instructed the Company’s
management team to convey to Sanofi that the Company would not agree to exclusivity at an offer price of $9.00 per
share, but that it would allow Sanofi to begin conducting its due diligence. In addition, after discussions with
management and representatives of the Company Financial Advisors, the Transaction Committee directed
representatives of the Company Financial Advisors to reach out to six other strategic companies to gauge their
interest in a potential transaction with the Company.
Between August 10 and August 11, at the direction of Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, representatives of the
Company Financial Advisors contacted six other strategic companies in connection with exploring a business
combination transaction with the Company, but none of the six parties expressed meaningful interest in such a
transaction.
On August 11, 2021, at the direction of the Transaction Committee, representatives of the Company Financial
Advisors discussed Sanofi’s August 9, 2021 proposal with representatives of Centerview and conveyed that,
although Sanofi’s August 9, 2021 proposal was below the Company’s expectations and exclusivity would not be
granted, Sanofi and its representatives would be provided with access to a virtual data room in order to conduct due
diligence.
On August 11, 2021, Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss and Mr. Patel participated in a management presentation with
representatives of Party B by videoconference.

that it was no longer interested in acquiring the Company due to the anticipated time frame for obtaining marketing
authorization for belumosudil in Europe.
On August 19, 2021, representatives of the Company participated in numerous due diligence calls with Sanofi
regarding various matters, including product lifecycle management, clinical studies and finance.
On August 21, 2021, the Company received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Sanofi to acquire all of
the Common Stock for $9.50 per share, an 88% premium to the closing price per share on August 20, 2021, and with a
request to enter into an exclusivity agreement.
On August 22, 2021 and August 24, 2021, the compensation committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation
Committee”) held special meetings, with representatives of DLA Piper present, to discuss and
26

evaluate potential adjustments to the compensation arrangements and retention bonuses for Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan
and Mr. Moss. To aid in such discussion, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed compensation data
for comparable companies provided by the Company’s executive compensation consultants, Veritas.
At the direction of senior management of the Company, on August 22, 2021, representatives of the Company
Financial Advisors held a call with the representatives of Centerview, during which Centerview confirmed that the
August 21, 2021 Sanofi offer was a “final offer.”
On August 23, 2021, the Board of Directors held a special meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss, Mr. Carver,
representatives of DLA Piper and representatives of the Company Financial Advisors to review the revised Sanofi
proposal. Management and representatives of the Company Financial Advisors provided an update to the Board of
Directors on the process conducted to date, including that Party B was significantly behind in conducting due
diligence and that it was not in a position to provide an indication of value. Based in part on the status of
discussions with Party B, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to enter into an exclusivity agreement with
Sanofi based on a price per share of at least $9.50. After the meeting of the Board of Directors, Mr. Waksal delivered a
letter to Sanofi confirming that the Company would enter into an exclusivity agreement, subject to mutually agreeable
terms.
On August 23, 2021, the Transaction Committee held a virtual special meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss,
Mr. Carver, and representatives of DLA Piper to review the proposed draft merger agreement (which draft agreement
had been provided to the Transaction Committee in advance of the meeting), which included a Company termination
fee equal to approximately 2.5% of the Company’s equity value payable upon termination under certain
circumstances. After discussion, the Transaction Committee directed DLA Piper to distribute the draft merger
agreement to Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel to Sanofi (“Weil”). Following the meeting DLA Piper distributed
the draft merger agreement and a draft exclusivity agreement to Weil.
On August 24, 2021, the Company and Sanofi entered into a 10-day exclusivity agreement that would be extended
automatically thereafter until the date either party informed the other it was no longer interested in pursuing a
transaction. Also on August 24, 2021, August 26, 2021, and August 30, 2021, representatives of the Company and
DLA Piper conducted due diligence meetings with representatives of Sanofi and Weil regarding the Company’s
intellectual property and upstream licenses.
On August 25 and 27, 2021, the Compensation Committee held a special meeting with representatives of DLA Piper

that the Company’s largest stockholder enter into a voting support agreement with respect to the transaction (the
“Support Agreement Requirement”), (ii) a Company termination fee equal to approximately 4% of the Company’s
equity value and (iii) that the Company make certain representations regarding compliance with the diligence
requirements of the upstream licenses relating to belumosudil and that Sanofi receive, prior to execution of the
Merger Agreement, certain written assurances from the stockholder representative of the parties to the upstream
licenses (the “Stockholder Representative”) regarding the reversion rights relating to the upstream licenses for
belumosudil (which we refer to as the “Upstream Licenses Assurances”).
From September 1, 2021 through September 3, 2021, representatives of the Company, DLA Piper, Sanofi, Weil, the
Company Financial Advisors and/or Centerview held several discussions regarding the Upstream Licenses
Assurances. In these meetings and calls, representatives of Sanofi and Weil informed the representatives of the
Company that Sanofi would not proceed with exploring a transaction without the Upstream License Assurances.
On September 1, 2021, DLA Piper distributed a revised draft of the merger agreement, which did not include any
Support Agreement Requirement or obligation to obtain any pre-execution Upstream Licenses Assurances and
provided for a Company termination fee equal to approximately 3% of the Company’s equity value.
On September 2, 2021, representatives of the Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Moss and Mr. Meehan,
representatives of Sanofi, representatives of DLA Piper and Weil, and representatives of Moelis, Cantor Fitzgerald
and Centerview held a virtual due diligence meeting with the Stockholder Representative, during which Sanofi
requested an acknowledgement from the Stockholder Representative that the Company had complied with its
obligations under the upstream licenses. Following the meeting, the Company distributed a draft acknowledgement to
the Stockholder Representative.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 2, 2021, the Transaction Committee held a virtual special meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss,
Mr. Carver and representatives of DLA Piper, during which meeting the management and representatives of DLA
Piper updated the Transaction Committee on the status of negotiations with Sanofi. In addition, representatives of
DLA Piper reviewed with the Board of Directors remaining open issues on the draft Merger Agreement (the latest
draft of which was distributed to the Transaction Committee in advance of the meeting), which included, in addition
to the Upstream License Assurances and related Company representations, (i) the size of the termination fee the
Company would have to pay in order to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or for the
Board of Directors to change its recommendation and (ii) the Support Agreement Requirement.
On September 3, 2021, Weil distributed a revised draft of the Merger Agreement without the Support Agreement
Requirement. Also, on September 3, 2021, the Company distributed a draft of the Company’s disclosure letter.

On September 6, 2021, the Board of Directors held a special meeting attended by all the directors, and Mr. Meehan,
Mr. Moss and Mr. Carver and representatives of Cantor Fitzgerald, Moelis and DLA Piper. A representative of DLA
Piper reviewed with the Board of Directors the status of negotiations with Sanofi and the terms of the proposed
Merger Agreement and related transaction documents. A representative of Moelis then reviewed with the Board of

analysis of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock of the Company in the Merger.
A representative of Cantor Fitzgerald then reviewed with the Board of Directors, based upon materials provided to
the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting, Cantor Fitzgerald’s financial analysis of the Merger Consideration

analysis of each of the Company Financial Advisors and asked questions of the Company Financial Advisors
regarding such analyses. The Board of Directors then further discussed and considered the proposed transaction,
including the potential benefits of, and risks related to, the transaction and the Company’s standalone prospects as
described in more detail below under “Reasons for the Merger,” and the remaining issue under negotiation, the scope
of the representations of the Company regarding the upstream licenses. The Board of Directors then met in executive
session, without management present, and discussed and approved, subject to the Board of Directors’ approval of
the Merger, (a) changes to the Employment Agreements and compensation arrangements of Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan
and Mr. Moss, and (b) transaction bonuses payable to certain other employees, contingent upon consummation of
the Merger and continued employment through such time. The Board of Directors instructed the Company’s
management and DLA Piper to engage with Sanofi and its counsel to finalize the remaining issues in the Merger
Agreement and reconvene the Board of Directors the following day. Also on September 6, the Company received a
letter from the Stockholder Representative acknowledging, among other things, that the Company had complied with
its obligations under the upstream licenses relating to belumosudil, a copy of which was provided to Sanofi.
On the afternoon of September 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a special meeting attended by all the directors, Mr.
Meehan, Mr. Moss, and Mr. Carver and representatives of Cantor Fitzgerald, Moelis and DLA Piper. Mr. Moss and a

Merger Agreement (the draft of which was provided to the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting). Each of
Moelis and Cantor Fitzgerald was asked to confirm that there were no changes to the analysis presented to the Board
of Directors the previous day. After further discussion, representatives of Moelis rendered an oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing on September 7, 2021, to the Board of Directors that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations set forth therein, the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share to be received in the Merger
by holders of Common Stock, other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded Shares, pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of
Moelis, dated September 7, 2021, is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is described in more detail below
under “Opinions of the Company Financial Advisors-Opinion of Moelis & Company LLC.” Representatives of

stockholders, and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement and
approve the Merger.
On the afternoon of September 7, 2021, the Company and Sanofi executed the Merger Agreement and on the morning

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii)
resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger, and
(iv) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s stockholders for their adoption. The Board
of Directors made its determination after consultation with its legal and financial advisors and consideration of a
number of factors. For some of the factors considered, see “The Merger-Reasons for Recommendation.”
In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, yours. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the
Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company. See under
the heading “The Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the Merger Proposal and “FOR” approval of
the Adjournment Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
the Board of Directors consulted with the Company’s senior management, as well as representatives of its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel. In the course of making its determination (1) that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and its stockholders and (2) to recommend that the Board of Directors approve and declare advisable
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the Board
of Directors considered numerous factors, including the following non-exhaustive list of material factors and benefits
of the Merger, each of which the Board of Directors believed supported its determination and recommendation:
Common Stock Merger Consideration. The Board of Directors considered:
•
the current and historical market prices of the Common Stock, including the performance of the Common
Stock relative to other participants in the Company’s industry;
•
the fact that the Common Stock Merger Consideration represented a premium value for the Company’s
stockholders, including a premium of 79% over the closing price on September 7, 2021 and a premium of
approximately 113% over the volume weighted average price for the 60 trading days prior to such date; and
•
the trading history of the Company and the offer price relative to such history.
Business and Financial Condition. The Board of Directors considered the Company’s historical and projected
business, industry, markets, financial performance and condition and its prospects.
29TABLE OF CONTENTS
Risks and Uncertainties. The Board of Directors considered, among other factors, that the Company’s business and
that its stockholders would continue to be subject to significant risks and uncertainties if the Company remained an
independent public company, including:
•
that the achievement of the Company’s standalone plan has been and would continue to be subject to
numerous risks and uncertainties, including those related to the regulatory approval and market acceptance
of the Company’s product pipeline and the cost and complexity associated with globally commercializing
REZUROCKTM (belumosudil);
•
the pace and magnitude of on-going changes in the markets in which the Company operates and competes;
•
that changes to U.S. legislative, FDA or global regulations may make it more difficult for us to obtain
regulatory approval of the Company’s products and/or manufacture its products;
•
that the Company’s revenue depends in part upon a limited number of direct customers and strategic
partners;
•
that the Company faces both business disruption risks and opportunities related to the COVID-19
pandemic and that developments with respect to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccinations, the
onset of additional outbreaks and changing regulatory priorities are difficult to predict and could have an
adverse effect on its business;
•
that if the Company’s products contribute to a death or a serious injury, it can result in voluntary corrective
actions or agency enforcement actions;
•
that developing, introducing and growing the Company’s new products and services requires long-term
and strategic investments, and the significant risks that these products and services will not be successful
or realize favorable returns;
•
the difficulties for the Company to accurately forecast demand for its products and overall Company
performance in light of these and other risks and uncertainties;
•
the uncertainty of whether future trading values would reach the Common Stock Merger Consideration as
compared to the certainty of realizing a compelling value for shares of Common Stock in the Merger; and
•
the risks set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2020 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
The Sale Process. The Board of Directors considered:
•
that after receiving the initial indication of interest from Sanofi, the Board of Directors commenced a sale
process and considered each of the strategic acquirers it believed most likely and capable of acquiring the
Company;
•
that representatives of the Company, including through the Company Financial Advisors, had contact with
nine potential strategic acquirers regarding their potential interest in acquiring the Company and that three
of the nine expressed an interest in such discussions, entered into confidentiality agreements with the
Company and were granted further access to the Company;
•
that of the three potential strategic acquirers that engaged in discussion regarding a potential acquisition
of the Company, only one, Sanofi, made a final offer to acquire the Company and that the Company would
risk losing the opportunity with Sanofi in the event the Company sought to continue discussions with
such third parties or pursue discussions with additional third parties prior to entry into the Merger
Agreement;
•
that Sanofi increased the price per share of Common Stock it was willing to pay from $7.00 to $9.50 in the
course of their negotiations with the Company;
•
the adequacy and results of the Company’s process of exploring strategic alternatives and the Board of
Directors’ belief that the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share represents the highest
price reasonably obtainable; and
•
that the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share was the only final offer received at the
conclusion of the Company’s process of exploring strategic alternatives.
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Negotiation Process. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement were the
result of robust arm’s-length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge and at the direction of the
Board of Directors, and with the assistance of independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel.
Cantor Fitzgerald’s Financial Analysis. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis of the Common
Stock Merger Consideration that Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed with the Board of Directors on September 6, 2021,
including Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion rendered to the Board of Directors on September 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations, conditions and
qualifications described in its opinion, the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by
holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates) was fair from a financial
point of view to such holders. For a description of Cantor Fitzgerald's opinion, please see below under “-Opinions of
the Company Financial Advisors-Opinion of Cantor Fitzgerald.” The written opinion delivered by Cantor Fitzgerald is
attached hereto as Annex C.
Moelis’s Financial Analysis. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration that Moelis reviewed with the Board of Directors on September 6, 2021, including Moelis’ opinion
rendered to the Board of Directors on September 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations
set forth therein, the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share to be received in the Merger by holders
of Common Stock, other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded Shares, pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a description of the Moelis’ opinion, please
see below under “-Opinions of the Company Financial Advisors-Opinion of Moelis & Company LLC”. The written
opinion delivered by Moelis is attached hereto as Annex D.
Certainty of Consideration. The Board of Directors considered that the all-cash nature of the consideration to be
paid in the Merger allows Company stockholders to realize immediate and certain premium cash value and liquidity,
while avoiding the significant future risks and uncertainties for the Company and the markets generally.
Company Projections. The Board of Directors considered Company Projections, which reflect an application of
various assumptions of the Company’s senior management. The Board of Directors considered the inherent
uncertainty of attaining management’s forecasts, including those set forth in “-Company Projections,” and that due
to such uncertainty the Company’s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially from management’s
forecasted results.
Likelihood of Completion; Certainty of Payment. The Board of Directors considered its belief that, absent a superior
proposal, the Merger represented a transaction that would likely be consummated based on, among other factors:
•
the absence of any financing condition to the consummation of the Merger;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement requires Sanofi to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain applicable
regulatory approvals to consummate the Merger as further described below under the heading “The
Merger Agreement-Regulatory Approvals;”
•
the exceptions contained within the “Company Material Adverse Effect” definition, which generally defines
the standard for closing risk;
•
the fact that the conditions to the closing of the Merger are specific and limited in scope; and
•
the Company’s ability to request that the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the County of New Castle,
Delaware) specifically enforce the Merger Agreement, including the consummation of the Merger, under
certain circumstances described in “The Merger Agreement-Specific Performance.”
Other Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors considered other terms of the Merger Agreement,
which are more fully described below under the heading “The Merger Agreement.” Certain provisions of the Merger
Agreement that the Board of Directors considered significant include:
•
Ability to Respond to Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals. Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement
by the Company’s stockholders, the Company may provide confidential information and/or engage in
discussions or negotiations in connection with a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal (as
more
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
fully described below under the headings “The Merger Agreement-Change in Recommendation or
Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a
superior proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal and that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to certain
notice requirements in favor of Sanofi and the entry into an acceptable confidentiality agreement with the
unsolicited bidder;
•
Change in Recommendation in Response to a Superior Proposal. The ability of the Company to terminate
the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, subject to Sanofi’s ability to match such
superior proposal and subject to paying Sanofi a termination fee of approximately $60.125 million and the
other conditions of the Merger Agreement (as more fully described below under the heading “The Merger
Agreement-Termination Fee”);
•
Company Termination Fee. The fact that the termination fee described above is approximately 3.25% of the
purchase price of the Company, which amount the Board of Directors believed was reasonable in light of,
among other things, the typical size of such termination fees in similar transactions, the benefits of the
Merger to the Company’s stockholders, the likelihood that a fee of such size would not be preclusive of
other offers and that the Company had concluded a process to explore strategic alternatives prior to
entering into the Merger Agreement;
•
Termination Date. The fact that the Termination Date under the Merger Agreement on which either party,
subject to certain exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement allows for sufficient time to consummate
the Merger, while minimizing the length of time during which the Company would be required to operate
subject to the restrictions on interim operations set forth in the Merger Agreement; and
•
Appraisal Rights. The availability of statutory appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger.
The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors in its
deliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including
the following:
•
No Participation in the Company’s Future. The Board of Directors considered that if the Merger is
consummated, Company stockholders will receive the Merger Consideration in cash and will no longer
have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company or benefit from any
potential future appreciation in the value of Company shares, including any value that could be achieved if
the Company engages in future strategic or other transactions;
•
Non-Solicitation Covenant. The Board of Directors considered that the Merger Agreement imposes
restrictions on the Company’s solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties. However, based upon
the process to review strategic alternatives described above in “-Background of the Merger,” and the fact
that the most likely potential acquirers of the Company were contacted during such process, the Board of
Directors believed it had a strong basis for determining that the Merger was the best transaction
reasonably likely to be available to the Company;
•
Termination Fee. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Company must pay Sanofi a
termination fee of approximately $60.125 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances, including to accept a superior proposal;
•
Interim Operating Covenants. The Board of Directors considered that the Merger Agreement imposes
restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, requiring
the Company and its subsidiaries to (A) ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries conduct its and their
respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects; (B) use
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its and their respective current business organizations,
keep available the services of its and their respective current officers and employees and maintain its and
their respective relations and goodwill with material customers, suppliers, landlords, governmental
authorities and other persons having material business relationships with the Company or its subsidiaries;
and (C) keep in full force and effect all appropriate insurance policies covering all material assets of the
Company;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Risks the Merger May Not Be Completed. The Board of Directors considered the risk that the conditions to
the Merger may not be satisfied and that, therefore, the Merger would not be consummated. The Board of
Directors also considered the risks and costs to the Company if the Merger is not consummated, including
the diversion of management and employee attention, potential employee attrition, the potential effect on
the Company’s business operations, including its relationships with vendors, distributors, customers,
partners and others that do business with the Company, and the potential effect on the trading price of
Company shares;
•
Potential Conflicts of Interest. The Board of Directors considered that the Company’s executive officers
and directors have financial interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including
the Merger, that may be different from or in addition to those of other stockholders, as more fully described
under the heading “-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger;”
•
Tax Treatment. The Board of Directors considered that the receipt of the Merger Consideration will
generally be taxable to stockholders of the Company; and
•
Impact on Stakeholders. The Board of Directors considered the potential impact of the Merger on
employees, customers, partners and communities, to the extent they may have an impact on the Company,
and the risks of not closing in a timely manner (including, but not limited to, costs, attrition and disruption
of the Company’s workforce).
The foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes material factors considered by the Board of
Directors in its consideration of the Merger. After considering these and other factors, the Board of Directors
concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In view of the variety of
factors considered by the Board of Directors and the complexity of these factors, the Board of Directors did not find
it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its
determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board of Directors applied his or her own
personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors. Upon due
consideration of these and other factors, the Board of Directors believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the
Merger to the Company’s stockholders outweighed the risks and uncertainties of the Merger and adopted and
approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
recommends that stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger based upon the totality of the
information presented to and considered by the Board of Directors.

Opinion of Cantor Fitzgerald
The Company retained Cantor Fitzgerald to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. In connection
with the Merger, Cantor Fitzgerald rendered its opinion to the Board of Directors on September 7, 2021, to the effect
that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations, conditions
and qualifications described in its opinion, the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by
holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates) was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by Cantor Fitzgerald. This opinion is attached as Annex C and is
incorporated herein by reference. Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion was provided for the benefit and use of the Board of
Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger. Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion
did not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors in connection with the Merger, nor did the opinion
constitute a recommendation to any holders of Common Stock should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any
related matter. Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion did not address the Company’s underlying business decision to pursue
the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or financial strategies that
might exist for the Company or the effects of any other transaction in which the Company might engage. The
following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion.
In the course of performing its reviews and analyses for rendering its opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald:
•
reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated September 7, 2021;
33TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
reviewed the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, its Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, and its Current Reports on
Form 8-K filed since December 31, 2020;
•
reviewed certain operating and financial information relating to the Company’s business and prospects,
including projections for the Company for the 14 years ended December 31, 2034, all as prepared and
provided to Cantor Fitzgerald by the Company’s management;
•
met with certain members of the Company’s senior management to discuss the Company’s business,
operations, historical and projected financial results and future prospects;
•
reviewed the historical prices and trading volume of the Common Stock;
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial data, stock market performance data and trading multiples of
companies which Cantor Fitzgerald deemed generally comparable to the Company;
•
reviewed the terms of certain relevant mergers and acquisitions involving companies which Cantor
Fitzgerald deemed generally comparable to the Company;
•
performed a discounted cash flow analysis based on the projections for the Company furnished to Cantor
Fitzgerald by the Company’s management; and
•
conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Cantor Fitzgerald deemed
appropriate.
Cantor Fitzgerald relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information provided to or discussed with Cantor Fitzgerald by the Company or obtained by
Cantor Fitzgerald from public sources, including, without limitation, the projections referred to above. With respect to
the projections, Cantor Fitzgerald relied on representations that they have been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the Company’s senior management as to the
expected future performance of the Company. Cantor Fitzgerald did not assume any responsibility for the
independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any such information, including, without limitation, the
projections; Cantor Fitzgerald expressed no view or opinion as to such projections or the assumptions upon which
they were based; and Cantor Fitzgerald further relied upon the assurances of the Company’s senior management that
it was unaware of any facts that would make the information or projections incomplete or misleading. Cantor
Fitzgerald assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft
reviewed by Cantor Fitzgerald.
In arriving at its opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor was Cantor Fitzgerald furnished with any such appraisals.
Cantor Fitzgerald was asked by the Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest from various third parties
regarding a transaction with the Company, and considered the results of such solicitation in rendering its opinion.
Cantor Fitzgerald assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement without any limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory
or otherwise, that would be material in any respect to its analysis or its opinion. Cantor Fitzgerald is not a legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting expert and relied on the assessments made by the Company and its advisors with
respect to such issues. Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion did not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
It was understood that Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion was intended for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors (in
its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger, and may not be used for any other purpose,
reproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to at any time, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent
of Cantor Fitzgerald. However, Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion may be included in its entirety in this proxy statement.
Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors in connection with the
Merger, nor did the opinion constitute a recommendation to any holders of Common Stock should vote or act with
respect to the Merger or any related matter. Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion did not address the Company’s underlying
business decision to pursue the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or
financial strategies that might exist for the Company or the effects of any other transaction in which the Company
might engage. Cantor Fitzgerald did not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of
Common Stock might trade subsequent to the announcement of the Merger. Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion only
addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
affiliates) of the Common Stock Merger Consideration and did not address any other term, aspect or implication of
the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. In addition, Cantor Fitzgerald did not
express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation
payable to or to be received by any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,
in connection with the Merger relative to the Common Stock Merger Consideration or otherwise.
Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion was authorized for issuance by Cantor Fitzgerald’s Fairness Opinion and Valuation
Committee. Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion was subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other
conditions contained therein and was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions, and the
information made available to Cantor Fitzgerald, as of the date of its opinion. Cantor Fitzgerald assumed no
responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date of
Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion to the Board of Directors, Cantor Fitzgerald performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses, which are summarized below. The following summary is not a complete description of all
analyses performed and factors considered by Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. With respect to the selected companies and selected precedent transactions
analyses summarized below, no company or transaction used as a comparison was identical to the Company or the
Merger. These analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or acquisition values of the companies
concerned. For purposes of the analyses described below, implied multiples for selected companies and selected
transactions that were considered not meaningful or were not publicly available were not included in the high, mean,
median and low multiples for the selected companies and the selected transactions.
Cantor Fitzgerald believes that its analyses and the summary below must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
processes underlying Cantor Fitzgerald’s analyses and opinion. Cantor Fitzgerald did not draw, in isolation,
conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion, but rather arrived
at its ultimate opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole.
The estimates of the future performance of the Company in or underlying Cantor Fitzgerald’s analyses are not
necessarily indicative of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
estimates. In performing its analyses, Cantor Fitzgerald considered industry performance, general business and
economic conditions and other matters, many of which were beyond the control of the Company. Estimates of the
financial value of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or
securities actually may be sold or acquired.
The Common Stock Merger Consideration was determined through negotiation between the Company and Sanofi,
and the decision by the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors.
Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board of
Directors in its evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board of
Directors or the Company’s management with respect to the Merger or the consideration payable in the Merger.
The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with
its opinion. The order in which such summary is presented does not represent the relative importance of such
analyses. In addition, the financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand Cantor Fitzgerald’s financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the
data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies
and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Cantor Fitzgerald’s
financial analyses.
In the financial analyses summarized below, financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available
research analysts’ estimates, public filings and other publicly available information, financial data of the selected
transactions were based on public filings and other publicly available information, and financial data of the Company
were based on internal estimates of the Company’s management provided to Cantor Fitzgerald.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Companies Analysis. Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed selected financial and stock market data of the Company
and ten selected publicly traded late-stage rare disease biopharmaceutical companies (the “selected companies”).
Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed enterprise values of the selected companies, calculated as fully diluted equity values
based on closing stock prices on September 3, 2021, less cash, plus debt, plus non-controlling interest, plus preferred
equity, plus other contingent liabilities, as multiples of calendar year 2026 estimated revenue (“2026E Revenue”),
which ranged from 0.42x to 4.67x. The mean and median revenue multiples observed in this analysis for the selected
companies were 1.69x and 1.26x, respectively.
The selected companies and the financial data reviewed included the following:
Selected Public Companies
Enterprise Value / 2026E Revenue Multiple
Albireo Pharma, Inc.
0.67x
Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
4.67x
Calliditas Therapeutics AB
0.89x
ChemoCentryx, Inc.
1.14x
Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated

1.37x
Insmed Incorporated
1.92x
Omeros Corporation
1.82x
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
0.42x
Zogenix, Inc.
1.05x
Cantor Fitzgerald then applied a selected range of 2026E revenue multiples of 1.00x to 3.00x, derived from the selected
companies, to corresponding data of the Company. Cantor Fitzgerald then adjusted for the Company’s estimated
cash, debt, convertible preferred stock and other liabilities, and divided by the number of fully-diluted shares of
Common Stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money
options) as of September 3, 2021. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for the
Company of approximately $2.73 to $7.27, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial
information for ten selected transactions which involved late-stage rare disease biopharmaceutical target companies.
Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed enterprise values of the selected transactions, calculated as the purchase prices paid for
the target companies’ equity (excluding contingent consideration, if any), less cash, plus debt, plus non-controlling
interest, plus preferred equity, plus other contingent liabilities, on a standalone basis and as a multiple of estimated
revenue for the calendar year approximately five years after the date each transaction was announced (“Estimated 5-
Year Forward Revenue”).
The enterprise values of the selected transactions observed in this analysis ranged from $834 million to $3,365 million,
and the mean and median enterprise values were $1,743 million and $1,465 million, respectively. The enterprise values
of the selected transactions as a multiple of Estimated 5-Year Forward Revenue after the date each transaction was
announced ranged from 1.67x to 6.73x, and the mean and median enterprise values as a multiple of Estimated 5-Year
Forward Revenue were 3.02x and 2.43x, respectively.

Cantor Fitzgerald applied a selected range of enterprise values of $1,250 million to $2,000 million, derived from the
selected transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald then adjusted for the Company’s estimated cash, debt, convertible preferred
stock and other liabilities, and divided by the number of fully-diluted shares of Common Stock (determined using the
treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options) as of September 3, 2021. This
analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range for the Company of approximately $6.66 to
$10.25, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50.
Cantor Fitzgerald also applied a selected range of 2026E revenue multiples of 2.25x to 4.25x, derived from the selected
transactions, to the Company’s 2026E revenue, based on internal estimates of the Company’s management. Cantor
Fitzgerald then adjusted for the Company’s estimated cash, debt, convertible preferred stock and other liabilities, and
divided by the number of fully-diluted shares of Common Stock (determined using the treasury stock method and
taking into account outstanding in-the-money options) as of September 3, 2021. This analysis indicated an
approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for the Company of $5.63 to $10.01, as compared to the
Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Cantor Fitzgerald performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based
on internal estimates provided by the Company’s management and Cantor Fitzgerald’s calculation of probability of
success adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows set forth in “-Company Projections”.
In performing this analysis, Cantor Fitzgerald calculated a range of equity values for the Common Stock by (a)
discounting to present value using discount rates ranging from 9.5% to 11.5% (reflecting the Company’s estimated
weighted average cost of capital, which was derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a size premium) and
the mid-year convention: (i) the forecasted probability of success adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of the
Company over the period beginning on October 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2034, utilized by Cantor
Fitzgerald as set forth in “-Company Projections” and (ii) an implied terminal value of the Company, calculated
assuming that the Company’s after-tax unlevered free cash flows would decline in perpetuity after December 31, 2034
at a range of rates of 60% to 10% year-over-year, and (b) adjusting for (1) the Company’s estimated cash, debt,
convertible preferred stock and other liabilities and (2) the estimated value of the Company’s early-stage oncology
platform based on a select set of companies.
For purposes of estimating the value of the Company’s early-stage oncology platform, Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed
selected financial and stock market data of seven selected early-stage immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical
companies (the “selected immuno-oncology companies”).
Cantor Fitzgerald reviewed enterprise values of the selected immuno-oncology companies, calculated as fully diluted
equity values based on closing stock prices on September 3, 2021, less cash, plus debt, plus non-controlling interest,
plus preferred equity, plus other contingent liabilities. The enterprise values of the selected immuno-oncology
companies observed in this analysis ranged from $25 million to $350 million, and the mean and median enterprise
values were $237 million and $281 million, respectively.

Based on its analysis of the selected immuno-oncology companies, Cantor Fitzgerald included a selected enterprise
value of $200 million for the Company’s oncology platform.
Using the sum of the estimated valuations summarized above, Cantor Fitzgerald then divided by the number of fully-
diluted shares of Common Stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding
in-the-money options) as of September 3, 2021. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference
range for the Company of approximately $8.33 to $11.99, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of
$9.50.
Other Information. In rendering its opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald also reviewed and considered the historical trading
prices of Common Stock during the one-year period ended September 3, 2021, which reflected low and high closing
prices for Common Stock during such period of $3.15 and $5.73, respectively.
Miscellaneous
The Board of Directors selected Cantor Fitzgerald as one of the Company Financial Advisors in connection with the
Merger based on Cantor Fitzgerald’s reputation as a leading global provider of advisory and capital markets services,
experience in the life sciences industry and expertise in mergers and acquisitions, as well as its familiarity with the
Company.
Cantor Fitzgerald has acted as a financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a
fee, based upon a percentage of the transaction value of the Merger, of approximately $15 million, $1.5 million of
which was payable upon delivery of Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion to the Board of Directors and the remaining balance
of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify
Cantor Fitzgerald against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two years preceding the date of Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald has provided certain
investment banking and other services to the Company on matters unrelated to the Merger, including acting as the
placement agent for the Company’s ongoing at-the-market offering program, acting as the sole bookrunner for the
Company’s private offering of the Convertible Notes in February 2021, executing two block trades on behalf of the
Company in October 2019 and May 2020, and acting as the joint bookrunner for the Company’s public offering of
Common Stock in November 2019, for which it has received aggregate fees of approximately $6.5 million. During the
two years preceding the date of Cantor Fitzgerald’s opinion, Cantor Fitzgerald has not provided any financial
advisory or other investment banking services to Sanofi for which Cantor Fitzgerald has received fees.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Cantor Fitzgerald has adopted certain policies and
procedures to establish and maintain the independence of Cantor Fitzgerald’s research departments and personnel.
As a result, Cantor Fitzgerald’s research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations
and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company, Sanofi, the Merger and other participants in the Merger
that differ from the views of Cantor Fitzgerald’s investment banking personnel.
Cantor Fitzgerald may seek to provide the Company and Sanofi and their respective affiliates with certain investment
banking and other services unrelated to the Merger in the future. In the ordinary course of business, Cantor
Fitzgerald and its affiliates may actively trade (for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers) certain
equity and debt securities, bank debt and/or other financial instruments issued by the Company and/or Sanofi and
their respective affiliates, as well as derivatives thereof, and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short
positions in such securities, bank debt, financial instruments and derivatives.

At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on September 7, 2021 to evaluate and approve the Merger, Moelis
rendered its oral opinion to the Board of Directors, confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion dated September 7,
2021, addressed to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken,
the Common Stock Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of Common Stock (other than
Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded Shares) was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of Moelis’ written opinion dated September 7, 2021, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. Moelis’ opinion was provided
for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors (solely in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the Merger.
Moelis’ opinion is limited solely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of
Excluded Shares) in the Merger and does not address the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the
Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that
might be available to the Company. Moelis’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of
securities should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Moelis’ opinion was approved by a
Moelis fairness opinion committee.
In arriving at its opinion, Moelis, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company, including
publicly available research analysts’ financial forecasts;
•
reviewed certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and
prospects of the Company furnished to Moelis by the Company, including financial forecasts provided to
or discussed with Moelis by the management of the Company (as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “-Company Projections”) (such forecasts referred to herein as the “Financial
Forecasts”);
•
reviewed certain information regarding the capitalization of the Company provided by the management of
the Company;
•
conducted discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the Company
concerning the information described in the foregoing three bullets, as well as the business and prospects
of the Company generally;
•
reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines of business
that Moelis deemed relevant;
•
considered the results of efforts by or on behalf of the Company, including by Moelis at the Company’s
direction, to solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of all or a
portion of the Company;
•
reviewed the financial terms of certain other transactions that Moelis deemed relevant;
•
reviewed a draft, dated September 7, 2021, of the Merger Agreement;
•
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and Sanofi and
their advisors; and
•
conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as
Moelis deemed appropriate.
In connection with its review, with the consent of the Board of Directors, Moelis relied on the information supplied
to, discussed with or reviewed by it for purposes of its opinion being complete and accurate in all material respects.
Moelis did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any of
such information. With the consent of the Board of Directors, Moelis relied upon, without independent verification,
the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax,
regulatory and accounting matters. With respect to the Financial Forecasts, Moelis assumed, at the direction of the
Board of Directors, that they were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
available estimates and judgments of the Company’s management as to the future performance of the Company. In
addition, with the consent of the Board of Directors, Moelis relied on the assessments of the management of the
Company as to the existing pharmaceutical products then under development by the Company and the validity of,
and risks associated with, the then existing and future products of the Company, including the risks and timing of
regulatory approvals and commercialization of such products. Moelis expressed no view as to the reasonableness of
the Financial Forecasts and other financial forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, with
the consent of the Board of Directors, Moelis did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of the Company, nor was Moelis
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.
Moelis’ opinion did not address the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Merger or the relative
merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the
Company and did not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. At the direction of the Board of
Directors, Moelis was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion as to any terms of the Merger Agreement or any
aspect or implication of the Merger, except for the fairness of the Common Stock Merger Consideration from a
financial point of view to the holders of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded
Shares). Moelis did not express any opinion as to fair value or the solvency of the Company following the closing of
the Merger. Moelis noted that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Excluded Shares will not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and Moelis expressed no opinion with respect to such shares or as to the
fairness of the Merger Consideration to holders thereof. In addition, Moelis expressed no opinion with respect to the
treatment of the Preferred Stock in the Transaction, or the fairness of the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
relative to the treatment of such Preferred Stock. In rendering its opinion, Moelis assumed, with the consent of the
Board of Directors, that the final executed form of the Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from
the draft that Moelis reviewed, that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms without any
waiver or modification that could be material to Moelis’ analysis, that the representations and warranties of each
party contained in the Merger Agreement were true and correct and that the parties to the Merger Agreement would
comply with all the material terms of the Merger Agreement. Moelis assumed, with the consent of the Board of
Directors, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents or approvals necessary for the completion of the
Merger would be obtained, except to the extent that could not be material to Moelis’ analysis.
Moelis’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Moelis as of, the date of its opinion, and Moelis assumed no responsibility to update
its opinion for developments after the date of its opinion.
Moelis’ opinion did not address the fairness of the Merger or any aspect or implication of the Merger to, or any other
consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the
Company, other than the fairness of the Common Stock Merger Consideration from a financial point of view to the
holders of Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates and holders of Excluded Shares). In addition, Moelis did
not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any
officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise. Moelis’ opinion was approved by a Moelis fairness opinion committee.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared by Moelis for the Board of Directors in
connection with rendering its written opinion, dated September 7, 2021. Some of the summaries of financial analyses

purposes of, among other things, deriving per share implied equity values for the Company, Moelis calculated certain
per share amounts for the Company based on diluted shares outstanding as of September 3, 2021 provided by
Company management and approved for use by Moelis in rendering its opinion.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of its analyses, Moelis reviewed a number of financial metrics, including the following:
•
EBIT: generally calculated as the relevant company’s earnings before interest and taxes, as adjusted to
exclude one-time charges and benefits and to reflect the full-year impact of material corporate transactions.
•
Total Enterprise Value (“TEV”): which (i) with respect to the Company, was calculated as the market value of
the Company’s fully diluted common equity based on its closing stock prices on September 2, 2021 and
share count information as of September 3, 2021 provided by the Company management and approved by
Company management for use by Moelis in rendering its opinion, plus (a) the Preferred Stock, plus (b) the
Convertible Notes, less (c) cash and cash equivalents, and (ii) with respect to other companies, was
calculated as the market value of the relevant company’s fully diluted common equity based on its closing
stock price as of September 2, 2021, plus (a) preferred stock, plus (b) debt, less (c) cash and cash
equivalents (in each of the foregoing clauses (a) through (c), as of the relevant company’s most recently
reported quarter end).
Unless the context indicates otherwise, (i) the estimates of the future financial performance for the selected publicly
traded companies listed below were based on certain publicly available research analyst estimates for those
companies, and (ii) the estimates of the future financial performance of the Company relied upon for the financial
analyses described below were based on the Financial Forecasts.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Moelis performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company using the Financial Forecasts and other
information and data provided by the Company’s management to calculate the present value of the estimated future
probability-adjusted unlevered after-tax free cash flows projected to be generated by the Company and the present
value of the Company’s estimated terminal value, taking into account the estimated December 31, 2021 cash balance
(net of debt) and the present value of the Company’s federal and state net operating losses and federal research and
development tax credits.
Moelis utilized a range of discount rates of 8.25% to 10.75% based on an estimated range of the Company’s weighted
average cost of capital (“WACC”). The estimated WACC range was derived using the Capital Assets Pricing Model
and a size premium. Moelis used the foregoing range of discount rates to calculate the present values as of December
31, 2021 of (i) the Company’s estimated after-tax unlevered free cash flows for calendar years 2022 through 2034 (in
each case, discounted using the mid-year discounting convention to a transaction date of December 31, 2021) and (ii)
the estimated terminal values derived by applying a perpetuity growth rate range of (75%) to (25%) to the Company’s
estimated terminal year after-tax unlevered free cash flow, which were added to the Company’s estimated December
31, 2021 net cash balance for purposes of determining equity and per share value.
Based on the foregoing, Moelis derived implied per share value ranges for the Common Stock of $8.50 to $12.21 per
share. Moelis compared the implied per share value range to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per
share.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis
Moelis conducted a sum-of-the-parts selected publicly traded companies analysis by separately reviewing financial
and stock market information relating to selected publicly traded companies that, in Moelis’ professional judgment,
have products similar to the Company’s KD025 product and its immuno-oncology platform. Based on its professional
judgment and experience, Moelis selected publicly traded companies which are (1) biopharma companies with a
single lead molecule that was recently approved or filed, targeting niche, specialty or orphan market opportunities
and that otherwise have assets with a similar technology profile to the Company’s lead product and deemed generally
relevant by Moelis in certain respects to the Company (such companies, the “KD025 Group”) or (2) platform immuno-
oncology companies in Phase 1 or earlier with a core technology focus on small molecule and/or antibody programs
and deemed generally relevant by Moelis in certain respects to the Company (the “IO Platform Group”). The
following table indicates the companies reviewed by Moelis with respect to each of these groups:
KD025 Group
IO Platform Group
Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Codiak BioSciences, Inc.
BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Cue Biopharma, Inc.
Calliditas Therapeutics
Fusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
ChemoCentryx, Inc.

Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.
Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc.
Insmed, Inc.
Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Omeros Corporation
Werewolf Therapeutics, Inc.
Pharming Group N.V.
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Financial data for the selected companies was based on publicly available consensus research analyst estimates,
public filings and other publicly available information and included, as appropriate, pro forma adjustments for
acquisitions and divestitures, unfunded pension liabilities or other corporate events, which are referred to
collectively as the “pro forma adjustments,” to the extent applicable. In the case of estimated TEV and 2026 Sales for
the Company, Moelis reviewed both median consensus research analyst estimates and the Financial Forecasts.
Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, the companies included were
selected because they are companies that, for purposes of analysis, had certain operational and financial
characteristics that may be considered reasonably comparable in certain respects to the Company.
Moelis reviewed, among other things, the TEV of each of the each of the companies in the KD025 Group, each
company in the KD025 Group’s median consensus estimates of sales for calendar year 2026 (“2026 Sales”) and the
TEV of each of the KD025 Group companies as a multiple of 2026 Sales. The following table summarizes the results of
the analysis of the selected companies in the KD025 Group:

In reviewing the characteristics of the selected publicly traded companies in the KD025 Group for purposes of
determining reference ranges to apply to the Company’s estimated financial metrics, Moelis noted that its estimate of
a range of total enterprise values for the Company’s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business was informed by a review
of the mean and median TEV of the KD025 Group and its estimate of a range of total TEV/2026 Sales multiples for the
Company’s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business was informed by a review of the TEV/2026 Sales multiples of each
company in the KD025 Group. While considered, Moelis did not utilize data for ChemoCentryx and Calliditas in its
determination of the TEV/2026 Sales multiple reference range because Moelis, in its professional judgment, assessed
that those companies had faced recent clinical development challenges which made them not comparable to the
Company. In addition, while considered, Moelis did not utilize data for BioCryst in its determination of the TEV/2026
Sales multiple reference range because Moelis, in its professional judgment, assessed that BioCryst’s multiple strong
quarters of commercial execution on ORLADEYO and robust pipeline made it not comparable to the Company. Based
on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected (i) a reference range for
estimated TEV/2026 Sales multiples for the Company’s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business of 1.50x to 2.25x and
(ii) a reference range of TEV for the Company’s KD025 asset as a stand-alone business of $1 billion to $2 billion.
In reviewing the characteristics of the selected publicly traded companies in the IO Platform Group for purposes of
determining its reference ranges to apply to the Company’s estimated financial metrics, Moelis noted that its estimate
of a range of total enterprise values for the Company’s IO Platform assets as a stand-alone business was informed by
a review of the mean and median TEV of each company in the IO Platform Group. Moelis further noted that certain
other platform immuno-oncology companies were excluded from the IO Platform Group because such companies have
multiple ongoing clinical programs or platform validating partnerships with larger pharmaceutical companies. Based
on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected a reference range of TEV for
the Company’s IO Platform assets as a stand-alone business of $175 million to $350 million.
Moelis then (i) applied the reference range for estimated TEV/2026 Sales multiples to the Company’s estimated 2026
Sales as set forth in the Company Projections to calculate an implied enterprise value for the Company’s KD025 asset
and (ii) added the reference range of enterprise value for the Company’s IO Platform assets on a stand-alone basis to
generate an implied TEV for the Company. This analysis indicated an implied per share value ranges for the Common
Stock of $4.73 to $7.25 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share value ranges to the Common Stock Merger
Consideration of $9.50 per share.
Moelis also (1) applied the reference range for the enterprise value of the Company’s KD025 asset as a stand-alone
business and (2) added the reference range of enterprise value for the Company’s IO Platform assets on a stand-alone
basis to generate an implied TEV for the Company. This analysis indicated an implied per share value ranges for the
Common Stock of $6.24 to $11.74 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share value ranges to the Common Stock
Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Moelis reviewed financial information for selected precedent transactions announced since 2015 involving acquired
companies that focused on niche or orphan market opportunities, that had its lead program in late-stage clinical trials
or approved and/or that had a lead asset with a similar technology profile to the Company’s lead asset, which Moelis
determined, in its professional judgment and experience, were generally relevant in certain respects to the Company
(the “Selected Precedent Transactions”). Moelis reviewed, among other things, transaction values of the Selected
Precedent Transactions and enterprise value as a multiple of CY+5 Sales for each Selected Precedent Transaction. For
purposes of this summary, “CY+5 Sales” means estimated sales amounts (i) for marketed companies, in the applicable
calendar year plus five years or (ii) for clinical-stage companies, assumed launch plus five years, in each case, based
on the public filings made by each of the acquired companies (with the exception of Clementia Pharmaceutical Inc.,
which is based on equity research estimates at the time of the transaction announcement) in connection with the
applicable Selected Precedent Transaction. Financial data for the relevant transactions were based on publicly
available information relating to the relevant transaction.
The Selected Precedent Transactions used in this analysis and their implied TEV to CY+5 Sales multiples are
summarized in the following table:

Total deal consideration of $1,300 million, of which $1,040 million upfront and $260 million milestone payments, adjusted for
approximately $170 million balance of cash and cash equivalents
In reviewing the characteristics of the Selected Precedent Transactions for purposes of selecting reference ranges of
TEV to apply to the Company’s estimated financial metrics, Moelis noted that its reference range was informed by the
Selected Precedent Transactions, other than the Sanofi/Principia transaction which had a transaction value at a
premium to other Selected Precedent Transactions due to the broad platform potential of Principia’s lead asset at the
time of acquisition. Moelis also noted that in reviewing the characteristics of the Selected Precedent Transactions for
purposes of selecting reference ranges of multiples to CY+5 Sales to apply to the Company’s estimated financial
metrics, Moelis’ reference range was informed by the Selected Precedent Transactions, other than the (i)
Horizon/Viela transaction since Viela was acquired at a premium due to its deep mid-stage biologics pipeline, and (ii)
BridgeBio/Eidos transaction since Eidos was acquired at a premium due to the value of its discovery platform.
Based on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected (i) a reference range
of 1.50x to 3.00x TEV / CY+5 Sales multiples and (ii) a reference range for the Company’s TEV of $1.5 billion to $2.5
billion. Moelis then applied the reference range for estimated CY+5 Sales multiples to the Company’s estimated 2026
Sales as set forth in the Financial Forecasts, which analysis indicated an implied per share value range for the
Common Stock of $3.85 to $7.23 per share. Moelis compared the implied per share value ranges to the Common Stock
Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share.
Moelis also applied the reference range for the Company’s implied enterprise value which analysis indicated an
implied per share value range for the Common Stock of $7.82 to $12.35 per share. Moelis compared the implied per
share value ranges to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Other Information
Moelis also noted for the Board of Directors the following additional factors that were not considered part of Moelis’
financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes: (i) the historic intraday
trading prices for the Common Stock during the 52-week period ended September 2, 2021, which reflected low and
high stock prices during such period of $3.15 and $5.73 per share, as compared to the Common Stock Merger
Consideration of $9.50 per share, (ii) the one-year forward stock price targets for the Common Stock in recently
published, publicly available equity research analysts’ reports, which indicated low and high stock price targets
ranging from $9.00 to $20.00 per share, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50 per share,
and (iii) an analysis of unaffected premiums paid since January 1, 2019 in 25 acquisitions in the biotech industry with
a transaction size in excess of $1 billion and excluding transactions in which the acquirer held an existing stake -
based on such premiums paid analysis, Moelis applied a reference range of premia from 60% to 80% to the
Company’s closing share price on September 2, 2021, which resulted in an implied low and high per share value range
for the Common Stock of $8.66 to $9.74 per share, as compared to the Common Stock Merger Consideration of $9.50
per share.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing is a summary of the analyses undertaken by Moelis in connection with Moelis’ opinion. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Moelis’ opinion. In arriving at its
fairness determination, Moelis considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight
to any factor or analysis. Rather, Moelis made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the
analyses described above is identical to the Company or the Merger. In addition, such analyses do not purport to be
appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses
based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because the analyses described above are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, neither the Company nor Moelis or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Sanofi and
was approved by the Board of Directors. Moelis did not recommend any specific consideration to the Company or
the Board of Directors, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the transaction. The Board of Directors selected Moelis as one of its financial advisors in
connection with the Merger based on Moelis’ reputation and experience. Moelis is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter
agreement dated August 13, 2021, Moelis acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger
and will receive a fee for its services, estimated to be approximately $15 million in the aggregate based on the
information available as of the date of announcement of the Merger, $1.5 million of which was earned in connection
with the delivery of Moelis’ opinion dated September 7, 2021, in connection with the Board of Directors’
consideration of the Merger, regardless of the conclusion reached therein, and the remainder of which is contingent
upon completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the Company has agreed to reimburse Moelis for certain expenses and
to indemnify Moelis for certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its
engagement.
Moelis’ affiliates, employees, officers and partners may at any time own securities (long or short) of the Company and
Sanofi. In the past two years, Moelis has not provided investment banking or other services to the Company or
Sanofi. Moelis may, in the future, provide investment banking or other services to the Company, Sanofi or other
parties involved in the Merger and would expect to receive compensation for such services.

The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose projections as to its future financial performance.
However, in connection with the strategic and financial review process as described in this proxy statement,
management prepared certain unaudited forecasts (the “Company Projections”), which were provided to and adopted
by the Board of Directors, and also provided to and, with the consent of the Board of Directors, relied upon by
Cantor
45TABLE OF CONTENTS
Fitzgerald and Moelis for use in connection with their respective financial analyses and fairness opinions, but were
not provided to parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company. The Company Projections included
prospective financial information for the Company on a standalone basis.
The Company Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement
only because the Company Projections were made available to Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis for use in connection
with their respective financial analyses and fairness opinions. The Company Projections were not prepared with a
view to compliance with (1) generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) or any other jurisdiction,
(2) the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements; or (3) the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any
other independent accountants, have audited, reviewed, compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with
respect to the Company Projections or expressed any opinion or given any form of assurance with respect thereto or
their achievability. The report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm incorporated by
reference relates to the Company’s historical audited financial information only and does not extend to the
prospective financial information and should not be read to do so. The summary of the Company Projections is
included solely to give stockholders of the Company access to certain financial projections that were made available
to, and relied upon by, the Board of Directors, Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis.
Although a summary of the Company Projections is presented with numerical specificity, the Company Projections
reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by the Company’s management that
management believed were reasonable at the time the Company Projections were prepared, taking into account the
relevant information available to the Company’s management at the time. However, this information should not be
relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results
and cause the Company Projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions, regulatory conditions,
financial market conditions, the Company’s ability to achieve forecasted sales, accuracy of certain accounting
assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax laws or accounting
treatment. The Company Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to
change. In addition, the Company Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after
the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the
Company Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the
Company Projections. The Company Projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes
less reliable with each successive year.
The inclusion of the Company Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the
Board of Directors, the Company, Cantor Fitzgerald, Moelis or any of their respective affiliates or representatives or
any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Company Projections to be predictive of
actual future results. The summary of the Company Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to
induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the
Special Meeting or for any other purpose. We do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Company Projections
to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the
event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Company Projections are shown to be in error or no longer
appropriate, except as otherwise required by law. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in
the Company Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the projections included in this
proxy statement.
None of the Company, Sanofi or any of their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has
made or makes any representation to any Company stockholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance
of the Company compared to the information contained in the Company Projections or that the Company Projections
will be achieved. The Company has made no representation to Sanofi or Merger Sub, in the Merger Agreement or
otherwise, concerning the Company Projections.
The Company Projections and the accompanying tables contain PoS (probability of success) adjusted net sales
revenue, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and unlevered free cash flow, each of which may be considered a
non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The Company
believes these measures are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. These
financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measure
and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP.
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company Projections include assumptions related to revenue, costs and cash flows:
•
The Company Projections contain revenue projections for REZUROCKTM (belumosudil) in chronic Graft-
Versus-Host-Disease (cGVHD), belumosudil in Systemic Sclerosis (SSC) and other revenues, which are
based on key revenue-related assumptions, including but not limited to: (1) product launch year, (2) patient
prevalence population growth and addressable patient percentage of prevalence, (3) peak market
penetration and time to achieve peak, (4) loss of exclusivity, and (5) pricing and reimbursement. In addition,
revenue for each of the Company’s programs was adjusted for PoS by multiplying management’s view of
the likelihood percentage of success by the revenue in each time period as follows: (1) 100% PoS for
REZUROCK-GVHD revenues in the United States, (2) 80% PoS for REZUROCK-GVHD revenues in non-US
markets, and (3) 15% PoS for belumosudil-SSC revenues globally. The Company Projections did not contain
revenue projections for the Company’s immune and fibrotic disease pipeline candidates, given the early
nature of such programs, or its immuno-oncology platform, as such platform was analyzed by each of
Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis separately, as directed by Company management, through selected public
companies and/or selected precedent transactions analysis (see “-Opinions of the Company Financial
Advisors”).
•
Key cost assumptions include assumptions related to cost of goods sold, sales and marketing costs, and
research and development costs. The resulting cost projections for each of the Company’s programs was
adjusted for the relevant in-phase PoS, if applicable. In addition, tax expense was estimated using a 26%
combined state and federal tax rate.
•
Key cash flow assumptions include assumptions related to capital expenditures, depreciation and
amortization and net working capital needs.
The following table summarizes the Company Projections. The Company Projections are forward-looking statements.
For information on factors that may cause the Company’s future results to materially vary, see the information under
the section captioned “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

We anticipate that the total funds needed by Sanofi and Merger Sub to (1) pay our stockholders and holders of
equity awards the amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement and (2) pay related fees and expenses in
connection with the Merger and associated transactions will be approximately $1.9 billion in the aggregate.
We believe Sanofi’s cash on hand will be sufficient to complete the Merger and pay related fees and expenses in
connection with the Merger and associates transactions and repay or refinance the outstanding indebtedness of the
Company that will be payable as a result of the Merger, but we cannot assure you of that. Those amounts may be
insufficient if, among other things, the fees, expenses or other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
Merger are greater than anticipated.
Each of Sanofi and Merger Sub have expressly acknowledged and agreed that the closing and the consummation of
the Merger is not conditioned on the availability of any financing arrangements.

after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption “The
Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”) (other than those conditions that by their terms are to

Promptly following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will send to each holder of record of shares of Common
Stock at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock
certificates and book-entry shares in exchange for the Common Stock Merger Consideration. Promptly following the
Effective Time, Sanofi will pay each holder of Preferred Stock the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration payable in
respect of their shares of Preferred Stock.
You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock
certificates to the Exchange Agent without a letter of transmittal.
If you are a holder of record of shares of Common Stock, you will not be entitled to receive the Common Stock
Merger Consideration until (1) any certificate representing such shares of Common Stock is surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal or (2) an “agent’s message” is received by
the Exchange Agent in respect of any such shares that are uncertificated and held in book-entry form.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if you have lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been
stolen or destroyed. If any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before you will be entitled
to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, you will have to make an affidavit of that fact claiming such
stock certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sanofi, post a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Sanofi may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such stock certificate.",56,56

In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the Merger, you should be aware that
executive officers and directors of the Company may have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from,
or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The Board of
Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters,
in evaluating the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the
Company.
Arrangements with Sanofi
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Sanofi or
any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving
Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger certain of our executive
officers may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Sanofi or Merger Sub or their respective affiliates
regarding employment with the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.
Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Executive Officers
The Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company
and its subsidiaries under any indemnification agreements existing as of the Agreement Date between the Company
or any of its subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers for a period of six years
following the Effective Time.
The Surviving Corporation will indemnify, defend and hold harmless current or former directors and officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or any
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement for a period of six years following the Effective Time. During
such six-year time period, Sanofi also will cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses for acts, errors, omissions and service prior to the Effective Time that are
49TABLE OF CONTENTS
at least as favorable to the current or former directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries as those set
forth in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ organizational documents as of the Agreement Date and will not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify these provisions in the organizational documents in any manner except as required by law.
The Merger Agreement also provides that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will purchase a six-year “tail”
policy and the Surviving Corporation will maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor the
obligations under the “tail” policy. This obligation is subject to an annual premium cap of 300% of the annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time. For more information see “The Merger Agreement-
Indemnification and Insurance.”

Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control
We have entered into employment agreements (“Employment Agreements”) with each of Harlan W. Waksal, M.D.,
Steven Meehan, and Gregory S. Moss, our executive officers. On September 7, 2021, in connection with the approval
of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board approved certain amendments to the
Employment Agreements. The following descriptions of the terms of the Employment Agreements, as amended, with
our executive officers are intended as a summary only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
employment agreements filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020,
which was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2021, and the amendments to the Employment Agreements that were filed
as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 8, 2021.
The Employment Agreements, as amended, provide for the payment of retention bonuses in the amount of $3,500,000
to Dr. Waksal, $1,000,000 to Mr. Meehan and $1,000,000 to Mr. Moss (the “Retention Bonuses”). The Retention
Bonuses were paid 25% on the date the Merger Agreement was fully executed and the remaining 75% will be earned
on the Closing Date, subject to the executive’s continuous and active employment with the Company through such
date unless his employment is terminated without Cause or he resigns with Good Reason (as such terms are defined
in the Employment Agreements, as amended) prior to such date.
The Employment Agreements, as amended, also provide for severance payments to Dr. Waksal and Messrs. Meehan
and Moss in the event the executive’s employment is terminated without Cause, or he resigns with Good Reason, in
either case during the three months prior to, as of, or within 12 months following the effective date of a Change in
Control (as defined in the executive’s employment agreement as amended). If Dr. Waksal’s employment is so
terminated, he will be entitled to receive severance in the form of a lump sum payment equal to 36 months’ base salary
plus the target bonus amount and continued healthcare coverage for 36 months. If Mr. Meehan’s or Mr. Moss’s
employment is so terminated, he will be entitled to receive severance in the form of a lump payment equal to 24
months’ base salary plus the target bonus amount and continued healthcare coverage for 24 months. In addition, the
Employment Agreements, as amended, provide that all outstanding equity grants will accelerate and vest upon the
earlier of the date such executive’s employment is terminated or the closing date of a Change in Control. The
51

Company will also pay each such executive a tax gross-up payment in respect of any excise taxes incurred by such
executive under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code that are triggered as a result of the consummation of a
Change in Control.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",56,59

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to “U.S. holders” and
“non-U.S. holders” (each as defined below) whose shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are converted into the
right to receive cash in the Merger. This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to
consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to our stockholders. This discussion is
based the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), existing and temporary U.S. Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These laws and authorities are subject to change
or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this summary. As a result, the Company cannot assure stockholders that the
tax considerations described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or would be sustained by a court if
challenged by the IRS. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS or any tax opinion of
counsel with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. Accordingly, the
discussion below neither binds the IRS nor precludes it from adopting a contrary position.
The summary applies only to beneficial owners who hold shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes), and does
not address the tax considerations for holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock subject to special treatment under
U.S. federal income tax law, including, without limitation, the following:
•
partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities (or treated as such for U.S. federal income tax
purposes);
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
tax-exempt organizations, mutual funds and pension funds;
•
individual retirement accounts;
•
insurance companies;
•
dealers or traders in securities or foreign currency;
•
persons who (i) acquired their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock through the exercise of options
or similar derivative securities or otherwise as compensation, or (ii) acquired their shares of Common Stock
or Preferred Stock through a tax-qualified retirement plan or other tax-deferred accounts;
•
persons whose shares of Common Stock are qualified small business stock for purposes of Section 1202 of
the Code;
•
persons whose shares of Common Stock are “Section 1244 stock” for purposes of Section 1244 of the
Code;
•
persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;
•
persons who hold their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock as part of a hedge, appreciated financial
position, straddle or conversion transaction;
•
persons who have acquired their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in a transaction subject to
gain rollover provisions of Section 1045 of the Code;
•
persons who have entered into a constructive sale of their Common Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Code;
•
a controlled foreign corporation;
•
a passive foreign investment company; or
•
a U.S. expatriate.
52TABLE OF CONTENTS
This summary does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, any estate or gift tax considerations,
the application of the alternative minimum tax or any U.S. federal non-income taxes (including, for example, the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income that may be imposed under the Code) or any other form of
taxation that may be applicable to a stockholder. Furthermore, it generally does not address the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated before, after, or at the same time as the Merger, whether or not they are in connection with
the Merger. Finally, this summary does not address the tax considerations to holders of Company Equity Awards with
respect to their Company Equity Awards. Accordingly, Company stockholders are urged to consult their own tax
advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the Merger, including the applicable federal, state, local, and
non-U.S. tax laws.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
holds Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the tax treatment of a partner of such partnership (or member of such other
entity treated as a partnership) generally will depend on the status of the partner (or member) and the activities of the
partner (or member) and the partnership (or such other entity treated as a partnership). A partner of a partnership (or
member of such other entity treated as a partnership) holding Common Stock or Preferred Stock should consult the
partner (or member)’s tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to such partner
(or member).
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual citizen or resident of the United States or someone treated as a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S.
federal income tax purposes;
•
a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust that (i) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or
more U.S. persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (ii) has a valid election in
effect under applicable Code and U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal
income tax purposes; or
•
an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.
The exchange of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are
converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares
(determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes, as described below under “-Backup
Withholding and Information Reporting”) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. The amount, character, and
timing of such gain or loss generally will be determined separately with respect to each block of stock owned by such
U.S. holder. For purposes of the foregoing, a block of stock is generally composed of those shares of a particular
class of stock of a company that were acquired at the same time and at the same price. Each U.S. holder should
consult such U.S. Holder’s tax advisors regarding the manner in which any cash received pursuant to the Merger
should be allocated among the U.S. Holder’s respective different blocks of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock.
Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the U.S. holder’s holding period for such
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock is more than 12 months at the Effective Time and otherwise should be
short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders are generally subject to a
reduced tax rate and short-term capital gains are generally subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates. There are
limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Non-U.S. Holders
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that is not a U.S. holder or a
partnership (or any other entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
In such case, a non-U.S. holder whose shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are exchanged for cash in the
Merger generally is not expected to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on such sale or
exchange unless:
•
the gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s trade or business within
the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States);
•
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of the exchange of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger and
certain other conditions are met; or
•
the non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than
5% of the Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock basis at any time
during the five-year period preceding the Merger and the Company is or has been a “United States real
property holding corporation” within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income
tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or the period that
the non-U.S. holder held Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common Stock
basis.
A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income
tax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder, subject to an applicable income tax treaty
providing otherwise. If such non-U.S. holder is a corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to
30% (or a lower treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for
certain items. A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and
such non-U.S. holder’s country of residence) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses,
if any, provided that the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
We believe we are not and have not been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income
tax purposes at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Backup withholding of tax (currently at the rate of 24%) may apply to cash payments to which a non-corporate U.S.
holder is entitled under the Merger Agreement, unless such U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number,
certifies that such number is correct and it is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9, and otherwise
complies with the backup withholding rules. Each of our U.S. holders that is a stockholder of record should complete
and sign, under penalty of perjury, the Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal and return it to the
Exchange Agent, in order to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless
an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the Exchange Agent. A non-U.S. holder that is a
stockholder of record and provides the Exchange Agent with the applicable Form W-8 providing certification of non-
U.S. status (such as a Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or another appropriate version of Form W-8) will generally establish
an exemption from backup withholding. A U.S. holder that fails to provide its correct taxpayer identification number
and the appropriate certifications, fail to establish an exemption as described above, or falsely certifies that it is not
subject to backup withholding generally will be subject to backup withholding and may be subject to penalties
imposed by the IRS.
Amounts withheld pursuant to the backup withholding rules are not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from
cash payments to a stockholder pursuant to the Merger under the backup withholding rules will generally be
allowable as a refund or a credit against such stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. If there is withholding on a payment to a U.S. holder and the withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, the affected U.S. holder should consult with such U.S. holder’s own tax advisor
regarding whether and how any refund might be obtained with respect to the amounts so withheld.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are for general information purposes only and are not
intended to constitute a complete description of all tax consequences relating to the Merger. Because individual
circumstances may differ, each stockholder should consult the stockholder’s tax advisor regarding the applicability
of the rules discussed above to the stockholder, the particular tax effects to the stockholder of the Merger in light of
such stockholder’s particular circumstances and the application of state, local and foreign tax laws, if applicable.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until, following the submission of
required filings with the relevant governmental authorities, the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the
Merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and neither Sanofi nor the Company shall have received a
standard form letter from the FTC, in the form announced and disclosed by the FTC on August 3, 2021, for which the
Parties shall not have been notified by the FTC that the underlying investigation has been closed or otherwise
resolved.
On September 20, 2021, the Company and Sanofi filed notification of the proposed Merger with the FTC and DOJ
under the HSR Act.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that

This section describes the material terms of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this
section and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety before
making any decisions regarding the Merger, including approval of the Merger Proposal, as it is the legal document
governing the Merger. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information about the Company,
Sanofi or Merger Sub. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings the
Company makes with the SEC, as described under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement.
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The rights and obligations of the
parties under the Merger Agreement are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this
summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by Sanofi, Merger Sub and the Company in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases
were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Sanofi and Merger Sub by the Company in connection with the
Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement
for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub rather than to establish
matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those
applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not
rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of
the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Sanofi or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change
after the Agreement Date. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual
limitations on the respective businesses of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub, because the parties may take
certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential Company disclosure letter to the Merger
Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Letter”) or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent
may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A,
only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual
information regarding the Company, Sanofi, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and
you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding the
Company and our business.
The Merger
Effects of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Officers and Directors
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL. The Company will be the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger, will become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi and will continue to exist following the Merger. As
a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company. In addition, the Common Stock will
subsequently be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file
periodic reports with the SEC.
At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and
restated as provided in the Merger Agreement. The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation will, from and
after the Effective Time, be the individuals who are the directors and officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time.
56TABLE OF CONTENTS
Closing and Effective Time
The closing of the Merger will take place no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to the
Closing of the Merger”) (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the
Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing of the Merger) or such other time
agreed to in writing by Sanofi and us. At the closing of the Merger, the Company will file a certificate of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The Merger will become effective upon
the filing of the certificate of merger or at such later time as is agreed by the parties to the Merger Agreement and
specified in the certificate of merger.
Treatment of Common Stock and Preferred Stock
In the Merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Shares) will be canceled and cease to exist and converted into the right to receive the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, which is an amount in cash equal to $9.50, without interest thereon. At the Effective Time of
the Merger, each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and cease to exist and automatically convert into the right to receive the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, which is an amount in cash in equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Liquidation
Preference Amount (as defined in the Company’s Certificate of Designation dated July 26, 2016) plus any dividends
(whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date (as defined in
the Certificate of Designation) through the closing date of the Merger and (ii) the amount that would be payable per
share of Preferred Stock if such share of Preferred Stock had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to
the effective time of the Merger.
Treatment of Options, Company SARs and Company EARs
As a result of the Merger, the treatment of the Company’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be as follows:
Company Options
As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without
any action on the part of any holder of Company Options, (i) all unvested Company Options which are outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become exercisable Company Options, and (ii) to the
extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time, with the
former holder of such canceled Company Option becoming entitled to receive in consideration of the cancellation of
such Company Option, the Company Option Merger Consideration, which is an amount in cash equal to: (A) the
excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option;
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Company Option. If the exercise price per
share of any Company Option is equal to or greater than the Common Stock Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be canceled and terminated without any consideration in respect thereof. Sanofi shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Option Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to
deduction for any required withholding taxes, at the Effective Time or at the Company’s next ordinary course payroll
date (but in no event later than 20 business days after the Effective Time).
Company SARs
As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without
any action on the part of any holder of Company SARs, all unvested Company SARs which are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully vest and become exercisable Company SARs, and each Company
SAR that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled at the Effective Time, with the former
holder of such canceled Company SAR becoming entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company SAR, the Company SAR Merger Consideration, which is an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any,
of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company SAR multiplied by (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company SAR. If the exercise price of any Company SAR is
equal to or greater than the Common Stock Merger Consideration, such Company SAR shall be
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
canceled and terminated without any consideration in respect thereof. Sanofi will cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay the Company SAR Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required
withholding taxes, at the Effective Time or at the Company’s next ordinary course payroll date (but in no event later
than 20 business days after the Effective Time).
Company EARs
As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without
any action on the part of any holder of Company EARs, all unvested Company EARs which are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully vest, and each Company EAR that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be canceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such Company EAR becoming
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company EAR, the Company EAR Merger
Consideration, which is an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration over the base price of such Company EAR multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company EAR. If the base price per share of any Company EAR is equal to or greater than the
Common Stock Merger Consideration, such Company EAR shall be canceled and terminated without any
consideration in respect thereof. Sanofi shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company EAR Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required withholding taxes, at the Effective
Time or at the Company’s next ordinary course payroll date (but in no event later than 20 business days after the
Effective Time).
Termination of Company ESPP
Following the Agreement Date, (i) with respect to any outstanding Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP)
under the Company ESPP as of the Agreement Date, no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the
percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election in effect on the Agreement Date for such Offering Period
and no new participants may participate in such Offering Period; (ii) no new Offering Period will commence under the
Company ESPP on or after the Agreement Date; (iii) any Offering Period under the Company ESPP that does not end
prior to the Effective Time will terminate and a Subscription Date (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) will
occur under the ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Offering Period, in which case any
shares of Company Common Stock purchased under the Offering Period will be treated the same as all other shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger; and (iv) immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company ESPP will
terminate.
Payment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Stock Certificates
Prior to the Effective Time, Sanofi will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to us (the “Exchange Agent”) to make
payments of the Merger Consideration to stockholders. At or prior to the Effective Time, Sanofi shall provide or
cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to
stockholders (less any Merger Consideration in respect of any Excluded Shares and Preferred Stock).
Promptly following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will send to each holder of record of shares of Common
Stock at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock
certificates and book-entry shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Sanofi will pay each holder of Preferred Stock the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration payable in respect of their
shares of Preferred Stock.
You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock
certificates to the Exchange Agent without a letter of transmittal.
Each holder of shares of Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall be entitled to receive, upon (1) surrender to the Exchange Agent of the certificate representing such shares of
Common Stock, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal or (2) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the
Exchange Agent (or such other evidence of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a
book-entry transfer of uncertificated shares, the Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect of the Common
Stock represented by such certificate or uncertificated shares. The amount of any Common Stock Merger
Consideration paid to the stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is not claimed within one year following the Effective Time, such cash
will be returned to Sanofi, upon demand, and any holders of Common Stock who have not complied with the
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to Sanofi for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent
that remains unclaimed immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise become property of a
Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Sanofi free and clear
of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
If any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, such stockholder will have to make an affidavit of that fact claiming such stock
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sanofi, deliver a written indemnity agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Sanofi.
Appraisal Rights
Stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. This means that you are
entitled to have the fair value of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery and to receive payment based on that valuation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly
the procedures specified under the DGCL. The ultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less
than, equal to or more than the amount you would have received under the Merger Agreement.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is
taken on the Merger Agreement and you must not vote (either in person or by proxy) in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in
the loss of your appraisal rights. See “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 79 and the text of the Delaware appraisal
rights statute reproduced in its entirety as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Common
Stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult
with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand
for appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.
THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE
WITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD
CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION
262 OF THE DGCL, THE FULL TEXT OF WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AS ANNEX B.
Representations and Warranties
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub.
Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by the Company are qualified as to
“materiality” or “Company Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material

operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a

provided, however, none of the following will be deemed in and of themselves, either alone or in combination, to

No Solicitation or Negotiation of Takeover Proposals
From the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective
Time, the Company has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers,
and to direct other representatives not to:
•
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
below) (other than discussions solely to inform any person of the provisions contained in the Merger
Agreement relating to Acquisition Proposals);
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (other than, in response to an unsolicited
inquiry from any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, informing such person of the provisions
contained in the Merger Agreement relating to Acquisition Proposals) or negotiations regarding, or
provide any non-public information or data to any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
•
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal; or
•
except as permitted by a Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined below), approve, endorse,
recommend, or execute or enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Exceptions
Notwithstanding the restriction described above, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
Company’s stockholders, the Company and its representatives may (i) provide information in response to a request
therefor by a person who makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if the Company did not violate the restrictions
set forth above in any material respect in respect of such person and following the Agreement Date if (x) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a violation of the restriction described above in any material respects,
provided that the Company will substantially concurrently provide to Sanofi any nonpublic information concerning
the Company that is provided to any such person given access which was not previously provided to Sanofi or its
representatives, (y) prior to providing such information, the Company receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate to the other party
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement previously executed by the Company and Sanofi (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or otherwise prohibit the
making, or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal and that does not prohibit the Company from providing any
information to Sanofi or otherwise prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations under the Merger
Agreement) and (z) the Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) makes available to Sanofi
any non-public information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries that the Company provides to any such
person that was not previously made available to Sanofi; (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any person who has made such an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable or propose to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, (A) prior to taking any action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii)
above, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal and
64
TABLE OF CONTENTS
financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (B) prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board of Directors has
determined in good faith based on information then available that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) in the case referred to in clause (iii)
above, the Board of Directors determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
•
“Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide written offer, proposal or similar indication of interest
contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction (other than an offer, proposal or similar
indication of interest by Sanofi, Merger Sub or one of Sanofi’s other subsidiaries).
•
“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) involving:
•
any acquisition or purchase by any third party, directly or indirectly, of more than 15% of any class of
outstanding voting or equity securities of the Company, or any tender offer (including a self-tender
offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party beneficially owning more
than 15% of any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of the Company;
•
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, equity investment, joint venture,
recapitalization, reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Company and any third party;
or
•
any, sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition to any Person of more than 15% of the
consolidated assets, revenue or net income of the Company and its subsidiaries (with assets being
measured by the fair market value thereof).
•
“Competing Acquisition Transaction” has the same meaning as “Acquisition Transaction” except that all
references therein to “15%” shall be references to “50%.”
•
“Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that if consummated would result in a
third party owning, directly or indirectly, (a) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock
or (b) more than 50% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in either case,
which the Board of Directors determines in good faith: (i) to be reasonably likely to be consummated if
accepted; and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company’s
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, in each case, taking into account at the time of
determination any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement offered by Sanofi in response to such
Acquisition Proposal.
No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement
As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the
recommendation that the holders of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, the Board of Directors may not (with any action
described in the following bullets being referred to as a “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
•
fail to make, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify), in a manner adverse to Sanofi or Merger Sub, the Board of Directors’ recommendation with respect
to the Merger;
•
approve, adopt or recommend, publicly or otherwise, an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to include the Board of Directors’ recommendation with respect to the Merger in this proxy statement;
•
fail to recommend in a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 against any Acquisition
Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (other
than any tender offer or exchange offer by Sanofi or Merger Sub) within 10 business days after the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer;
•
in the event that an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed, fail to
publicly reaffirm its recommendation with respect to the Merger Agreement within five business days after
Sanofi so requests in writing.
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, the Board of Directors may not cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or any contract (other than certain acceptable confidentiality agreements) relating
to any Acquisition Proposal.
Fiduciary Exception
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company:
•
the Board of Directors may make a Company Board Recommendation Change (1) if the Company receives a
bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposal after the Agreement Date that did not result from a violation of
the restriction against soliciting Acquisition Proposals described above and the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors) based on the
information then available that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) other than
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, in response to an event, development or change in
circumstances that materially affects the business, assets or operations of the Company (and does not
result primarily from a breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company) and that was neither known to the
Board of Directors nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, which
event, occurrence, fact or change becomes known to the Board of Directors prior to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders, and, in each case of (1) and (2), only if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
•
if the Board is permitted to make a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (1) of the
preceding bullet, the Company may also terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to the applicable Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that neither the Board of Directors nor the Company will take any such action unless:
•
the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under the foregoing two
bullets;
•
the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Sanofi at least 96 hours in advance to the effect
that the Board of Directors intends to take any such action (which notice will include in reasonable detail
the circumstances giving rise to such proposed action);
•
the Company shall have during such 96 hour period negotiated with Sanofi in good faith (to the extent that
Sanofi desires to so negotiate) to make modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
so that (A) the failure to take any such action would no longer be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law and (B) with respect to any such action to be taken in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that in the event of any material revision to the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company will
be required to deliver a new notice to Sanofi with respect to such revised Superior Proposal (except that the
notice period in respect of such revised Superior Proposal will be two business days);
•
at or following the end of such notice period described above, the Board of Directors shall have determined
in good faith based on the information then available that (A) failure to take such action would continue to
be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law and (B) with respect to any such
action to be taken in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case taking into account any revisions to the Merger Agreement
made or proposed in writing by Sanofi prior to the time of such determination; and
•
in the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms and shall have paid Sanofi the termination fee described in the section captioned
“Termination Fees and Expenses” below.
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certain Permitted Disclosure
Nothing in the Merger Agreement will be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal securities laws with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, except that the Company must
nevertheless comply with its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to resolving to make or making a
Company Board Recommendation Change.
Existing Discussions
The Company was required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to (and direct its subsidiaries to) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior
to the Agreement Date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, to immediately cease providing any further
information to any such person and to promptly terminate all access granted to any physical or electronic data room
to any such person.
Company Stockholders Meeting
The Company must use its reasonable best efforts to take, in accordance with applicable law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of the Common Stock (the
“Stockholders Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of the Merger Agreement to
consider and vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Proxy Statement
The Company must prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date, this proxy
statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment
or supplement thereto, the “Proxy Statement”) and, subject to the Company’s ability to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change as described above, will include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Each of Sanofi and the Company are required provide the other with information as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with this Proxy Statement.
Efforts to Complete the Merger; Regulatory Approvals
The Company and Sanofi agreed to cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under the Merger Agreement and applicable laws, including antitrust laws, to consummate and make effective
the Merger as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable (and in any event making
appropriate filings pursuant to the HSR Act within 10 business days of the Agreement Date) all documentation to
effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings to, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from, any third party
and/or any governmental authority in order to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of the Merger
Agreement.
The Company and Sanofi have each agreed to take or cause to be taken the following actions: (1) the provision to
each and every federal, state, local or foreign court or governmental authority of non-privileged information and
documents requested by any governmental authority or to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, as promptly as practicable and advisable, and (2) the use of its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination
or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as promptly as practicable and advisable. Such actions shall include, if
necessary, the proffer and agreement by Sanofi of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal or holding separate
of, such assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations, or interests
therein, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates if such actions should be necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any proceeding in any
forum or (y) issuance of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or law, in each case that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement by
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any government antitrust entity (it being understood that no such action will be binding on the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates unless it is contingent upon the occurrence of the closing of the Merger), provided that
none of the Company, Sanofi or any of their respective affiliates shall be required to (1) take, or agree to take any
such actions unless all actions collectively would not be material to the business, operations, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2) take any such action
with respect to Sanofi, its affiliates or their respective assets, categories of assets, businesses, relationships,
contractual rights, obligations or arrangements or (3) defend through litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in
any court, agency or other proceeding by any person, including, any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions.
Convertible Notes
The Company shall timely provide any notices, announcements, supplemental indentures, certificates or legal
opinions to be provided in connection with the Merger pursuant to the terms of the indenture relating to the
Convertible Notes on or prior to the Effective Time and shall reasonably cooperate with Sanofi in connection with
any tender offer, conversion or other repayment of the Convertible Notes pursuant to the Indenture.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will, at Sanofi’s request, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Sanofi so that the capped call transactions relating to the Company’s Convertible Notes are terminated at or as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time. The Company will not, without Sanofi’s prior consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld), (x) make amendments, modifications or other
changes to the terms of the documentation relating to such capped call transactions, (y) exercise any right it may
have to terminate, or cause the early settlement of, any of such capped call transactions or (z) enter into any
discussions, negotiations, or agreements with the counterparties to such capped call transactions with respect to any
of the foregoing.
Indemnification and Insurance
The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will honor and fulfill in all
respects the indemnification, exculpation, and advancement obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries and the
current or former directors and/or officers of the Company or any of the Company’s subsidiaries (the “Indemnified
Persons”) for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case as provided in the Company’s
or its subsidiaries’ certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other similar organizational documents and any
indemnification agreement between any Indemnified Person and the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case,
as in effect on the Agreement Date). In addition, during the six-year period commencing at the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Sanofi will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries
to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses with respect to acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Company’s or its
subsidiaries’ certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other similar organizational documents as of the Agreement
Date, as applicable, and such provisions will not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified (whether by operation
of law or otherwise) in any manner except as required by applicable law.
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, during the six-year period commencing at the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Sanofi must cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person, from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including, to the extent applicable, a duty to
advance reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising, directly or indirectly, out of or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to (1)
any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or the Company’s subsidiaries or other affiliates that occurred prior to or at the
Effective Time; and (2) any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided, however that if, at
any time during the six-year period commencing at the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Sanofi a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification or advancement as described above, then the claims asserted in
such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all and/or advance
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person promptly after statements therefor
are received. No Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written
consent.
In addition, without limiting the foregoing, the Merger Agreement requires that prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance; provided, that the Company shall not be permitted to expend, on such “tail” policy, an annual premium
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for its existing directors and officers
liability insurance; provided, further, that, if the amount necessary to procure such “tail” policy exceeds such
maximum amount, the Company shall procure as much coverage as may be obtained for such maximum amount. The
Surviving Corporation shall (and Sanofi shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full
force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder.
Employee Benefits
From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the closing of the Merger, Sanofi has agreed to the following
with respect to each employee of the Company and its subsidiaries who continues in the employ of Sanofi (each a
“Covered Employee”):
•
provide compensation (such term to include salary (or base wages, as the case may be), annual cash bonus
opportunities, commissions and severance) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the
compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation, retention, change of control,
transaction or similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred compensation) provided to such Covered
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and benefits (including the costs thereof to participants in
employee benefit plans of the Company) that are, in the aggregate no less favorable to the benefits
(excluding, any defined benefit pension plan, retiree medical benefits, equity or equity-based
compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred
compensation) provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
•
for Covered Employees who become eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of Sanofi, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries (collectively,
“Sanofi Benefit Plans”) during the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i) waive any preexisting
condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to any Covered Employee under any Sanofi Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation was waived or satisfied under the Company Plan the Covered
Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Sanofi Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each
Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employee’s
coverage under any Sanofi Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid, to the
same extent such credit was given under the Company Plan the Covered Employee participated in
immediately prior to coverage under the Sanofi Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under the employee benefit plan of Sanofi;
•
recognize the service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time for vesting and eligibility
purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical
benefits) to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
However, in no event will any provision of the Merger Agreement result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.
In the event that the Company’s 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to Sanofi’s request, Covered Employees shall be
eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Sanofi or the Surviving Corporation.
However, nothing in the Merger Agreement will (i) be construed to limit the right of Sanofi, the Company, or any of
the Company’s subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to amend or
terminate any Company employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement to the extent
such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, (ii) be construed as an amendment to
any Company employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) be construed to
69
TABLE OF CONTENTS
require Sanofi, the Company, or any of its subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to retain the employment of any particular person for any fixed period of time following the Effective
Time; or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any Covered Employee).
Other Covenants and Agreements
The Merger Agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including covenants related to:
•
the Company affording Sanofi reasonable access during normal business hours to the Company’s and its
subsidiaries’ books, records, Tax Returns, material operating and financial reports, work papers, assets,

information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries, as Sanofi or third parties providing financing may
reasonably request;

such legal proceedings, subject to certain conditions;

individual who is or may become subject to reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act;

the Company preparing all filings, making all payments and taking any similar actions that must be made,
paid or taken within 30 days following the Effective Time for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining,
perfecting, extending or renewing any Company intellectual property registrations;
•
Sanofi causing the sole stockholder of Merger Sub to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by written consent; and
•
each of Sanofi and Company promptly notifying the other party upon receiving knowledge of (1) any
notice or other communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (2) any event,
effect, occurrence, fact, circumstance, condition or change that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to failure of a condition precedent in the Merger Agreement.

The obligations of each of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction, or waiver, of the following conditions:
•
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock entitled to vote thereon;

the waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the
HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws shall have expired or have been terminated, and neither
Sanofi nor the Company shall have received a standard form letter from the FTC, in the form announced
and disclosed by the FTC on August 3, 2021, for which the Parties shall not have been notified by the FTC
that the underlying investigation has been closed or otherwise resolved (as further detailed in the section

We are asking you to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement
and the Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The
Merger” beginning on page 23 of this proxy statement and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 56 of this
proxy statement. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to
read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.
Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock)
voting in favor of the Merger Proposal. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail
to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote
against the Merger Proposal.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary and for a
minimum period of time reasonable under the circumstances, to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment
to this proxy statement is provided to Company stockholders a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Special
Meeting, or to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Proposal at the time of the
Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any
adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to provide Company stockholders with time to
review any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement, or to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting, including proxies from stockholders that have
previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Proposal. Among other things,
approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes against adoption of the Merger Proposal such that the Merger Proposal would be defeated, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Proposal and seek to convince the
holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Proposal. Additionally, we
may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of
the Special Meeting.

The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of Common Stock as of September 27,
2021 (unless otherwise noted) for:
•
each of our directors;
•
each of our named executive officers;
•
each person who is known by us to beneficially own more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock; and
•
all of our directors and executive officers as a group.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes shares as to which
a person has sole or shared voting or investment power and also includes any shares which a person has the right to
acquire within 60 days after September 27, 2021 through the vesting and/or exercise of any equity award or other
right. Except as otherwise indicated, the named persons below have sole voting and investment power with respect
to beneficially owned shares or shares such voting and investment power with his or her spouse. The number of
shares shown does not include the interest of certain persons in shares held by certain family members in their own
right. The inclusion of any such shares, however, does not constitute an admission that the named person is a direct
or indirect beneficial owner of such shares for other purposes.
The percentages of shares outstanding provided in the table are based on 176,242,263 shares of Common Stock
outstanding as of September 27, 2021. Shares issuable upon the exercise of options that are exercisable within 60
days after September 27, 2021 are considered outstanding for the purpose of calculating the percentage of
outstanding shares of Common Stock held by the individual, but not for the purpose of calculating the percentage of
outstanding shares held by any other individual.

"Kadmon Holdings, Inc._20211004_DEFM14A_19567888_4305283.Pdf",APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Under the DGCL, if you do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement, you
have the right to seek appraisal of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and to receive payment in cash
for the fair value of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as,
the Merger Consideration, that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. These
rights are known as appraisal rights. The Company’s stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must not
vote in favor of the Merger Proposal and must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”)
in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 is required. Failure to
follow precisely any of the statutory requirements will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.
This section is intended as a brief summary of certain provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures that a
stockholder must follow in order to seek and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete
statement of all applicable requirements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the
full text of which appears in Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The following
summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.
Section 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, as in
the case of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, the stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be
available not less than 20 days before the meeting to vote on the Merger. A copy of Section 262 must be included
with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are
available in connection with the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider
exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex B. Failure to
comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under
the DGCL.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, you must satisfy each of the
following conditions: You must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal, which must reasonably inform us of the
identity of the holder of record of the Company’s Common Stock or Preferred Stock and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and you must not vote or
submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal.
If you fail to comply with either of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration for your shares of the Company’s Common Stock or Preferred Stock as provided for
in the Merger Agreement, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of the Company’s
Common Stock or Preferred Stock. A holder of shares of the Company’s Common Stock or Preferred Stock wishing to
exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock on the date the written
demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of record
through the Effective Time, because appraisal rights will be lost if the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are
transferred prior to the Effective Time. Voting against or failing to vote for the Merger Proposal by itself does not
constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain
voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, and it will constitute a waiver of
the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.
Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either submit a proxy
containing instructions to vote against the Merger Proposal or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. The
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal.
All demands for appraisal should be addressed to Kadmon Holdings, Inc., 450 East 29th Street, New York, NY 10016,
and must be delivered before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and should be
executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. The demand must
reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand
appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock.
79TABLE OF CONTENTS
To be effective, a demand for appraisal by a stockholder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock must be made by, or in
the name of, the record stockholder, fully and correctly, as the stockholder’s name appears on the stockholder’s stock
certificate(s) or in the transfer agent’s records, in the case of uncertificated shares. The demand cannot be made
directly by the beneficial owner if he or she does not also hold the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of
record. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of Common Stock. If you hold your shares of the
Company’s Common Stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or the other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.
If shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity. If the shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,
the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two
or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting
as agent for the record owner. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of
Common Stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to the shares of
Common Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In
that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought.
Where no number of shares of Common Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all
shares of Common Stock held in the name of the record owner.
Within ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger has
become effective to each of the Company’s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and
who did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw
the demand and accept the cash payment specified by the Merger Agreement for that stockholder’s shares of the
Company’s Common Stock or Preferred Stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the
demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective
Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the
stockholder within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of
Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such
approval conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a
request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does
not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised
value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the
consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, either the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who
has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination
of the value of the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. Upon
the filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition will be made upon the Surviving
Corporation. The Surviving Corporation has no obligation to file such a petition, and holders should not assume that
the Surviving Corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, the failure of a stockholder to file such a petition within the
period specified could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal. In addition, within 120 days
after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote
in favor of the Merger Agreement, upon written request, will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock not voted in favor of
the Merger Agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate
number of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such written
request has been received by the Surviving Corporation. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of the
Company’s Common Stock or Preferred Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person
may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation such
statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the
petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock have not been reached. After notice to
stockholders who have demanded appraisal, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition and to determine those
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided by
Section 262. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery
will dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis) or (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock exceeds $1,000,000.
After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of the Company’s Common Stock and
Preferred Stock, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock,
determining their fair value as of the Effective Time after taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be
paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery
will direct the payment of such value together with interest, if any, upon surrender by those stockholders of the
certificates representing their shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock, forthwith. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded
quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1)
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.
You should be aware that investment banking opinions as to fairness from a financial point of view is not necessarily
an opinion as to fair value under Section 262. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration is fair, no
representation is made as to the outcome of an appraisal of fair value by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower
than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, we reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Common Stock is less than the Common
Stock Merger Consideration. In determining “fair value,” the Delaware Court is required to take into account all
relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value the court
must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the
merged corporation.
Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such
exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only
to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware
Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
81
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and imposed upon the Surviving Corporation and the stockholders
participating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery, as it deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts used in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro
rata against the value of all shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who
demanded appraisal rights will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with
respect to those shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, other than with respect to distributions payable to
stockholders as of a record date prior to the Effective Time. However, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120
days after the Effective Time, or if the stockholder otherwise fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such
holder’s right to appraisal, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and that stockholder will be
entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in cash, without interest thereon, less any applicable
withholding taxes, for his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, the Company’s stockholders who may wish to pursue
appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors.

principal executive office on or after the close of business on January 13, 2022, but on or before the close of business
on February 13, 2022, in order to be considered for inclusion in the Company’s proxy statement and proxy card for the
2022 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, unless the date of the
Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders is changed by more than 30 days from May 13, 2022, the one-year
anniversary of the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders.

"Kadmon Holdings, Inc._20211004_DEFM14A_19567888_4305283.Pdf",Annex B,"Annex B
GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
§ 262. Appraisal rights
(a)
Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of
this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing
pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the
stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words
“stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository
receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares,
or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b)
Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a
merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of
this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1)
Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately
prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
(ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be
available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of
this title.
(2)
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by
the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263
and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a.
Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or

GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
§ 262. Appraisal rights
(a)
Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of
this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing
pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the
stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words
“stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository
receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares,
or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b)
Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a
merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of
this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1)
Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately
prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
(ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be
available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of
this title.
(2)
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by
the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263
and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a.
Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;
b.
Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of
stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders;
c.
Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
d.
Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or
fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.
(3)
In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be
available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4)
[Repealed.]
(c)
Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply
as nearly as is practicable.
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
(d)
Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1)
If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be
submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the
meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting
(or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are
available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy
of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this
title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic
transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose
in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided.
Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this
subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
merger or consolidation has become effective; or
(2)
If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then
either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or
resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if
given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20
days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this
title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days
after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the
appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by
electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for
that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such
holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent
more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to
§ 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this
title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent
of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the
absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record
date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is
given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective
date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(e)
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or
any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with
the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic
transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the
notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of
shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were
not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either
case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of
such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request
for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f)
Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register
in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in
Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition
by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before
the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or
such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be
approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.
(g)
At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section
and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock
to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.
If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent
corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court
shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or
series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such
total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h)
After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value,
the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for
good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the
B-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment
in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in
cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if
any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by
any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to
trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in
Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i)
The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving
or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder,
in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by
certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree
may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or
resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.
(j)
The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems
equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k)
From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal
rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of
this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of
such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60
days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall
cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as
the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60
days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(l)
The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would
have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We understand that Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (“Kadmon”), Sanofi and Latour Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Sanofi (“Merger Sub”), intend to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to be dated as of
September 7, 2021 (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Kadmon and
Kadmon will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi (the “Merger”), and each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Kadmon (the “Kadmon Common Stock”), other than shares owned by
Sanofi and its affiliates, will be converted into the right to receive $9.50 in cash (the “Consideration”).
You have provided us with a copy of the Agreement in substantially final form.
You have asked Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“CF&CO”) to render our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be
received by holders of Kadmon Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates) is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.
In the course of performing our reviews and analyses for rendering this opinion, we have:
•
reviewed a draft of the Agreement, dated September 7, 2021;
•
reviewed Kadmon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, its Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K filed
since December 31, 2020;
•
reviewed certain operating and financial information relating to Kadmon’s business and prospects, including
projections for Kadmon for the 14 years ended December 31, 2034, all as prepared and provided to us by
Kadmon’s management;
•
met with certain members of Kadmon’s senior management to discuss Kadmon’s business, operations, historical
and projected financial results and future prospects;
•
reviewed the historical prices and trading volume of the Kadmon Common Stock;
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial data, stock market performance data and trading multiples of
companies which we deemed generally comparable to Kadmon;
•
reviewed the terms of certain relevant mergers and acquisitions involving companies which we deemed generally
comparable to Kadmon;
•
performed a discounted cash flow analysis based on the projections for Kadmon furnished to us by Kadmon’s
management; and
•
conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as we deemed appropriate.
We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial
and other information provided to or discussed with us by Kadmon or obtained by us from public sources, including,
without limitation, the projections referred to above. With respect to the projections, we have relied on
representations that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the senior management of Kadmon as to the expected future performance of Kadmon. We have not
assumed any responsibility for the independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any such

and other information provided to or discussed with us by Kadmon or obtained by us from public sources, including,

information, including, without limitation, the projections; we express no view or opinion as to such projections or
the assumptions upon which they are based; and we have further relied upon the assurances of the senior
management of Kadmon that it is unaware of any facts that would make the information or projections incomplete or
misleading. We have assumed that the executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from those reviewed
by CF&CO.
In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Kadmon, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. During the course of our
engagement, we were asked by the Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest from various third parties
regarding a transaction with Kadmon, and we have considered the results of such solicitation in rendering our
opinion. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms
of the Agreement without any limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory or
otherwise, that would be material in any respect to our analysis or our opinion. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by Kadmon and its advisors with respect to such
issues. Our opinion does not address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters.
We do not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of Kadmon Common Stock may
trade subsequent to the announcement of the Merger.
We have acted as a financial advisor to Kadmon in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary fee for
such services, a substantial portion of which is contingent on successful consummation of the Merger. A portion of
our compensation is payable upon delivery of this letter and may be credited against the fee payable upon
consummation of the Merger. In addition, Kadmon has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify
us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
CF&CO has previously been engaged (and may currently be engaged) by Kadmon to provide certain investment
banking and other services on matters unrelated to the Merger, for which we have received (or expect to receive)
customary fees. CF&CO may seek to provide Kadmon and Sanofi and their respective affiliates with certain
investment banking and other services unrelated to the Merger in the future.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, CF&CO has adopted certain policies and procedures to
establish and maintain the independence of CF&CO’s research departments and personnel. As a result, CF&CO’s
research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports
with respect to Kadmon, Sanofi, the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from the views of
CF&CO’s investment banking personnel.
In the ordinary course of business, CF&CO and its affiliates may actively trade (for their own accounts and for the
accounts of their customers) certain equity and debt securities, bank debt and/or other financial instruments issued
by Kadmon and/or Sanofi and their respective affiliates, as well as derivatives thereof, and, accordingly, may at any
time hold long or short positions in such securities, bank debt, financial instruments and derivatives.
It is understood that this letter is intended for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of Kadmon (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger. This letter and our opinion are not to be used
for any other purpose, or be reproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to at any time, in whole or in part,
without our prior written consent; provided, however, that this letter may be included in its entirety in the proxy
statement to be distributed to the holders of Kadmon Common Stock in connection with the Merger. This letter and
our opinion do not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors of Kadmon in connection with the Merger,
nor do this letter and our opinion constitute a recommendation to how any holders of Kadmon Common Stock should
vote or act with respect to the Merger or any related matter. Our opinion does not address Kadmon’s underlying
business decision to pursue the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or
financial strategies that might exist for Kadmon or the effects of any other Merger in which Kadmon might engage.
Our opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Kadmon Common Stock
(other than Sanofi and its affiliates) of the Consideration and does not address any other term, aspect or implication
of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. In addition, we do not express any
view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or
to be received by any of Kadmon’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with
the Merger relative to the Consideration or otherwise.

Ladies & Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Company Common Stock”), of Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), other
than (i) Sanofi, a French société anonyme (“Parent”) and its affiliates, (ii) any holders of Dissenting Shares (as
defined in the Agreement) and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company (collectively, “Excluded Holders”), of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be
received by such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) to be entered into by the
Company, Parent and Latour Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger Sub”). As more
fully described in the Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Transaction”) and
each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive $9.50 in
cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).
In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial
information relating to the Company, including publicly available research analysts’ financial forecasts; (ii) reviewed
certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the
Company, furnished to us by the Company, including financial forecasts provided to or discussed with us by the
management of the Company (such forecasts referred to herein as the “Financial Forecasts”); (iii) reviewed certain
information regarding the capitalization of the Company provided by the management of the Company; (iv)
conducted discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the Company concerning the
information described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this paragraph, as well as the business and prospects of the
Company generally; (v) reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines
of business that we deemed relevant; (vi) considered the results of efforts by or on behalf of the Company, including
by us at the Company’s direction, to solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a possible
acquisition of all or a portion of the Company; (vii) reviewed the financial terms of certain other transactions that we
deemed relevant; (viii) reviewed a draft, dated September 7, 2021, of the Agreement; (ix) participated in certain
discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and Parent and their advisors; and (x)
conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as we deemed
appropriate.
In connection with our review, we have, with your consent, relied on the information supplied to, discussed with or
reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion being complete and accurate in all material respects. We have not
assumed any responsibility for independent verification of (and have not independently verified) any of such
information. With your consent, we have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the
Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting
matters. With respect to the Financial Forecasts, we have assumed, at your direction, that they have been reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company as to the future performance of the Company. In addition, we have relied, with your consent, on the
assessments of the management of the Company as to the existing pharmaceutical products under development by
the Company and the validity of, and risks associated with, the existing and future products of the Company,
including the risks and timing of regulatory approvals and commercialization of such products. We have assumed,
with your consent, that there will be no developments with respect to any of the foregoing that would affect our

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
“Exchange Agent”) for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.2(a). Parent
shall provide (or shall cause to be provided) to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, cash
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of (i) the certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificates”) and (ii) the uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (but not any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting
Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the
Company Stock Appreciation Right Consideration, the Company Equity Appreciation Right Consideration or
the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration) (such cash, the “Exchange Fund”). If, for any reason (including
losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares (excluding any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the
Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company Stock
Appreciation Right Consideration, the Company Equity Appreciation Right Consideration or the Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation
promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to pay all such amounts, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof. All cash deposited
with the Exchange Agent shall only be used for the purposes provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise
agreed by the Company and Parent before the Effective Time. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent) a letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use
in such exchange.
(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of
a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrue on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.
(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay in advance to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
(d) After the Effective Time, the transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in
this Article I.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.3(a)
that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.3 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.
(f) The agreement with the Exchange Agent shall provide that the Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation;
provided, that (i) no such investment (including any losses thereon) shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent
from making the payments required by this Article I, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) all such investments shall be in (w)
short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (x) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (y)

by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such shares being referred to
collectively as the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger

Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to

converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 1.2(a) or Section 1.2(d), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing
such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be, in compliance with Section 1.3. The Company
shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Company Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of the Company
thereunder. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to,
or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall
not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or

Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (B) prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board has determined in
good faith based on information then available that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) in the case referred to in clause (iii)
above, the Company Board determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or
exchange offer or (E) in the event that an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly
disclosed, fail to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement within five (5) Business Days after

this Agreement, at any time prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, (x) the Company
Board may make a Change of Recommendation (1) if the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal following the Agreement Date that did not result from a violation of Section 5.3 and the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors)
based on the information then available that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) in
response to a Company Intervening Event, in either case of (1) or (2), only if the Company Board determines in
good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) if the Company Board is permitted to make a Change of Recommendation pursuant to
clause (x)(1), the Company may also terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to the applicable Superior Proposal; provided, however, that

(i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.3(e);
(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a “Determination Notice”) to Parent at least
ninety-six (96) hours in advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board intends to

proposed action, including, in the case such action is proposed to be taken in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, the information specified by Section 5.3(c) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that the delivery of a Determination Notice shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a Change of Recommendation);
(iii) the Company shall have, during the Notice Period negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement such that (A) the failure to take such action would no longer be

inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) with respect to any such
action to be taken in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that in the event of any material revision to the terms of
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new Determination Notice to Parent and
to comply with the requirements of Section 5.3(e)(ii) and this Section 5.3(e)(iii) with respect to such new
Determination Notice (except that the references to ninety-six (96) hours shall be deemed to be two (2)
Business Days) and the revised Superior Proposal contemplated thereby;
(iv) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith based on the information then available that (A) failure to take such action would continue to be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) with respect to any such
action to be taken in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or
proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination pursuant to clause (iii) above; and
(v) in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1 and paid the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.4.

Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under the U.S. federal
securities Laws with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the Company’s
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communication to the Company’s stockholders), or (ii) making any “stop-look-and-listen”
communication to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the Company’s stockholders); provided, however, that the Company Board shall not make or
resolve to make a Change of Recommendation except in accordance with Section 5.3(e).

all respects the indemnification, exculpation, and advancement obligations of the Company and the Company

“Indemnified Persons”) for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case as
provided in the Company Charter Documents, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company Subsidiaries and any indemnification agreement between any
Indemnified Person and the Company or any Company Subsidiary (in each case, as in effect on the Agreement
Date and, in the case of any indemnification agreement, as set forth in Section 5.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter). In addition, commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of

Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Company Subsidiaries to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses with respect to acts or omissions
prior to the Effective Time that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the Company Charter Documents and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date, as
applicable, and such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified (whether by operation of
Law or otherwise) in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or other Affiliates that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time or

favorable than the D&O Insurance; provided, that in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by
the Company with respect to the D&O Insurance, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount. The Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the

terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any
other person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c)

indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or
applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

been in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in
this Section 5.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

same extent such limitation was waived or satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered
Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) provide
each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employee’s
coverage under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid, to
the same extent such credit was given under the Company Employee Benefit Plan in which the Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan.
(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be
payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of
different events.
(e) Recovery. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that the covenants
set forth in this Section 7.4 are an integral part of this Agreement and the Merger, and that, without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 7.4 and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amount set forth in Section 7.4 or any portion thereof, the Company will pay to Parent its out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and costs) in connection with such Legal
Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate equal to the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to
be made plus 1% through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate
that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.
(f) Acknowledgement. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the damages resulting from
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain
and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.4 are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions and shall be (together with all
interest as described in Section 7.4(e)) the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this
Agreement where the Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4 and the
Company Termination Fee is actually paid to Parent.
