The following questions and answers for CPA:18 Stockholders briefly address some frequently asked questions about the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the special meeting of the stockholders of CPA:18 - Global. They may not include all
the information that is important to you. We urge you to read carefully this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes.
Q. Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
A. You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global have agreed to combine the companies via a merger.
More specifically, on February 27, 2022, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that
as of the effective time of the Merger (the ""Effective Time""), CPA:18 - Global will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as
the surviving entity and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey. From and after that time, in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the ""MGCL"") and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the ""MCCLA""), among other effects of
the consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease, the assets of CPA:18 - Global will transfer to, vest in and
devolve on Merger Sub, and Merger Sub will become liable for all of the debts and obligations of CPA:18 - Global.
The Merger Agreement governs the terms of the Merger and is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.
In order to complete the Merger, among other things, CPA:18 Stockholders must approve the Merger in accordance with the MGCL.
Q. What will holders of CPA:18 Common Stock receive in connection with the Merger? When will they receive it?
A. As of the Effective Time, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled
and, in exchange for cancellation of such share (other than shares held by W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries), the rights attaching to such share will
be converted automatically into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration consisting of (i)
0.0978 (the ""Exchange Ratio"") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share (the ""stock consideration"") of W. P. Carey common stock,
$0.001 par value per share (""W. P. Carey Common Stock""), and (ii) $3.00 in cash, which will be reduced by the amount (if any) of dividends paid by
CPA:18 - Global in excess of its regular quarterly dividends and may be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger Agreement to
defer the closing of the Merger in order to complete the sale of CPA:18 - Global's portfolio of Iberian student housing projects, pursuant to the
exercise by the third-party lessee of the portfolio of its option to purchase the properties, by the amount (if any) by which the Total Accrued Daily
Amount exceeds the Dividend Adjustment Amount (as each term is defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case, without interest (including the
cash, if any, paid in respect of fractional shares (as more thoroughly described herein), the ""cash component,"" and together with the stock
consideration, the “Per Share Merger Consideration”). The value of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received in exchange for each share
of CPA:18 Common Stock will fluctuate with the market value of W. P. Carey Common until the Merger is completed. Based on the trailing 3-day
volume weighted average price per share of W. P. Carey common stock of $76.17 on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of February 25, 2022,
the last trading day before public announcement of the Merger, the implied Per Share Merger Consideration was approximately $10.45.
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, W. P. Carey expects to issue approximately 13.8 million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock to
the CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries) in connection with the Merger. Upon such issuance, the W. P. Carey
Stockholders and the
3
Table of Contents
CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined company, respectively.
To the extent that a holder of CPA:18 Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of W. P. Carey Common Stock,
computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder will instead receive a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $10.45.
Q. What is the expected ongoing annualized dividend rate for a CPA:18 Stockholder based on an original investment of $10.00 per share of
CPA:18 Class A Common Stock and an original investment of $9.35 per share of CPA:18 Class C Common Stock?
A. CPA:18 Stockholders currently receive distributions at an annualized rate equivalent to 2.50% on an original investment of $10.00 per share of
CPA:18 Class A Common Stock and 2.67% on an original investment of $9.35 per share of CPA:18 Class C Common Stock. Following the Merger,
CPA:18 Stockholders who hold their shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be entitled to receive future dividends paid by W. P. Carey. Based on
W. P. Carey's current annualized dividend rate and the Exchange Ratio, each holder of CPA:18 Common Stock is expected to receive dividends at an
annualized rate equivalent to 4.13% on an original investment of $10.00 per share of CPA:18 Class A Common Stock and 4.42% on an original
investment of $9.35 per share of CPA:18 Class C Common Stock.
Q. Are there any conditions to completion of the Merger?
A. Yes. The Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including among others:
•approval of the Merger by the requisite vote of the CPA:18 Stockholders;
•the registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, will have become effective; no stop order will have been issued
or threatened by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") with regard to the registration statement; and all necessary state securities
or blue sky authorizations will have been received;
•no order, injunction or other legal restraint or prohibition, preventing the consummation of the Merger, will be in effect; and
•all consents, approvals, permits and authorizations required by the Merger Agreement to be obtained from any governmental entity will have been
made or obtained.
If any of these or the other conditions specified in the Merger Agreement are not satisfied or waived, the Merger may be abandoned by either W. P.
Carey or CPA:18 - Global. For details about the other conditions to completion of the Merger, see ""The Merger Agreement - Conditions to
Obligations to Complete the Merger and Other Transactions,"" beginning on page 105.
Q. What fees will CPA:18 - Global's advisors and other affiliates of W. P. Carey receive in connection with the Merger?
A. Carey Asset Management Corp. (""CAM"") and W. P. Carey & Co. B.V. (""W. P. Carey BV""), each an indirect subsidiary of W. P. Carey, and certain
of their affiliates provide investment and advisory services to CPA:18 - Global pursuant to written advisory and asset management agreements
(collectively, the ""CPA:18 Advisory Agreements""). Additionally, WPC-CPA:18 Holdings, LLC (the ""Special General Partner""), also an indirect
subsidiary of W. P. Carey, holds a special general partner interest in CPA:18 Limited Partnership, which is CPA:18 - Global's operating partnership
(""CPA:18 LP""), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of CPA:18 Limited Partnership dated as of January 1, 2015
(the ""CPA:18 LP Agreement"").
In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, certain fees and distributions are payable to W.
P. Carey and its affiliates (the ""Advisor Closing Amounts""),
4
Table of Contents
including (i) distributions of Capital Proceeds upon a Change of Control Event, and related allocations of profits and losses, under the CPA:18 LP
Agreement (as such terms are defined in the CPA:18 LP Agreement) and (ii) rights to amounts in respect of the termination of the Special General
Partner Interest, pursuant to the CPA:18 LP Agreement (the ""Special GP Amount"").
However, conditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, W. P. Carey has waived all rights to receive
any and all Advisor Closing Amounts. In addition, W. P. Carey will receive no disposition fees with respect to the consummation of the Merger.
W. P. Carey and its affiliates will continue to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements and
the CPA:18 LP Agreement prior to the closing of the Merger. At December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey had accrued and unpaid fees of approximately $1.1
million pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey earned approximately $12.5
million in asset management fees and $7.3 million in Special General Partner distributions from CPA:18 - Global.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction, W. P. Carey may be entitled to receive a
termination fee and the Advisor Closing Amounts, subject to a credit of the lesser of the termination fee paid and the Special GP Amount. See ""The
Merger Agreement"" beginning on page 97 for more details.
Q. Will W. P. Carey or any of its subsidiaries receive any consideration for the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock that they own?
A. No. Each share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any subsidiary of W. P. Carey immediately prior to the Effective Time
will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey subsidiary will receive any Per Share
Merger Consideration for any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it. As of April 27, 2022, the CPA:18 Record Date, W. P. Carey and its
affiliates beneficially owned 8,556,733 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate.
Q. Will CPA:18 - Global continue to pay distributions prior to the Effective Time of the Merger?
A. Yes. The Merger Agreement permits CPA:18 - Global to continue to pay a regular quarterly distribution and any distribution that is necessary for
CPA:18 - Global to maintain its REIT qualification and to avoid other adverse tax consequences. CPA:18 - Global currently intends to continue to
pay regular quarterly distributions to its stockholders with respect to quarters completed prior to the Merger. If CPA:18 - Global pays any
distributions above its regular quarterly distribution, the cash component of the Per Share Merger Consideration will be reduced by the amount of
such excess distributions.
Q. Will CPA:18 Stockholders who participated in CPA:18 - Global's distribution reinvestment plan immediately prior to its suspension, and
who desire to participate in the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan of W. P. Carey following completion of the Merger,
automatically be able to participate in such plan?
A. No, each CPA:18 Stockholder who desires to take part in W. P. Carey’s dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan (the “W. P. Carey DRIP”)
following the consummation of the Merger will need to enroll in the W. P. Carey DRIP. Stockholders should call W. P. Carey’s Investor Relations
Department at (212) 492-8920.
Q. When and where is the CPA:18 Special Meeting?
A. The special meeting of CPA:18 Stockholders will be held on July 26, 2022, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
Due to the public health impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which is referred to as COVID-19, and to support the health and well-being of CPA:18
Stockholders, business partners, employees and the CPA:18 - Global board of directors, the special meeting will be a completely virtual meeting,
conducted only as an

www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPA18merger and following the instructions on your proxy card. If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are
held by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee.
Q. What will be voted on at the CPA:18 Special Meeting?
A. As provided in the Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders of CPA:18 - Global, the CPA:18 Stockholders are requested to consider and vote
on two proposals: (i) to approve the Merger and (ii) to approve any adjournments of the special meeting, including, without limitation, a motion to
adjourn the CPA:18 Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve the foregoing proposals.
Q. Who can vote at the CPA:18 Special Meeting?
A. If you are a stockholder of record of CPA:18 - Global at the close of business on April 27, 2022, the record date for CPA:18 - Global's special
meeting, which we refer to as the ""CPA:18 Record Date,"" you may vote the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock that you hold on the record date on
any matter on which such shares are entitled to be voted at the special meeting.
Q. Why is my vote important?
A. If you do not submit a proxy or vote at the special meeting as provided in this proxy statement/prospectus, it may be difficult for us to obtain the
necessary quorum to hold the special meeting and to determine whether the Merger should be approved. In addition, if the CPA:18 Stockholders
do not vote or abstain, then the effect will be the same as voting against the approval of the Merger.
If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, generally, your broker or financial advisor
will not be able to cast a vote on the proposal to approve the Merger unless you provide instructions on how you would like your shares to be
voted at the CPA:18 Special Meeting. Therefore, your failure to provide voting instructions to the broker or financial advisor will have the same
effect as a vote against the Merger.
Q. What constitutes a quorum for the CPA:18 Special Meeting?
A. The outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast at least 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting
on any matter, being present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the CPA:18 Special Meeting.
Q. What vote is required?
A. The affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date entitled to cast a majority of all
the votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting on any matter is required to approve the proposal relating to the Merger. Pursuant to
CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of their affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not
vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between CPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its advisor; and (ii) for the purpose of
determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by
CPA:18 - Global's directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the Merger and will not be included in
making such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey and any of their
affiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the requisite approval.
6
Table of Contents
Abstentions and ""broker non-votes"" by CPA:18 Stockholders will have the same effect as votes against the approval of the Merger, since the
proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter.
Except as described above, each outstanding share of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on each proposal submitted
to the CPA:18 Stockholders for consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote. As of the close of business on the CPA:18 Record Date,
there were 149,688,862 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding, 8,632,956 of which were beneficially owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors, W.
P. Carey and any of their affiliates. With respect to the proposal relating to the Merger, given that the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock beneficially
owned by any of CPA:18 - Global's directors, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account for the purpose of determining
whether the requisite stockholder approval for the Merger has been obtained, the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining 141,055,906 shares
of CPA:18 Common Stock is required to approve the Merger.
Q. How does the board of directors recommend that I vote on the proposals?
A. The board of directors of CPA:18 - Global believes that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18
Stockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available
from unaffiliated third parties. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors) recommends that you
vote ""FOR"" the approval of the Merger.
Q. When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A. CPA:18 - Global currently expects to complete the Merger in the third quarter of 2022, or as soon as possible thereafter; however, there can be no
assurance as to when, or if, the Merger will be completed. W. P. Carey has the right under the Merger Agreement to defer the closing date in order
to complete the sale of CPA:18 - Global's portfolio of Iberian student housing projects. The third-party lessee of the portfolio has a right to
purchase the portfolio at pre-determined prices if CPA:18 - Global engages in certain transactions, including the Merger. The third-party lessee has
exercised its option to purchase the Iberian student housing portfolio.
CPA:18 - Global reserves the right to abandon the Merger even if the CPA:18 Stockholders vote to approve the Merger and all other conditions to
the completion of the Merger are satisfied or waived, if the board of directors determines that the Merger is no longer in the best interests of the
CPA:18 Stockholders.
Q. Are there risks associated with the Merger that I should consider in deciding how to vote?
A. Yes. There are a number of risks related to the Merger that are discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus. In evaluating the Merger, you
should read carefully the detailed description of the risks associated with the Merger described in the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" and other
information either included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q. Will holders of CPA:18 Common Stock have to pay federal income taxes as a result of the Merger?
A. CPA:18 Stockholders should not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange of W. P. Carey Common Stock
for shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the Merger, except to the extent of any cash received as consideration in the exchange, as discussed herein.
Q. Am I entitled to dissenting stockholders' rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
A. CPA:18 Stockholders are not entitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in
connection with the Merger under the CPA:18 Charter and the MGCL.

Q. How do I vote without attending the special meeting?
A. If you are a holder of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date you may authorize a proxy to vote your shares by completing,
signing and promptly returning the proxy card in the self-addressed stamped envelope provided. You may also authorize a proxy to vote your
shares by telephone or over the Internet as described in your proxy card or voting instruction form. Authorizing a proxy by telephone or over the
Internet or by mailing a proxy card will not limit your right to attend the special meeting virtually and vote via the special meeting website. Those
stockholders and stockholders of record who choose to authorize a proxy by telephone or over the Internet must do so no later than 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on July 25, 2022.
Q. Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?
A. For the health and well-being of our stockholders, employees and directors, we have determined that the CPA:18 Special Meeting will be held in
a virtual meeting format only, with no physical in-person meeting. Stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date are invited to
attend the special meeting virtually and vote at the special meeting via the special meeting website.
If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, then you are not the stockholder of record. Therefore, to vote
at the CPA:18 Special Meeting, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee.
Q. If my shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, will my broker or financial advisor
vote my shares of CPA:18 Common Stock for me?
A. If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, you should follow the directions
provided by your broker or financial advisor. It is important to note that your broker or financial advisor may not vote your shares of CPA:18
Common Stock if you do not provide instructions on how you would like your shares to be voted at the CPA:18 Special Meeting. Therefore, your
failure to provide voting instructions to the broker or financial advisor may have the same effect as a vote against the Merger.
Q. Once the Merger has been completed, do CPA:18 Stockholders have to do anything to receive their Per Share Merger Consideration?
A. No. Following the Effective Time of the Merger, W. P. Carey will cause a third-party transfer agent to record the issuance of the shares of W. P.
Carey Common Stock to the holders of CPA:18 Common Stock on the stock records of W. P. Carey. W. P. Carey will issue shares of W. P. Carey
Common Stock to holders of CPA:18 Common Stock in uncertificated book-entry form. No physical stock certificates representing the shares of W.
P. Carey Common Stock will be delivered. The cash component of the Per Share Merger consideration will be sent in the form of a check to the
investor’s address of record or alternate payment instructions established by the investor on their account for non-custodial accounts. If shares
are held in a custodial or broker-controlled account, payment will be made to the custodian or broker/dealer, as applicable.
Q. What do I need to do now?
A. You should carefully read and consider the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, including its annexes and the information
incorporated by reference into this document. It contains important information about the factors that the CPA:18 - Global considered in evaluating
whether to vote to approve the Merger. You should then complete and sign your proxy card and return it in the enclosed envelope as soon as
possible so that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, or authorize your proxy by telephone or over the Internet in accordance with
the instructions on your proxy card. If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, you
should receive a separate voting instruction form with this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q. Can I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
A. Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your shares are voted at your special meeting. To revoke your proxy, you must either (i) notify
the Corporate Secretary of CPA:18 - Global in writing, (ii) mail a new, properly executed proxy card dated after the date of the proxy you wish to
revoke, (iii) submit a later dated proxy by telephone or over the Internet by following the instructions on your proxy card or (iv) attend the special
meeting virtually and vote via the special meeting website. Merely attending the special meeting will not constitute revocation of your proxy. If
your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held through a broker, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to
change your vote.
Q. Will a proxy solicitor be used?
A. Yes. CPA:18 - Global expects to utilize some of the officers and employees of W. P. Carey's wholly-owned subsidiary, CAM, and certain of W. P.
Carey’s consultants (who, in each case, will receive no compensation in addition to their regular salaries or hourly compensation, as applicable, for
these services) to solicit proxies personally and by telephone. In addition, CPA:18 - Global has engaged Broadridge Investor Communication
Solutions, Inc. (""Broadridge"") to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the meeting. CPA:18 - Global estimates that the fees payable to Broadridge
will be approximately $200,000. CPA:18 - Global has agreed to reimburse Broadridge for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements
incurred in connection with the proxy solicitation and to indemnify Broadridge against certain losses, costs and expenses. No portion of the
amount that CPA:18 - Global is required to pay Broadridge is contingent upon the closing of the Merger.
Q. Who can help answer my questions?
A. If you have more questions about the Merger or any of the matters discussed herein, including any of the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, or would like additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus, please contact:

properties, comprised of 19 self-storage properties and one hotel.
W. P. Carey also earns fees and other income by managing the portfolios of two remaining non-traded investment programs

CPA18 Merger Sub LLC
c/o W. P. Carey Inc.
One Manhattan West
395 9th Avenue, 58th Floor
New York, New York 10001
(212) 492-1100
CPA18 Merger Sub LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey (""Merger
Sub""), was formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the Merger. Merger Sub has not carried on any activities or operations to
date, except for those activities incidental to its formation and undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. By operation of the merger, CPA:18 - Global will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub
surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey.
Reasons for the Merger
The board of directors of W. P. Carey has determined that the Merger satisfies many objectives of W. P. Carey for its growth and
future return to its stockholders. Some of the material factors considered by W. P. Carey's board of directors include:
Strategic Benefits
•the Merger is expected to be immediately accretive to the real estate segment of the combined company's Adjusted Funds From
Operations (""AFFO"") per share;
•the Merger improves W. P. Carey's earnings quality by replacing investment management fee streams with stable, higher-value
real estate rental income and increases the percentage of W. P. Carey’s dividend covered by real estate rental income;
1
1
Table of Contents
•the consummation of the Merger will substantially complete W. P. Carey's long-term strategy to exit the investment management
business, simplifying operations and future reporting disclosures;
•given that W. P. Carey and its affiliates act as CPA:18 - Global's advisor and manage the day-to-day activities of CPA:18 - Global,
the Merger would not require real estate due diligence that would otherwise occur with an unrelated third party and significantly
reduces integration risks;
•the high likelihood that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner given the commitment of both parties to complete the
Merger pursuant to their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, the absence of any significant closing conditions
under the Merger Agreement, other than the CPA:18 Stockholder Approval and third-party consents, and the fact that W. P.
Carey's obligation to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing contingency;
•the expectation that, upon completion of the Merger, existing W. P. Carey Stockholders will own approximately 93% of the
combined company;
•provisions in the Merger Agreement including the requirement of CPA:18 - Global to pay W. P. Carey a termination fee if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances;
Portfolio Benefits
•CPA:18 - Global owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is aligned with W. P. Carey's existing portfolio based on asset type,
tenant industry and geographic locations;
•the Merger will further increase W. P. Carey’s portfolio diversification and improve certain metrics including decreasing its top
ten tenant concentration;
•W. P. Carey will acquire a portfolio of operating self-storage assets that provide compelling opportunities for potential upside;
•as a result of the Merger, the remaining joint ventures between W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global on seven properties will be
collapsed;
Size and Scale Benefits
•the Merger increases W. P. Carey's size and scale resulting in a combined company equity market capitalization of approximately
$15.8 billion and a combined company total enterprise value of approximately $23.4 billion;
•the Merger will further solidify W. P. Carey as one of the largest REITs in the U.S. REIT Index (RMZ);
•the Merger will improve operational efficiency by spreading W. P. Carey's general and administrative expenses over a larger
owned real estate asset base;
Balance Sheet Benefits
•the combined company is expected to maintain W. P. Carey's strong and flexible investment-grade balance sheet;
•the Merger is not expected to meaningfully alter balance sheet metrics of W. P. Carey, due to the relative size of CPA:18 - Global
and its leverage profile;
•the Merger presents the opportunity for potential interest-cost savings and additional accretion from refinancing opportunities;
and
•the Merger is expected to improve W. P. Carey's overall cost of capital and incrementally increase stock liquidity.
12
Table of Contents
The board of directors of W. P. Carey also considered a number of potentially negative factors about pursuing the Merger,
including:
•the Merger is expected to lower overall AFFO per share due to the reduction in asset management fees and reimbursements paid
by CPA:18 - Global;
•the temporary increase in the ratio of secured debt to gross assets and certain leverage metrics as a result of the Merger;
•the possibility that the Merger may not be completed, or that completion may be unduly delayed, for reasons beyond the
control of W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global;
•the risk that failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the financial results of W. P. Carey and the price of its
common stock;
•the possibility that the value per share for W. P. Carey Stockholders could be reduced immediately following the Merger;
•the substantial costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Merger;
•certain CPA:18 - Global assets have higher risk profiles or may not be aligned with W. P. Carey's long-term investment strategy;
•the obligation of W. P. Carey to pay certain expenses if the Merger is terminated under certain conditions;
•the risk that the efforts necessary to complete the Merger could result in a disruption in the operations of W. P. Carey by, among
other things, diverting management focus and other resources of W. P. Carey from operational matters, strategic opportunities
and its day-to-day business;
•the risk that certain anticipated benefits of the transaction might not be realized on the expected timeframe or at all; and
•the other relevant factors to W. P. Carey described under the section titled ""Risk Factors.""
At a meeting on February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors)
and the CPA:18 Special Committee adopted resolutions declaring that the Merger is (A) advisable and in the best interests of
CPA:18 - Global and the stockholders of CPA:18 - Global, (B) fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and (C) on terms and
conditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties, and directing that the Merger be submitted for
consideration at a special meeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders. Jason E. Fox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P.
Carey, abstained from voting on the matters. In making their determination, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18
Special Committee considered a variety of factors, as described under ""The Merger - CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger""
beginning on page 43. Some of those factors are:
•the expectation that the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey will provide liquidity to CPA:18 - Global's stockholders by
delivering to them cash and shares in a publicly traded company with a broad stockholder base, and with no lock-ups or other
restrictions on transfer on the shares;
•the Per Share Merger Consideration implies a premium of 17% and 15% to CPA:18 - Global's most recently published net asset
value (""NAV"") per share of $9.07 at September 30, 2021, based on the closing price of W. P. Carey Common Stock of $77.66 on
February 25, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger) and the 3-day volume weighted-average price of
$76.17 for the three days ending on and including February 25, 2022, respectively;
•the dividend that the CPA:18 Stockholders will receive on the stock consideration, based on W. P. Carey's existing dividend rate
will be slightly increased;
13
Table of Contents
•the expectation that the combined company will be among the largest publicly traded REITs with an expected enterprise value of
approximately $23.4 billion and total market capitalization of approximately $15.8 billion, and a more diversified portfolio of
approximately 1,338 properties with 164 million square feet of corporate real estate leased to approximately 380 companies around
the world;
•as a result of its larger size and enhanced balance sheet, the combined company is expected to have greater operating and
financial flexibility and better access to capital markets with a lower cost of capital than CPA:18 - Global on a standalone basis;
•subject to the discussion below regarding the receipt of cash consideration, the receipt of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock
in the Merger will be tax-deferred to CPA:18 Stockholders, until such time as the shares of W. P. Carey received in the Merger are
sold;
•the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee each concluded, after consideration and review with its
legal and financial advisors, that the transaction with W. P. Carey was superior to other possible liquidity alternatives for a
number of reasons, as described under ""The Merger - CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger"" beginning on page 43;
•the Per Share Merger Consideration and the other terms of the Merger Agreement resulted from arm's length negotiations
between the CPA:18 Special Committee and W. P. Carey, with the assistance of their respective advisors;
•the ability of CPA:18 - Global under the Merger Agreement, during the ""go-shop"" period, to seek acquisition proposals from
third parties; and
•the oral opinion rendered to the CPA:18 Special Committee by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (""Morgan Stanley""), which was
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion to the CPA:18 Special Committee that, as of February 27, 2022,
and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley, as set forth in Morgan Stanley's opinion, the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from
a financial point of view to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the
Excluded Shares).
The CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee also considered a number of potentially negative
factors about the Merger, including:
•the possibility that the transaction with W. P. Carey would not be completed or may be delayed, and the possible adverse effects
on the future liquidity options for CPA:18 - Global that might result if the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey were announced
and not completed;
•the risk that a different liquidity alternative or a decision not to enter into a current liquidity transaction could ultimately have
been more beneficial to CPA:18 Stockholders than the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey;
•the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the solicitation of a competing transaction after the go-shop period and the
requirement under the Merger Agreement that CPA:18 - Global pay W. P. Carey a termination fee of either $15.7 million (1.0% of
the equity value of the Merger) or $47.0 million (3.0% of the equity value of the Merger) depending on the circumstances (which,
in each case, would be credited against the Advisor Closing Amounts (as defined in the Merger Agreement)), which may deter
third parties from making a competing offer for CPA:18 - Global prior to completion of the Merger;
•the fact that the Exchange Ratio is fixed and the total consideration received by CPA:18 - Global could be reduced if W. P. Carey's
stock price declines below the 3-day volume weighted-average price for the three days ended on and including February 25, 2022
before the closing of the Merger;
•the risk that the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the Merger may not be fully realized;
14

•the other relevant factors to CPA:18 - Global described under the section titled ""Risk Factors.""
For a discussion of the material factors considered by the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee
in reaching their conclusion and the reasons why the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee
determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, please see
""The Merger - CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger"" beginning on page 43.
The Merger Agreement
As of the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be cancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such share, the rights attaching to such share will be
converted automatically into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration
consisting of (i) 0.0978 (the ""Exchange Ratio"") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share (the ""stock
consideration"") of W. P. Carey common stock, $0.001 par value per share (""W. P. Carey Common Stock""), and (ii) $3.00 in cash,
which will be reduced by the amount (if any) of dividends paid by CPA:18 - Global in excess of its regular quarterly dividends and
may be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger Agreement to defer the closing of the Merger in order to
complete the sale of CPA:18 - Global's portfolio of Iberian student housing projects, pursuant to the exercise by the third-party
lessee of the portfolio of its option to purchase the properties, by the amount (if any) by which the Total Accrued Daily Amount
exceeds the Dividend Adjustment Amount (as each term is defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case, without interest
(including the cash, if any, paid in respect of fractional shares (as more thoroughly described herein), the ""cash component,"" and
together with the stock consideration, the “Per Share Merger Consideration”).
Each share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. In addition, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P.
Carey subsidiary will receive any Per Share Merger Consideration for any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it. No
fractional shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be issued under the Merger Agreement. To the extent that a holder of CPA:18
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of W. P. Carey Common Stock, computed on the basis
of the aggregate number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder will instead receive a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $10.45. CPA:18 Stockholders are not
entitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in connection with the
Merger or the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
The respective obligations of the parties to the Merger Agreement to effect the Merger and to consummate the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on the Closing Date are subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions on or prior to the Closing Date, including:
•the CPA:18 Stockholder Approval (for the Merger) will have been obtained;
•the registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, will have become effective in accordance with
the Securities Act; no stop order will have been issued by the SEC and remain in effect, and no proceeding will have been
commenced or threatened, suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement; and all necessary state securities or blue
sky authorizations will have been received;
•no temporary restraining order, injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition, preventing the consummation of the Merger, will be in effect; and
•all consents, approvals, permits and authorizations required by the Merger Agreement to be obtained from any governmental
entity will have been made or obtained.

CPA:18 - Global will not be deemed to have breached a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger

•by either party, if upon a vote at a duly held CPA:18 Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the CPA:18

or approved or recommended a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction, in each instance in accordance with Section 4.5 of the
Merger Agreement and CPA:18 - Global has paid the CPA:18 Termination Fee; or
•by W. P. Carey, if (i) prior to the CPA:18 Special Meeting, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors or any committee thereof has
withdrawn or modified in any manner adverse to W. P. Carey its approval or recommendation of the Merger or the Merger
Agreement in connection with, or approved or recommended, any CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction or (ii) CPA:18 - Global
has entered into any agreement with respect to any CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction.
If either party terminates the Merger Agreement in a manner described above, all obligations of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global
under the Merger Agreement will terminate without any liability or obligation of W. P. Carey, Merger Sub or CPA:18, except for
any liability of a party for a willful breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the
Merger Agreement or a failure or refusal by a party to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
when such party was obligated to do so, and for certain expenses and other obligations as provided in the Merger Agreement.
CPA:18 - Global has agreed to pay W. P. Carey's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, all outside attorneys',
accountants' and investment bankers' fees and expenses), if the Merger Agreement is terminated by W. P. Carey due to a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of CPA:18 - Global set forth in the Merger Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty of CPA:18 Global has
17
Table of Contents
become untrue, in either case such that the related closing condition is incapable of being satisfied by August 31, 2022.
W. P. Carey has agreed to pay CPA:18 - Global's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, all outside attorneys', accountants', investment
bankers' and the CPA:18 Special Committee's fees and expenses), if the Merger Agreement is terminated by CPA:18 - Global due
to a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of W. P. Carey or Merger Sub set forth in the
Merger Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of W. P. Carey or Merger Sub has become untrue, in either case such that
the related closing condition is incapable of being satisfied by August 31, 2022.
In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated either (i) by CPA:18 - Global because the CPA:18 Special Committee withdrew
its recommendation of the Merger or the Merger Agreement, or approved or recommended a CPA18 Superior Competing
Transaction, or (ii) by W. P. Carey because (A) prior to the CPA:18 Special Meeting, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors or any
committee thereof withdrew or modified in any manner adverse to W. P. Carey its approval or recommendation of the Merger or
the Merger Agreement in connection with, or approved or recommended, any CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction or (B)
CPA:18 - Global entered into any agreement with respect to any CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction (each of the events
summarized in clauses (i) and (ii), as more fully described in the Merger Agreement, an ""Applicable Termination Provision""),
then in each instance, CPA:18 - Global has agreed to pay to W. P. Carey a termination fee equal to $47.0 million, provided that if
CPA:18 - Global enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with an Exempted Person with respect to a CPA:18 Superior
Competing Transaction, the termination fee will be $15.7 million (the ""CPA:18 Termination Fee"").
In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to an Applicable Termination Provision, the CPA:18 Termination
Fee is actually paid, and the Advisor Closing Amounts become payable as a result thereof, then (I) an amount, equal to the lesser
of the CPA:18 Termination Fee actually paid and the Special GP Amount, will be credited against the Advisor Closing Amounts
payable to W. P. Carey and its affiliates and (II) no Disposition Fees will be payable to W. P. Carey and its affiliates in respect of
the consummation of any CPA:18 Competing Transaction that would otherwise result in the payment of any Disposition Fees.
Additionally, in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to an Applicable Termination Provision and a
CPA:18 Competing Transaction is consummated, then the Call Right (as defined in the CPA:18 LP Agreement) will be deemed
exercised by the CPA:18 LP and the payment of the Special GP Amount (after giving effect to the CPA:18 Termination Fee Credit)
will be deemed to satisfy in full all amounts owed and payable to W. P. Carey and its Affiliates at the closing of the CPA:18
Competing Transaction pursuant to Section 11.7 of the CPA:18 LP Agreement.
Except as set forth above, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global will each pay its respective out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. W. P.
Carey and CPA:18 - Global will each bear one-half of the costs of filing, printing and mailing the registration statement and this
proxy statement/prospectus.
The Merger Agreement contains a go-shop provision that allowed CPA:18 - Global to initiate, solicit, discuss and negotiate
alternative acquisition proposals for 30 days following the execution of the Merger Agreement, which period expired on March
30, 2022 with no proposals or offers for a CPA:18 Competing Transaction having been received. The Merger Agreement contains
""no-shop"" provisions that, subject to customary exceptions and the go-shop period, restrict CPA:18 - Global's ability after the
go-shop period to initiate, solicit, discuss, negotiate or approve proposals or offers for a CPA:18 Competing Transaction to
acquire all or a significant part of CPA:18 - Global. Further, there are a limited number of exceptions that would allow the CPA:18
Special Committee to withdraw or change its recommendation for the approval of the Merger. Although the CPA:18 Special
Committee is permitted to take these actions if it determines in good faith that a failure to take such actions would be inconsistent
with the duties of the CPA:18 Special Committee members under applicable law, doing so in specified situations could entitle W.
P. Carey to terminate the Merger Agreement and to be paid the CPA:18 Termination Fee.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors of CPA:18 - Global
AT A MEETING ON FEBRUARY 27, 2022, THE CPA:18 - GLOBAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS (WITH THE UNANIMOUS VOTE
OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS), AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF
THE CPA:18 SPECIAL COMMITTEE, ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS DECLARING THAT THE MERGER IS ADVISABLE AND IN
THE BEST INTERESTS OF CPA:18 - GLOBAL AND THE CPA:18 STOCKHOLDERS, AND THAT THE MERGER IS FAIR AND
REASONABLE TO CPA:18 - GLOBAL AND ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS AT LEAST AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE
AVAILABLE FROM UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES, AND DIRECTING THAT THE MERGER BE SUBMITTED FOR
CONSIDERATION AT THE CPA:18 SPECIAL MEETING. THE CPA:18 - GLOBAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS
THAT THE CPA:18 STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER. JASON E. FOX, A DIRECTOR OF EACH
OF CPA:18 - GLOBAL AND W. P. CAREY, ABSTAINED FROM VOTING ON THE MATTERS.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 - Global Record Date entitled
to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting on any matter is required to approve the
proposal relating to the Merger. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of
their affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a
transaction between CPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its advisor; and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage
in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's
directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the Merger and will not be included in
making such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey
and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the
requisite approval.
Each outstanding share of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on each proposal submitted to the
CPA:18 Stockholders for consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote. As of the close of business on the CPA:18
Record Date, there were 149,688,862 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding, 8,632,956 of which were beneficially owned by
CPA:18 - Global's directors and affiliates, including W. P. Carey. With respect to the proposal relating to the Merger, given that the
shares of CPA:18 Common Stock beneficially owned by any of CPA:18 - Global's directors, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates
will not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the requisite stockholder approval for the Merger has been
obtained, the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining 141,055,906 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock is required to approve
the Merger. Abstentions and ""broker non-votes"" will have the same effect as votes against approval of the Merger since such
proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by CPA:18
Stockholders on the matter.
See ""The CPA:18 - Special Meeting"" beginning on page 92.
Date, Time, Place and Purpose of CPA:18 Special Meeting
The CPA:18 Special Meeting will be held in virtual format at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPA18merger on July 26, 2022,
5:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The purposes of the CPA:18 Special Meeting are (i) to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the
Merger (the ""Merger proposal""); and (ii) to consider and vote upon any adjournments of the CPA:18 Special Meeting, including,
without limitation, a motion to adjourn the special meeting to another time for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to
approve the Merger proposal (the ""Adjournment proposal"").

CPA:18 Stockholders Entitled to Vote
CPA:18 - Global's board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 27, 2022 as the record date for the CPA:18 Special
Meeting. Accordingly, only holders of record of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date are entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the CPA:18 Special Meeting. As of the CPA:18 Record Date, there were 149,688,862 outstanding shares
of CPA:18 Common Stock held by approximately 26,930 holders of record. At the CPA:18 Special Meeting, each outstanding
share of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on each proposal submitted to the CPA:18 Stockholders
for consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote (except that, as described below under ""The CPA:18 Special
Meeting - Vote Required,"" the CPA:18 - Global directors, W. P. Carey and their affiliates are not entitled to vote on the Merger).
See ""The CPA:18 - Special Meeting"" beginning on page 92.
Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee of CPA:18 - Global
The CPA:18 Special Committee retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in
connection with the Merger. The CPA:18 Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on
Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation, and its knowledge of the business and affairs of CPA:18 - Global. As
part of this engagement, the CPA:18 Special Committee requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial
point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement to the holders of shares of CPA:18
Common Stock, other than shares held by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary (referred to as the ""Excluded Shares""). On
February 27, 2022, at a meeting of the CPA:18 Special Committee, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion to the CPA:18 Special Committee dated February 27, 2022,
that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from
a financial point of view to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the
Excluded Shares).
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley dated February 27, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex B, and is hereby incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety. The opinion sets
forth, among other things, the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion.
See ""Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee of CPA:18 - Global"" beginning on page 47.
Board of Directors and Management of W. P. Carey
The directors and officers of W. P. Carey immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will continue to be the directors and
officers of W. P. Carey after the Merger. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the directors of W. P. Carey as a
group received cash and equity compensation of $2.5 million.
Regulatory Approvals
Neither W. P. Carey nor CPA:18 - Global is aware of any U.S. federal or state regulatory approvals that must be obtained in
connection with the Merger, other than compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, filing articles of merger as
required under Maryland law, and obtaining various state governmental authorizations.
Comparison of Rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and W. P. Carey Stockholders
Both CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey are incorporated in Maryland. Upon the effective time of the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders
will become stockholders of W. P. Carey. The rights of CPA:18 Stockholders are governed currently by the MGCL, the CPA:18
Charter and the CPA:18 Bylaws. Once CPA:18 Stockholders become stockholders of W. P. Carey, their rights will continue to be
governed by the MGCL but will be governed by the W. P. Carey Charter and the W. P. Carey Bylaws.

Table of Contents
For the material differences between the rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and the rights of W. P. Carey Stockholders, see
""Description of W. P. Carey Shares"" and ""Comparison of Rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and W. P. Carey Stockholders.""
Material Federal Income Tax Consequences
As a condition to and prior to the consummation of the Merger, (i) CPA:18 - Global will have received an opinion of DLA Piper
LLP (US) to the effect that, at all times since its taxable year ended December 31, 2018, W. P. Carey has been and will continue to
be organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, (ii)
CPA:18 - Global will have received an opinion from Clifford Chance US LLP to the effect that for federal income tax purposes the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, (iii) W. P. Carey and Merger Sub will have received an
opinion from DLA Piper LLP (US) to the effect that for federal income tax purposes the Merger will qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and (iv) W. P. Carey and Merger Sub will have received an opinion of Clifford Chance US
LLP to the effect that, at all times since its taxable year ended December 31, 2018, through the closing date of the Merger, CPA:18
- Global has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the
Code.
Clifford Chance US LLP, counsel to CPA:18 - Global, and DLA Piper LLP (US), counsel to W. P. Carey, are of the opinion that the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code. In accordance with this treatment, no
gain or loss will be recognized by W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global or their stockholders as a result of the Merger except to the extent
of cash received.
The federal income tax treatment of the Merger to holders of CPA:18 Common Stock depends in some instances on
determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or
authority may be available. In addition, the tax consequences of the Merger to any particular stockholder will depend on your
particular tax circumstances. We urge you to consult your tax advisor, particularly if you are a non-U.S. holder, regarding the
specific tax consequences, including the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences, to you in light of your particular
investment or tax circumstances of the Merger.
The opinions of CPA:18 - Global's tax counsel and W. P. Carey's tax counsel are based upon the law as it will exist as of the date
of the opinion, but the law may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect. Given the highly complex nature of the rules
governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances,
no assurance can be given by DLA Piper LLP (US) or us that W. P. Carey will qualify as a REIT for any particular year. The
opinions of Clifford Chance US LLP and DLA Piper LLP (US) will be expressed as of the date issued. Clifford Chance US LLP and
DLA Piper LLP (US) will have no obligation to advise CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey or their stockholders of any subsequent
change in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. Also, the opinions of
tax counsel are not binding on either the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS"") or a court, and either could take a position
different from that expressed by tax counsel.
See ""Material Federal Income Tax Considerations"" beginning on page 147.
Potential Conflicts of Interest
In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global to approve the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders
should be aware that potential conflicts of interest exist because W. P. Carey and its affiliates serve as the advisor for CPA:18 -
Global, the companies share common management, and the officers and directors of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may have
certain interests in the proposed transactions that are different from or in addition to the interests of CPA:18 Stockholders
generally. The board of directors of CPA:18 - Global (including the CPA:18 Special Committee) knew about and considered these
potential conflicts and additional interests when they approved the Merger. Certain of these potential conflicts and interests are
set forth below.
Conditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, W. P. Carey has waived all rights to
receive any and all Advisor Closing Amounts. In addition, W. P. Carey will receive no disposition fees in respect of the
consummation of the Merger.
21
Table of Contents
W. P. Carey and its affiliates will continue to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory
Agreements and the CPA:18 LP Agreement prior to the closing of the Merger. At December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey had accrued and
unpaid fees of approximately $1.1 million pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements. During the twelve months ended
December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey earned approximately $12.5 million in asset management fees and $7.3 million in Special General
Partner distributions from CPA:18 - Global.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction, W. P. Carey may be entitled
to receive a termination fee and the Advisor Closing Amounts, subject to a credit of the lesser of the termination fee paid and the
Special GP Amount.
See ""Potential Conflicts Of Interest"" beginning on page 56, ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions"" beginning on page
120 and the section titled ""The Merger Agreement"" beginning on page 97.
Shares Owned by Directors, the Advisor and Their Affiliates
As of the close of business on the CPA:18 Record Date, there were 149,688,862 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding,
8,632,956 of which were beneficially owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors and affiliates, including W. P. Carey. With respect to the
proposal relating to the Merger, given that the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock beneficially owned by any of CPA:18 - Global's
directors, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the
requisite stockholder approval for the Merger has been obtained, the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining 141,055,906
shares of CPA:18 Common Stock is required to approve the Merger.
Dissenters' Appraisal Rights or Rights of Objecting Stockholders
Under the CPA:18 Charter and Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the MGCL, CPA:18 Stockholders are not entitled to dissenting stockholders'
appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in connection with the Merger or the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby.

In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the
following risk factors in determining whether or not to vote for the Merger. You should not consider the list below to be exclusive. New risk
factors emerge periodically and stockholders cannot be completely assured that the factors described below list all material risks at any specific
period in time. This section includes or refers to certain forward-looking statements. See the section entitled ""Cautionary Statement Concerning
Forward-Looking Statements"" for the qualifications and limitations of these forward-looking statements. In addition, you should read and
consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global because these risks also affect the combined
company. Risks in relation to W. P. Carey can be found in Item 1A. Risk Factors in W. P. Carey's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in W. P. Carey’s subsequently
filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K (excluding any information and exhibits furnished under Item 2.02 or
7.01 thereof), each of which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. Risks in relation to CPA:18 - Global can be found
in Item 1A. Risk Factors in CPA:18 - Global's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on
February 25, 2022, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in CPA:18 - Global’s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or
Current Reports on Form 8-K. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the other
documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See ""Where You Can Find More Information"" beginning on page 171.
W. P. Carey Stockholders will not vote on the Merger.
Risks Related to the Stock Issuance and Merger
Changes in the market price of W. P. Carey Common Stock will affect the nominal value of the Per Share Merger Consideration.
While the Exchange Ratio is fixed at 0.0978 of a share of W. P. Carey Common Stock for each share of CPA:18 Common Stock, the nominal value of
the stock consideration component of the Per Share Merger Consideration is based on the market price of W. P. Carey Common Stock, which will
fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the following factors:
•market reaction to the Merger and the prospects of the combined company or any of the other matters described herein;
•changes in market assessments of the business, operations, financial position and prospects of either company;
•market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed;
•interest rates, general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock;
•federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses in which W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global
operate;
•general market trading activities; and
•other factors beyond the control of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global, including those described or referred to elsewhere in this ""Risk Factors""
section.
In addition, sales of W. P. Carey Common Stock received in the Merger generally may be sold in the public markets immediately following the
Merger since CPA:18 Stockholders may sell their shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock shortly after the Merger for any number of reasons. The sale
of significant amounts of W. P. Carey Common Stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may lower the market price of W. P. Carey
Common Stock.
25
Table of Contents
The market price of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock at the Effective Time may vary from its price on the date the Merger Agreement was
executed, on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and on the date of the CPA:18 Special Meeting. As a result, the market value of the Per
Share Merger Consideration will also vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock during the
period from February 25, 2022, the last trading day before the announcement of the Merger, through April 21, 2022, the market value of the stock
consideration comprising part of the Per Share Merger Consideration implies a Per Share Merger Consideration value ranging from a low of $10.57
to a high of $11.38, representing a 17% to 26% premium to CPA:18 - Global's most recently published estimated net asset value (""NAV"") per share of
$9.07 for both CPA:18 Class A Common Stock and CPA:18 Class C Common Stock as of September 30, 2021.
The CPA:18 Stockholders may have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the Merger than they
currently exercise over the management and policies of CPA:18 - Global prior to the Merger.
Currently the W. P. Carey Stockholders and the CPA:18 Stockholders own all of the outstanding shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock and CPA:18
Common Stock, respectively, and thus control all of the voting securities of their respective company. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the
separate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease, and each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such shares (other than shares held by W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries), be converted
automatically into the right to receive shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock and cash. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, W. P. Carey
expects to issue approximately 13.8 million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock to the CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its
subsidiaries) in connection with the Merger. Upon such issuance, the W. P. Carey Stockholders and the CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey
and its subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined company, respectively. Consequently, the CPA:18 Stockholders, as a
general matter, may have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the consummation of the Merger than
they currently exercise over the management and policies of CPA:18 - Global immediately prior to the Merger.
The pendency of the Merger could adversely affect the business and operations of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global.
While we are undertaking the transaction described in the Merger Agreement, tenants of each of W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global may delay or defer
certain business decisions, such as whether or not to renew a lease, which could negatively impact the revenues, earnings, cash flows and
expenses of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global, regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed. In addition, due to operating covenants in the
Merger Agreement, each of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may be restricted in its ability to pursue certain strategic transactions, undertake
certain significant capital or financing transactions and otherwise pursue actions outside of the ordinary course of business, even if such actions
would prove beneficial.
Failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global.
It is possible that the Merger may not be completed. The parties' respective obligations to complete the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of specified conditions, some of which are beyond the control of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global. If the Merger is not completed, W. P.
Carey and CPA:18 - Global may be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:
•CPA:18 Stockholders would not have had the opportunity to achieve the liquidity event provided by the Merger and the board of directors of
CPA:18 - Global would have to review other alternatives for liquidity, which may not occur in the near future or on terms as favorable as the Merger;
•W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global will have incurred substantial costs and expenses related to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial
advisor fees, which will be payable by W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global even if the Merger is not completed, and are only subject to reimbursement
under certain limited circumstances;

•CPA:18 - Global may be required to pay a termination fee to W. P. Carey in the amount of either $47.0 million or $15.7 million if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances; and
•W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may be required to pay the other party's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.
The Merger Agreement restricts CPA:18 - Global's ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains a go-shop provision that allowed CPA:18 - Global to solicit, initiate and pursue alternative acquisition proposals
for 30 days following the execution of the Merger Agreement, which period expired on March 30, 2022 with no proposals or offers for a CPA:18
Competing Transaction having been received. The Merger Agreement also contains no-shop provisions that, subject to customary exceptions and
the go-shop period, restrict CPA:18 - Global's ability to initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate, discuss, negotiate or accept a competing third-party
proposal to acquire all or a significant part of CPA:18 - Global. Further, there are a limited number of exceptions that would allow the CPA:18 Special
Committee to withdraw or change its recommendation relating to the approval of the Merger. Although the CPA:18 Special Committee is permitted
to take these actions if it determines in good faith that a failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the CPA:18 Special
Committee under applicable law, doing so in specified situations could entitle W. P. Carey to terminate the Merger Agreement and to be paid a
termination fee in the amount of either $47.0 million or $15.7 million (depending upon the circumstances surrounding the termination).
Although the go-shop provision was intended to provide CPA:18 - Global the ability to conduct a reasonable ""market check"" on the adequacy of
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to CPA:18 Stockholders in connection with the Merger Agreement, it is possible that the go-shop
provision or the other provisions of the Merger Agreement could discourage a potential acquiror that might have had an interest in acquiring all or
a significant part of CPA:18 - Global from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per
share cash or market value than the consideration W. P. Carey proposes to pay in the Merger or might result in a potential competing acquiror
proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire CPA:18 - Global than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the Advisor Closing
Amounts (as defined in the Merger Agreement) payable to W. P. Carey and its affiliates and the CPA:18 Termination Fee that may become payable
to W. P. Carey in certain circumstances, subject to the credit described herein.
Closing the Merger is subject to a number of conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, could adversely impact W. P. Carey's and CPA:18 -
Global's ability to complete the Merger.
The Merger, which currently is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022, is subject to certain closing conditions, including among others: (a)
the effectiveness of the registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, pursuant to which shares of W. P. Carey
Common Stock will be issued; (b) the accuracy of W. P. Carey's, Merger Sub's and CPA:18 - Global's (as applicable) representations and warranties
and performance of covenants and obligations, as more fully described in the Merger Agreement; (c) delivery of REIT qualification and other
opinions; (d) the nonoccurrence of changes, events or circumstances which constitute a CPA:18 Material Adverse Effect or a W. P. Carey Material
Adverse Effect (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) (as applicable); and (e) receipt of the CPA:18 Stockholder Approval (for the
Merger). There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if permitted, or that the occurrence of any effect, event,
development or change will not transpire. Therefore, there can be no assurance with respect to the timing of the closing of the Merger or whether
the Merger will be completed at all.
If the Merger does not occur, CPA:18 - Global may incur payment obligations to W. P. Carey.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under the circumstances described in the section titled ""The Merger Agreement-Termination Expenses""
beginning on page 108, CPA:18 - Global may be obligated to pay W. P. Carey a termination fee in the amount of either $47.0 million or $15.7 million
(depending upon the circumstances surrounding the termination).

Risk Factors Relating to W. P. Carey Following the Merger
W. P. Carey's total level of debt will increase upon completion of the Merger.
In connection with the Merger, W. P. Carey will assume approximately $1.1 billion of CPA:18 - Global indebtedness, as a result of which, W. P. Carey
may be subject to increased risk that the combined company's cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on its debt. As of
December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey's total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $6.8 billion, with a ratio of consolidated debt to gross assets
(consolidated total assets before accumulated depreciation on buildings and improvements) of approximately 40.1%. Taking into account W. P.
Carey's existing indebtedness and the assumption of indebtedness after giving effect to the Merger, the indebtedness of the combined company as
of December 31, 2021 (excluding net lease student housing properties under purchase option, three additional net lease assets, and one operating
student housing property in CPA:18 - Global’s portfolio scheduled for disposition) would be approximately $7.74 billion, with a ratio of consolidated
debt to gross assets of approximately 42%.
The future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations
following the Merger.
Following the Merger, the combined company may continue to expand its operations through additional acquisitions and other strategic
transactions, some of which may involve complex challenges. The future success of the combined company will depend, in part, upon its ability to
manage its expansion opportunities, integrate new operations into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor its
operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and maintain other necessary internal controls. There can be no assurance that the
combined company's expansion or acquisition opportunities will be successful, or that the combined company will realize its expected operating
efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits.
The stock price of W. P. Carey Common Stock following the Merger could be lower.
W. P. Carey's current or historical share price may not be indicative of how the market will value shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock following the
Merger . The price of W. P. Carey Common Stock after the Merger could be lower than the current or historical price. One of the factors that may
influence the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock after the Merger will be the yield from distributions on W. P. Carey Common Stock compared to
yields on other financial instruments. If, for example, an increase in market interest rates results in higher yields on other financial instruments, the
market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common stock
differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we currently expect to do so after the consummation of the
differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we currently expect to do so after the consummation of the
Merger. The market price of W. P. Carey Common Stock will also be affected by general market conditions and will be potentially affected by the
economic and market perception of REIT securities.
Holders of CPA:18 Common Stock may be adversely affected if the Merger fails to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction.
Subject to the discussion below regarding the receipt of cash consideration, it is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-deferred reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code. There is no guarantee, however, that the IRS will agree with this treatment. You are advised to review the
""Material Federal Income Tax Considerations"" section beginning on page 147 for additional details.
After the Merger is completed, CPA:18 Stockholders will have different rights that may be less favorable than their current rights as CPA:18
Stockholders.
After the consummation of the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders will have different rights than they currently have as CPA:18 Stockholders. For a
detailed discussion of the significant differences between your rights as a stockholder of CPA:18 - Global and your rights as a stockholder of W. P.
Carey, see ""Comparison of Rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and W. P. Carey Stockholders"" beginning on page 136.

Table of Contents
W. P. Carey cannot assure you that it will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate.
W. P. Carey expects to continue its current dividend practices following the Merger. However, W. P. Carey Stockholders may not receive the same
dividends following the Merger for various reasons, including the following:
•as a result of the Merger and the issuance of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock in connection with the Merger, the total amount of cash required
for W. P. Carey to pay dividends at its current rate will increase;
•W. P. Carey may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in W. P. Carey's cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash
flow or financial position;
•decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the W. P.
Carey board of directors, which reserves the right to change W. P. Carey's dividend practices at any time and for any reason; and
•the amount of dividends that W. P. Carey subsidiaries may distribute to W. P. Carey may be subject to restrictions imposed by the terms of any
current or future indebtedness that such subsidiaries may incur.
The combined company will not be required to meet any diversification standards; therefore, our investments may become subject to
concentration of risk.
Subject to the intention to maintain its qualification as a REIT, there are no limitations on the number or value of particular types of investments that
the combined company may make. The combined company will not be required to meet any diversification standards, including geographic
diversification standards. Therefore, its investments may become concentrated in type or geographic location, which could subject it to significant
concentration of risk with potentially adverse effects on its investment objectives.
Because W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global have invested in properties located outside the U.S., the combined company will be exposed to
additional risks of doing business outside of the U.S. than either on a standalone basis.
Each of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global has invested in, and following the consummation of the Merger the combined company may continue to
invest in, properties located outside the U.S. At December 31, 2021, directly owned real estate properties located outside of the U.S. on a combined
company basis would have represented 37% of the combined company's current annualized contractual minimum base rent, as compared to 37% for
W. P. Carey's portfolio on a stand-alone basis, and 44% for CPA:18 - Global's portfolio on a stand-alone basis. These investments may be affected
by factors particular to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. These investments may expose the combined company to risks
that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the U.S., including:
•changing governmental rules and policies;
•local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our used standards and practices;
•enactment of laws relating to the foreign ownership of property and laws relating to the ability of foreign entities to remove invested capital or
profits earned from activities within the country to the U.S.;
•expropriation of investments;
•legal systems under which the combined company's ability to enforce contractual rights and remedies may be more limited than would be the case
under U.S. law;
•difficulty in conforming obligations in other countries and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, which may be more
stringent than U.S. laws, including tax requirements and land use, zoning, and environmental laws, as well as changes in such laws;
•adverse market conditions caused by changes in national or local economic or political conditions;
29
Table of Contents
•acts of violence, pandemics, active shooters, terrorism, political or military instability, insurrection or war;
•tax requirements vary by country and the combined company may be subject to additional taxes as a result of its international investments;
•changes in relative interest rates;
•the cost of and access to various forms of capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations;
•changes in real estate and other tax rates and other operating expenses in particular countries;
•changes in land use and zoning laws;
•restrictions and/or significant costs in repatriating cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts; and
•the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including instability in, or further withdrawals from, the
European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements.
In addition, the lack of publicly available information in certain jurisdictions in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
(""GAAP"") could impair the combined company's ability to analyze transactions and may cause the combined company to forego an investment
opportunity. It may also impair the combined company's ability to receive timely and accurate financial information from tenants necessary to meet
its reporting obligations to financial institutions or governmental or regulatory agencies. Certain of these risks may be greater in emerging markets
and less developed countries. W. P. Carey's expertise to date is primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and it has less experience in other international
markets. The combined company may not be as familiar with the potential risks to its investments outside the U.S. and Europe and it could incur
losses as a result.
Also, the combined company may engage third-party asset managers in international jurisdictions to monitor compliance with legal requirements
and lending agreements with respect to properties it owns. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may expose the combined company or its
operating subsidiaries to additional liabilities.
Moreover, the combined company will be subject to changes in foreign exchange rates due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between
foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of a foreign currency of one or more countries where the combined
company has a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on the business, investment returns and, specifically, the combined
company's U.S. dollar reported financial position and results of operations and debt covenant ratios. Although the combined company will attempt
to mitigate a portion of the risk from currency fluctuations by entering into derivative hedging agreements and financing its properties with debt in
local currency denominations, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful.
If the combined company recognizes impairment charges on its properties or investments following the consummation of the Merger, its net
income may be reduced.
Until the consummation of the Merger, both companies may incur substantial impairment charges, which each of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global
are required to recognize whenever they sell a property for less than its carrying value or they determine that the carrying amount of the property is
not recoverable and exceeds its fair value; for direct financing leases, whenever the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying property has
declined or, for equity investments, the estimated fair value of the investment's underlying net assets in comparison with the carrying value of their
interest in the investment has declined on an other-than-temporary basis. By their nature, the timing or extent of impairment charges are not
predictable. The combined company may incur non-cash impairment charges in the future, which may reduce its net income.
30
Table of Contents
Goodwill resulting from the consummation of the Merger may adversely affect the combined company's results of operations.
Potential impairment of goodwill resulting from the Merger could adversely affect the combined company's financial condition and results of
operations. The combined company will assess its goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment annually and more
frequently when required by GAAP. The combined company will be required to record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset
carrying values exceed their fair values the combined company's assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets could
indicate that an impairment of the carrying value of such assets may have occurred that could result in a material, non-cash write-down of such
assets, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and future earnings.
W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global currently face, and after the consummation of the Merger the combined company will face, other risks.
The risks listed above are not exhaustive, and you should be aware that, following the Merger, the combined company will face various other risks,
including those discussed in reports filed by W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global with the SEC. See ""Where You Can Find More Information"" beginning
on page 171.
Risk Related to CPA:18 - Global
If CPA:18 - Global's request for an extension of time under Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-3 to timely make certain entity
classification elections with respect to seven of CPA:18 - Global's subsidiaries is not granted, CPA:18 - Global would either fail to qualify as a
REIT or, assuming certain relief provisions applied, would be required to pay a significant penalty tax. In addition, the closing of the Merger
could be delayed.
By default, certain non-U.S. entities are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but can elect to be treated as partnerships or
entities disregarded from their owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which we refer to as flow-through entities. CPA:18 - Global intended to
elect to treat seven non-U.S. subsidiaries that hold certain properties located outside the United States as flow-through entities for U.S. federal
income tax purposes at the time that the entities were acquired but inadvertently failed to make such elections. CPA:18 - Global has requested an
extension of time from the IRS, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-3, to timely elect to treat these entities as flow-through entities
effective shortly after the acquisition of the entities by CPA:18 - Global. CPA:18 - Global believes that it meets the requirements to be granted such
extensions and that therefore CPA:18 - Global will be able to treat these subsidiaries as flow-through entities in prior years. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the IRS may disagree with CPA:18 - Global's position and decide not to grant the extension. As a result, no assurance can be given that
CPA:18 - Global will in fact be able to make such elections. In addition, there can be no assurance as to when the IRS may decide to grant the
extension, and while W. P. Carey has agreed with CPA:18 - Global that the decision of the IRS (and the timing of that decision) will not be a basis for
termination of the Merger Agreement, the closing of the Merger may be delayed until the extension is received.
If the IRS does not grant the extension of time to file these elections, then these subsidiaries would be treated as non-U.S. corporations during
certain prior periods. Because interests in non-U.S. corporations are not qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests, CPA:18 - Global's
ownership of such subsidiaries would cause CPA:18 - Global to fail to satisfy certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs during such prior
periods. In that event, CPA:18 - Global would either fail to qualify as a REIT beginning with such prior periods, in which case CPA:18 - Global would
be liable for substantial corporate income taxes for such prior periods, or if CPA:18 - Global were able to establish that it acted with reasonable
cause and not willful neglect, CPA:18 - Global could maintain its REIT qualification but would be required to pay a penalty tax with respect to such
failures, which could be material in amount. Prior to the Merger, any such taxes would be liabilities of CPA:18 - Global. Moreover, to the extent that
CPA:18 - Global is liable for such penalty taxes, or if CPA:18 - Global fails to qualify as a REIT, following the Merger, the liability for any such
penalty taxes or any corporate income taxes owed by CPA:18 - Global as a result of its failure to qualify as a REIT would generally become liabilities
of W. P. Carey.

Merger Consideration
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, CPA:18 - Global will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger
Sub surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey, and the separate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease. As of the
Effective Time, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and, in
exchange for cancellation of such share, the rights attaching to such share will be converted automatically into the right to receive, in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration consisting of (i) 0.0978 (the ""Exchange Ratio"") of a validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share (the ""stock consideration"") of W. P. Carey common stock, $0.001 par value per share (""W. P. Carey Common Stock""), and (ii)
$3.00 in cash, which will be reduced by the amount (if any) of dividends paid by CPA:18 - Global in excess of its regular quarterly dividends and
may be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger Agreement to defer the closing of the Merger in order to complete the sale of
CPA:18 - Global's portfolio of Iberian student housing projects, pursuant to the exercise by the third-party lessee of the portfolio of its option to
purchase the properties, by the amount (if any) by which the Total Accrued Daily Amount exceeds the Dividend Adjustment Amount (as each term
is defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case, without interest (including the cash, if any, paid in respect of fractional shares (as more
thoroughly described herein), the ""cash component,"" and together with the stock consideration, the “Per Share Merger Consideration”). Each
share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically
be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. We anticipate that the shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock issued in the Merger will trade on the
NYSE under the symbol ""WPC."" In addition, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey subsidiary will receive any Per Share Merger Consideration for
any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it immediately prior to the Effective Time.
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, W. P. Carey expects to issue approximately 13.8 million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock to
the CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries) in connection with the Merger. Upon such issuance, the W. P. Carey
Stockholders and the CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined

CORPORATE PROPERTY ASSOCIATES 18 GLOBAL INC_20220427_DEFM14A_20041574_4449712.Pdf,BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER,"Background of the Merger
W. P. Carey Inc. is an internally-managed diversified real estate investment trust and a leading owner of commercial real estate, net-leased to
companies located primarily in the United States and Northern and Western Europe on a long-term basis. W. P. Carey's management and board of
directors regularly evaluate and consider a variety of opportunities as part of W. P. Carey’s long-term strategy to maximize stockholder value. In
particular, W. P. Carey's board of directors considers opportunities that will, among other things, (i) enhance W. P. Carey's overall credit quality, (ii)
further diversify and improve the quality of its existing portfolio, (iii) allow W. P. Carey to better support its recurring dividend and (iv) further
simplify its business.
The W. P. Carey board of directors and W. P. Carey’s senior management regularly review and assess W. P. Carey’s business, operations and
financial performance, industry conditions and related developments as they may impact W. P. Carey’s long-term strategic plans and objectives. As
part of this ongoing evaluation, the W. P. Carey board of directors, together with W. P. Carey’s senior management, has from time to time considered
various potential financial and strategic opportunities to enhance stockholder value, including the evaluation of merger and acquisition
transactions of various types and the potential benefits and risks of any such transactions. In addition, W. P. Carey’s senior management, from time
to time, has engaged in discussions with representatives of
33Table of Contents
other companies regarding such opportunities and updated the W. P. Carey board of directors regarding the content of such discussions.
CPA:18 - Global is a publicly registered non-traded REIT formed in 2012. CPA:18 - Global invests in a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate
properties both in and outside the United States that includes net lease, student housing and self-storage properties with an aggregate book value
of approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, CPA:18 - Global's portfolio consisted of interests in 53 net lease
properties, 65 self-storage properties, three student housing development projects, and one student housing operating property.
CPA:18 - Global was formed to hold its investments for a number of years. As stated in CPA:18 - Global's initial public offering documents, CPA:18 -
Global's intention was to begin considering liquidity events for its stockholders generally commencing seven to twelve years following the closing
of its initial public offering, which occurred in 2015.
In June 2021, members of W. P. Carey’s senior management approached members of the CPA:18 - Global board of directors to informally discuss
timing considerations of potential liquidity events for CPA:18 - Global and CPA:18 - Global’s openness to engaging in a potential transaction with
W. P. Carey. Two in-person meetings were held on June 30, 2021, the first between Jason E. Fox, W. P. Carey’s chief executive officer, and Richard
Pinola, one of CPA:18 - Global’s independent directors, and the second, between John Park, W. P. Carey’s president, and Elizabeth P. Munson, the
chairman of the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global, in Connecticut and New York, respectively. Neither Mr. Fox nor Mr. Park made any specific
proposals during their respective meetings with Mr. Pinola and Ms. Munson. Messrs. Fox and Park kept the W. P. Carey board of directors updated
about their discussions with the CPA:18 - Global directors.
On July 12, 2021, members of W. P Carey’s senior management met by videoconference with representatives from BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA
Securities”), which had previously acted as a financial advisor to W. P. Carey. The purpose of the meeting was to evaluate a potential transaction
involving CPA:18 - Global.
Later the same day, the same members of W. P Carey’s senior management team met by videoconference with representatives from Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC. Likewise, the purpose of this meeting involved the evaluation of a potential transaction with CPA:18 - Global.
On August 27, 2021, representatives of W. P. Carey made a presentation to the independent directors of CPA:18 - Global (the ""CPA:18 Independent
Directors"") that included an offer from W. P. Carey to acquire CPA:18 - Global in a merger transaction in which CPA:18 - Global stockholders would
receive a combination of cash and W. P. Carey Common Stock with a total value of $9.40 per CPA:18 - Global share (the ""August W. P. Carey
Proposal""). The presentation did not specify the proposed allocation of the merger consideration between stock and cash, nor did it specify how
the share exchange ratio would be determined. The presentation stated that the August W. P. Carey Proposal would expire on September 30, 2021.
The CPA:18 Independent Directors had not solicited the August W. P. Carey Proposal and had not previously commenced a review of potential
liquidity events for CPA:18 - Global at the time the August W. P. Carey Proposal was presented to them.
Following receipt of the August W. P. Carey Proposal, the CPA:18 Independent Directors discussed forming a special committee to evaluate
possible liquidity alternatives, including the August W. P. Carey Proposal. The CPA:18 Independent Directors discussed the need for a special
committee to retain independent legal and financial advisors and discussed potential candidates for those roles. They also discussed the
appropriate public disclosure to be made regarding their intention to consider liquidity alternatives, including the August W. P. Carey Proposal.
On August 31, 2021, W. P. Carey filed a Schedule 13D amendment reporting its holdings of CPA:18 Common Stock and noting that it made a
proposal to CPA:18 - Global regarding a business combination transaction. Also, on August 31, 2021, CPA:18 - Global filed a Current Report on
Form 8-K reporting the CPA:18 Independent Directors' intention to evaluate liquidity alternatives for CPA:18 Global, including the August W. P.
Carey Proposal.

On September 1, 2021, the CPA:18 Independent Directors retained Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP (""Troutman Pepper"") to serve as legal
counsel to the to-be-formed special committee of CPA:18 Independent Directors.
On September 9, 2021, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors formed the CPA:18 Special Committee and delegated to it the authority to review
possible liquidity alternatives. The CPA:18 Special Committee was delegated the sole authority to negotiate the terms of a transaction and to make a
recommendation to the full CPA:18 - Global board of directors, which could include a recommendation to approve or reject any transaction,
including the August W. P. Carey Proposal. The CPA:18 Special Committee was authorized to retain, at CPA:18 - Global's expense, its own legal,
financial and other advisors. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors appointed Elizabeth P. Munson and Richard J. Pinola, each of whom is a CPA:18
Independent Director, to the CPA:18 Special Committee, with Mr. Pinola appointed as chairman. The board of directors determined to pay each
member of the CPA:18 Special Committee a retainer of $75,000, to be paid in advance, and to pay the Chairman of the CPA:18 Special Committee an
additional retainer of $15,000, to be paid in advance. In addition, the board of directors determined, should the authorization of the CPA:18 Special
Committee continue after September 9, 2022, to pay each member of the CPA:18 Special Committee an annual retainer of $75,000, to be paid on such
date, and to pay the Chairman of the CPA:18 Special Committee an additional annual retainer of $15,000, to be paid on such date.
On September 9, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Clifford Chance US LLP (""Clifford
Chance""), counsel to CPA:18 - Global, and Troutman Pepper. The CPA:18 Special Committee reviewed its mandate and the applicable duties of a
special committee under Maryland law and CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents. The CPA:18 Special Committee discussed retaining a
financial advisor to assist it in its evaluation of strategic alternatives for CPA:18 - Global and decided to seek proposals and entertain presentations
from investment banking firms. The CPA:18 Special Committee also discussed CPA:18 - Global's redemption queue. On August 31, 2020, the board
of directors of CPA:18 - Global had voted that CPA:18 - Global would generally limit the amount of cash available for its quarterly redemptions to the
amount reinvested by CPA:18 Stockholders in its dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and would reduce its quarterly distribution rate as of the
second quarter of 2020 in order to preserve cash in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 9, 2021, approximately $32.9 million of
redemption requests were pending. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined to monitor the queue and to consider ways to address it in
connection with the review of liquidity alternatives for CPA:18 - Global.
On September 29, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting at the offices of Clifford Chance. Representatives from Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper participated in the meeting. During this meeting, the CPA:18 Special Committee interviewed candidates to serve as financial
advisor to the CPA:18 Special Committee. During the presentations, each candidate reviewed a range of potential strategic alternatives for CPA:18 -
Global.
On September 30, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting with representatives of Clifford Chance and Troutman Pepper. The CPA:18
Special Committee discussed the presentations received from financial advisor candidates, as well as the disclosures made by each candidate firm
regarding any relationships such firm had with W. P. Carey. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined that engaging Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
(""Morgan Stanley"") to advise the CPA:18 Special Committee was in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and confirmed that Morgan Stanley was
independent for the purposes of serving as the CPA:18 Special Committee's financial advisor. The CPA:18 Special Committee approved the retention
of Morgan Stanley as financial advisor to the CPA:18 Special Committee, subject to entering into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley. The
CPA:18 Special Committee noted that there was no imperative for CPA:18 - Global to undertake any liquidity event at that time. CPA:18 - Global's
assets were continuing to generate sufficient cash flow to enable the company to cover its reduced distribution rate and the performance of certain
assets that had been experiencing difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic was improving.
On October 7, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee and Morgan Stanley entered into an engagement letter to formally retain Morgan Stanley as the
financial advisor to the CPA:18 Special Committee. Following this, the CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to begin its financial
review and valuation work on CPA:18 - Global, including analyses regarding potential strategic alternatives.

On October 11, 2021, Mr. Park and representatives of Morgan Stanley had a call regarding the August W. P. Carey Proposal. They discussed at a
high level the potential merger consideration, including the mix of cash and stock, with the potential to reduce the cash portion, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, by the amount of any special dividends paid by CPA:18 - Global prior to the end of the year.
On November 2, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper, to discuss the status of Morgan Stanley's work in support of the CPA:18 Special Committee's evaluation of strategic alternatives
for CPA:18 - Global, including the August W. P. Carey Proposal. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined that the August W. P. Carey Proposal
was not a compelling opportunity for CPA:18 - Global and its stockholders, and that the scope of the CPA:18 Special Committee's evaluation
process included a full range of alternatives. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined to continue its review of a range of strategic liquidity
alternatives for CPA:18 - Global and the optimum timing of pursuing any particular alternative. The CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan
Stanley to continue its analyses of the current value of CPA:18 - Global and potential strategic alternatives available to CPA:18 - Global. The CPA:18
Special Committee also instructed Morgan Stanley to review and report on CPA:18 - Global's redemption queue and ways to potentially address the
queue using CPA:18 - Global's available cash, cash from asset sales and other potential alternatives.
On November 19, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. The Morgan Stanley representatives provided an update of their work on behalf of the CPA:18 Special Committee. The Morgan
Stanley representatives also updated the CPA:18 Special Committee on material discussions they had with representatives of W. P. Carey regarding
W. P. Carey's proposal and W. P. Carey's plans to address the pending redemption queue. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee decided
to defer further evaluation of strategic alternatives until after the December 9, 2021 regular quarterly meeting of the board of directors of CPA:18 -
Global. The Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform W. P. Carey that the August W. P. Carey Proposal was not acceptable to the
CPA:18 Special Committee and to point out that the proposal had expired in accordance with its terms.
On November 23, 2021, Mr. Fox and representatives of Morgan Stanley had a call to discuss the August W. P. Carey Proposal and whether and to
what extent W. P. Carey was willing to increase its offer price.
On December 9, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting in the offices of W. P. Carey, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley,
Clifford Chance and Troutman Pepper. This meeting followed a regular quarterly meeting of the CPA:18 - Global board of directors. Mr. Pinola
updated the group on certain positive business developments in CPA:18 - Global's portfolio that had been reported at the board meeting as well as
the steps that CPA:18 - Global had undertaken to address its pending redemption queue in full. Mr. Pinola then reported that Mr. Fox made an oral
proposal to increase the August W. P. Carey Proposal to a per share price of $10.05, which would be reduced by a special dividend that CPA:18 -
Global expected to pay in the amount of $0.20 per share before year end. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee determined to request that
W. P. Carey put its new proposal in a written document that would provide greater detail about the new proposal. After receipt of the written
proposal, the CPA:18 Special Committee and advisors would determine if it was sufficient for the CPA:18 Special Committee to continue exploring
strategic alternatives.
On December 16, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Troutman Pepper and
Clifford Chance. The CPA:18 Special Committee and advisors discussed a written proposal received from W. P. Carey on December 13, 2021 to
acquire CPA:18 - Global at a price of $9.85 per share, payable in $1.75 of cash and the balance in W. P. Carey Common Stock (the ""December W. P.
Carey Proposal""). The $9.85 per share price reflected an offer price of $10.05 minus a $0.20 per share dividend that CPA:18 - Global had recently
declared. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee determined that the proposal lacked detail on the nature of the exchange ratio and was
not acceptable in its current form. The CPA:18 Special Committee requested that Morgan Stanley review the proposal in detail and the respective
valuations of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey in order to determine whether the CPA:18 Special Committee should continue to explore strategic
alternatives and should make a counterproposal to W. P. Carey.

On December 17, 2021, Mr. Fox and a representative of Morgan Stanley had a call to follow-up on the December 16 CPA:18 Special Committee
meeting and the committee’s preliminary reaction to the December W. P. Carey Proposal.
On January 7, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Troutman Pepper and Clifford
Chance. The Morgan Stanley representatives provided a detailed valuation analysis regarding the December W. P. Carey Proposal. The Morgan
Stanley representatives indicated that their view of the proposal had become more favorable based on their work since the last meeting of the
CPA:18 Special Committee, but they noted that the proposal lacked key details such as the nature of the exchange ratio. After discussing next
steps, the CPA:18 Special Committee expressed a preference for greater transaction price certainty in the form of more cash and decided to seek an
improved bid from W. P. Carey rather than to make a counterproposal. After extensive discussion among the members of the CPA:18 Special
Committee and the Morgan Stanley representatives, the CPA:18 Special Committee concurred with the recommendation of Morgan Stanley that
Morgan Stanley should continue to try to improve the December W. P. Carey Proposal.
Following the January 7 meeting, at the direction of the CPA:18 Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to W. P. Carey that
the December W. P. Carey Proposal was not compelling. The Morgan Stanley representatives recommended that W. P. Carey improve both the
amount of the proposal and the amount of cash consideration, but did not communicate a specific counterproposal, as directed by the CPA:18
Special Committee. Specifically, on January 12, 2022, Mr. Fox and a representative of Morgan Stanley had a call to discuss certain information
regarding the offer price, including whether any further increases in the offer price from W. P. Carey could include an increased cash component.
Mr. Fox and Mr. Pinola met in person on January 18, 2022, to continue discussions of the offer price. During the meeting, Mr. Pinola communicated
to Mr. Fox a verbal counterproposal of a $10.50 per share offer price. Mr. Fox further countered with an offer price of $10.25 per share. Mr. Fox and
Mr. Pinola also spoke by telephone on a January 20, 2022, regarding the trailing volume weighted-average price (""VWAP"") to be used to value the
price of W. P. Carey’s common stock for the stock portion of the merger consideration, W. P. Carey’s partial cash offer of $1.75 per share, and the
viability of a 30-day “go-shop” period. Mr. Fox also expressed W. P. Carey’s desire to maintain full discretion to sell assets and prepay mortgages of
CPA:18 - Global during the executory period of the Merger Agreement. Later the same day, Mr. Fox sent an email to Mr. Pinola, attaching a high-
level overview of proposed transaction terms, which reflected, among other things, a proposal from W. P. Carey for $10.35 per share, $2.00 of which
would be payable in cash and the balance payable in W. P. Carey Common Stock at a fixed exchange ratio based on the trailing 20-day VWAP of a
share of W. P. Carey Common Stock (the ""First January W. P. Carey Proposal"").
On January 21, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. Mr. Pinola updated the group on the recent discussions he had with Mr. Fox that resulted in an improved proposal from W. P.
Carey. The Morgan Stanley representatives reviewed the First January W. P. Carey Proposal. After extensive discussion among the members of the
CPA:18 Special Committee, the CPA:18 Special Committee authorized Morgan Stanley to engage with W. P. Carey and seek to further improve the
proposal in terms of price and price certainty. Morgan Stanley representatives subsequently communicated this position to W. P. Carey as directed.
On a call between Mr. Fox and a Morgan Stanley representative on January 24, 2022, the Morgan Stanley representative relayed a counterproposal
of the CPA:18 Special Committee for a revised offer price with an implied value of $10.45 per share, $3.00 of which would be payable in cash. The
representative also expressed the CPA:18 Special Committee’s reluctance to entertain an exchange ratio based on a 20-day trailing VWAP and
requested a two-tiered termination fee, which would provide for payment by CPA:18 - Global of a lower percentage fee if it were to terminate the
Merger Agreement as a result of a superior proposal made within the first thirty days following execution of the agreement by the parties.
On January 26, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. The CPA:18 Special Committee noted the receipt of a revised proposal from W. P. Carey reflecting (i) an increase to $2.75 per share
in the cash component of the $10.35
37
Table of Contents
per share price; (ii) a potential increase in the cash component to $5.00; (iii) potential asset sales by CPA:18 - Global prior to closing of the proposal
transaction; and (iv) an exchange ratio for the stock component to be determined (the ""Second January W. P. Carey Proposal""). The Morgan
Stanley representatives reported on discussions they had with representatives of W. P. Carey. After extensive discussion among the members of
the CPA:18 Special Committee and its advisors, the CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform W. P. Carey's representatives
that the CPA:18 Special Committee would view the per share price of $10.35 favorably if the cash component were increased to $5.00 and the parties
could agree on a satisfactory exchange ratio.
Over the next several days, representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of W. P. Carey engaged in discussions regarding the Second
January W. P. Carey Proposal. Representatives of W. P. Carey also contacted Mr. Pinola directly to discuss the proposal.
On February 7, 2022, DLA Piper LLP (US) (“DLA Piper”) (legal advisors to W. P. Carey) sent a draft merger agreement to Clifford Chance. The draft
agreement reflected an increase in the cash component to $3.00 but still reflected an overall price of $10.35 per share of CPA:18 Common Stock. The
draft included a right for W. P. Carey unilaterally to cause CPA:18 - Global to sell certain assets prior to the closing of the merger at prices
determined by W. P. Carey, and to extend the closing date for up to 30 days to allow W. P. Carey to cause CPA:18 - Global to complete the asset
sales. The draft agreement provided for a waiver of certain fees and distributions that would potentially be payable to W. P. Carey as advisor in
connection with a merger of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey. The draft also contemplated termination fees of 1.5% for certain alternative
transactions proposed by bidders identified during a go-shop process and 3.5% for other alternative transactions.
On February 9, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. The group discussed the draft merger agreement received from DLA Piper. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee
instructed Morgan Stanley to inform W. P. Carey that (i) the CPA:18 Special Committee would view the $10.35 price favorably if the cash component
were increased to $5.00; and (ii) the CPA:18 Special Committee would be reasonable in considering the provisions in the draft agreement that
appeared to be intended to provide W. P. Carey with flexibility to generate cash from asset sales to fund an increased cash component of the merger
consideration.
On February 17, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. Mr. Pinola and the representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on recent discussions they had with representatives of W. P.
Carey in which the W. P. Carey representatives offered to increase the cash component from $3.00 to $3.50, while maintaining a $10.35 price per
share. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to seek to improve the price per share to $10.45.
On February 18, 2022, Mr. Fox contacted Mr. Pinola and proposed that W. P. Carey would acquire CPA:18 - Global at a price of $10.45 per share, of
which $3.00 would be paid in cash. After discussion among the CPA:18 Special Committee and its advisors, the CPA:18 Special Committee
determined that the price and its components were acceptable provided that a satisfactory definitive merger agreement could be reached. Clifford
Chance circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement for review by DLA Piper. The revised draft contemplated that any permitted asset sales
prior to closing would have to meet minimum reserve prices, W. P. Carey would have no unilateral right to extend the closing date, the termination
fees would be 1.0% and 3.0%, and any termination fee would be credited against advisory fees and special general partner distributions payable to
W. P. Carey in the event of a third-party transaction.
Between February 18, 2022 and February 27, 2022, representatives of Clifford Chance and Troutman Pepper, on behalf of CPA:18 - Global and the
CPA:18 Special Committee, and DLA Piper, on behalf of W. P. Carey, exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and held several negotiation
sessions regarding the issues described above, and other terms of the merger agreement and ancillary agreements.
On February 23, 2022, the W. P. Carey board of directors met via videoconference, at which representatives of W. P. Carey’s senior management,
BofA Securities and DLA Piper were present. At this meeting, representatives of W. P. Carey’s senior management updated the W. P. Carey board of
directors on the status of the ongoing
38
Table of Contents
discussions and negotiations regarding the potential transaction with CPA:18 - Global, including a summary of the key transaction terms in the near
final merger agreement, a summary of the key open issues that remained the subject of ongoing negotiations, and management’s views on the
transaction. Representatives of BofA Securities then reviewed with the W. P. Carey board of directors the key financial terms of the merger
agreement.
On February 25, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. A representative of Venable LLP joined the meeting to advise the members of CPA:18 Special Committee as to their duties under
Maryland law with respect to the proposed transaction and related matters. The CPA:18 Special Committee then reviewed the benefits and
considerations of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Clifford Chance next reviewed an overview of the proposed transaction, including
the material provisions contained in a February 24, 2022 draft merger agreement prepared on behalf of CPA:18 - Global. The Clifford Chance
representatives highlighted the issues that remained open between the parties. These issues primarily related to determination of the share
exchange ratio, W. P. Carey's right to extend the closing date and the amounts of the reserve prices for asset sales.
The Morgan Stanley representatives next discussed in detail with the CPA:18 Special Committee valuation analyses of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey,
and the proposed transaction, together with supporting data. The Morgan Stanley representatives provided an overview of the proposed merger, a
valuation analysis of CPA:18 - Global, the W. P. Carey pro forma capitalization after the merger, and various accretion (dilution) analyses of the
proposed merger, noting, among other benefits, that the proposed transaction would be accretive to CPA:18 Stockholders on a dividends basis,
assuming reinvestment in W. P. Carey common stock of the cash portion of the consideration received. The CPA:18 Special Committee then
discussed the various alternatives to the proposed transaction which it had previously considered, including maintaining the status quo and not
pursuing a liquidity alternative at the current time, a sale to a third party for cash, an initial public offering or stock exchange listing of CPA:18 -
Global (including the internalization of CPA:18 - Global's management function), the liquidation of CPA:18 - Global's assets, and the consideration of
potential acquisition bidders in addition to W. P. Carey. After discussion, and with input from its financial and legal advisors, the CPA:18 Special
Committee concluded that the available alternatives were not as favorable to CPA:18 Stockholders as the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey if it
could be successfully negotiated to a satisfactory conclusion, and that additional bidders could be effectively pursued through the go-shop
process permitted by the merger agreement.
The CPA:18 Special Committee then determined to continue its evaluation of the proposed transaction and directed its advisors to seek to finalize
the terms of the merger agreement in order for the CPA:18 Special Committee to make a determination of whether it would recommend to the CPA:18
- Global board that the proposed transaction was advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, was fair and
reasonable to CPA:18 - Global, and was on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties.
The parties' legal and financial advisors proceeded to seek to finalize the terms of the proposed merger and merger agreement over the next couple
of days.
On February 26, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. Clifford Chance and Morgan Stanley provided updates on the remaining open issues, which primarily centered on W. P. Carey's
desire for a right to extend the closing date in order to permit the closing of the sale of a specified portfolio and the consideration that should be
paid to CPA:18 - Global's stockholders for such right. The CPA:18 Special Committee provided direction to the advisors to continue to adhere to the
CPA:18 Special Committee's position that the cash portion of the merger consideration should be increased by an accrued amount if there were to
be a delay of the closing date. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed alternative potential exchange ratios based on various VWAP
calculations and the CPA:18 Special Committee selected 0.0978x as its preferred exchange ratio. Finally, the CPA 18: Special Committee and its
advisors discussed the current global circumstances resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and their potential impact on W. P. Carey and
CPA:18 Global. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee, with the concurrence of its advisors, determined that the current global
circumstances did not make the proposed merger transaction inadvisable if it could be successfully negotiated to a satisfactory conclusion.

Table of Contents
On February 27, 2022, representatives of Clifford Chance distributed substantially final versions of the Merger Agreement and ancillary documents
to the CPA:18 Special Committee, indicating the resolution of the open issues that had been discussed with the CPA:18 Special Committee at its
February 25 and 26, 2022 meetings. Representatives of Morgan Stanley presented their valuation analyses, which were substantially similar to
those reviewed with the CPA:18 Special Committee on February 25, 2022.
On February 27, 2022, a meeting of the W. P. Carey board of directors, at which representatives of W. P. Carey’s senior management, BofA Securities
and DLA Piper were present, was held via videoconference. Representatives of W. P. Carey’s senior management, representatives of BofA
Securities and representatives of DLA Piper summarized the negotiations that had taken place and reviewed the Per Share Merger Consideration to
be paid by W. P. Carey. Representatives of DLA Piper reviewed with the W. P. Carey board the terms of the Merger Agreement. Representatives of
BofA Securities reviewed with the W. P. Carey board of directors the key financial terms of the Merger. The W. P Carey board discussed the terms of
the agreements and the representatives of W. P. Carey management, BofA Securities and DLA Piper answered the W. P. Carey directors’ questions.
After discussion and taking into account the factors described under “-W. P. Carey’s Reasons for the Merger,” beginning on page 41, the W. P.
Carey board determined by unanimous vote that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, were
advisable, fair, and in the best interests of W. P. Carey and its stockholders, and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
On February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and
Troutman Pepper. The CPA:18 Special Committee reviewed the final terms of the proposed transaction and the proposed resolution of all material
open issues. The CPA:18 Special Committee then reviewed Morgan Stanley's disclosure of relationships with W. P. Carey and confirmed that the
CPA:18 Special Committee was satisfied with the independence of Morgan Stanley. The Morgan Stanley representatives then summarized their
updated valuation analyses of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and the Merger, reviewed the list of third parties initially anticipated to be contacted in
the go-shop process, and confirmed that the data room to be used for the go-shop process was populated and ready for use. At the request of the
CPA:18 Special Committee, Morgan Stanley then delivered to the CPA:18 Special Committee its oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing)
that, as of February 27, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley's opinion, the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point
of view to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of Excluded Shares).
The CPA:18 Special Committee then discussed the various benefits and other considerations respecting the proposed transaction, and, after
discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are
advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global
and on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties. The CPA:18 Special Committee also determined
that CPA:18 - Global's distribution reinvestment and redemption programs would be suspended until the closing of the Merger, except that special
circumstances redemptions in respect of a stockholder who had died or become disabled would continue. By unanimous vote, the CPA:18 Special
Committee adopted resolutions making declarations to the same effect and recommended to the CPA:18 - Global board of directors that it adopt
resolutions and direct the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be submitted for consideration at a special
meeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders.
Immediately following the CPA:18 Special Committee meeting on February 27, 2022, the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global held a meeting to
approve the transaction with W. P. Carey, at which the financial and legal advisors of the CPA:18 Special Committee were also present.
Representatives from Clifford Chance described the resolutions that had been adopted by the CPA:18 Special Committee at the meeting prior to the
board meeting. The CPA:18 Special Committee informed the board that the Morgan Stanley fairness opinion was for the information of the board as
well as the CPA:18 Special Committee. Following deliberations, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent
directors) determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of
CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and on terms and conditions at
40
Table of Contents
least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors adopted resolutions making declarations
to the same effect, among other resolutions, and directed the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be
submitted for consideration at a special meeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders. Jason E. Fox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey,
abstained from voting on the matters.
On Sunday, February 27, 2022, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global executed and delivered the Merger Agreement and certain ancillary documents.
On February 28, 2022, W. P. Carey issued a press release announcing the proposed transaction.
On February 28, 2022, CPA:18 - Global issued a press release announcing the proposed transaction.
Commencing on February 28, 2022, representatives from Morgan Stanley, under the direction of the CPA:18 Special Committee, contacted a total of
19 strategic and financial firms that might have an interest in submitting a proposal to acquire CPA:18 - Global during the go-shop period. These
contacts resulted in 5 parties negotiating and entering into confidentiality agreements with CPA:18 - Global and receiving access to the diligence
materials in the virtual data room.
On March 4, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance
and Troutman Pepper. The representatives from Morgan Stanley provided an update on the market reaction to the announcement of the proposed

After careful consideration, W. P. Carey's board of directors, by a vote at a meeting held on February 27, 2022, determined that the Merger is
advisable and in the best interests of W. P. Carey and its stockholders, approved the Merger and the Stock Issuance. In its evaluation, the W. P.
Carey board of directors consulted with W. P. Carey's senior management and legal and financial advisors, and considered a number of factors that
the board of directors believed supported its decision, including the following material factors:
Strategic Benefits
•the Merger is expected to be immediately accretive to the real estate segment of the combined company's Adjusted Funds From Operations
(""AFFO"") per share;
•the Merger improves W. P. Carey's earnings quality by replacing investment management fee streams with stable, higher-value real estate rental
income and increases the percentage of W. P. Carey’s dividend covered by real estate rental income;
•the consummation of the Merger will substantially complete W. P. Carey's long-term strategy to exit the investment management business,
simplifying operations and future reporting disclosures;
•given that W. P. Carey and its affiliates act as CPA:18 - Global's advisor and manage the day-to-day activities of CPA:18 - Global, the Merger would
not require real estate due diligence that would otherwise occur with an unrelated third party and significantly reduces integration risks;
•the high likelihood that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner given the commitment of both parties to complete the Merger pursuant to
their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, the absence of any significant closing conditions under the Merger Agreement, other
than the CPA:18
41Table of Contents
Stockholder Approval and third-party consents, and the fact that W. P. Carey's obligation to consummate the Merger is not subject to any
financing contingency;
•the expectation that, upon completion of the Merger, W. P. Carey’s existing stockholders will own approximately 93% of the W. P. Carey Common
Stock;
•provisions in the Merger Agreement including the requirement of CPA:18 - Global to pay W. P. Carey a termination fee if the Merger Agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances;
Portfolio Benefits
•CPA:18 - Global owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is aligned with W. P. Carey's existing portfolio based on asset type, tenant industry
and geographic locations;
•the Merger will further increase W. P. Carey’s portfolio diversification and improve certain metrics including decreasing its top ten tenant
concentration;
•W. P. Carey will acquire a portfolio of operating self-storage assets that provide compelling opportunities for potential upside;
•as a result of the Merger, the remaining joint ventures between W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global on seven properties will be collapsed;
Size and Scale Benefits
•the Merger increases W. P. Carey's size and scale resulting in a combined company equity market capitalization of approximately $15.8 billion and a
combined company total enterprise value of approximately $23.4 billion;
•the Merger will further solidify W. P. Carey as one of the largest REITs in the U.S. REIT Index (RMZ);
•the Merger will improve operational efficiency by spreading W. P. Carey's general and administrative expenses over a larger owned real estate asset
base;
Balance Sheet Benefits
•the combined company is expected to maintain W. P. Carey's strong and flexible investment-grade balance sheet;
•the Merger is not expected to meaningfully alter balance sheet metrics of W. P. Carey, due to the relative size of CPA:18 - Global and its leverage
profile;
•the Merger presents the opportunity for potential interest-cost savings and additional accretion from refinancing opportunities; and
•the Merger is expected to improve W. P. Carey's overall cost of capital and incrementally increase stock liquidity.
W. P. Carey's board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the Merger:
•the Merger is expected to lower overall AFFO per share due to the reduction in asset management fees and reimbursements paid by CPA:18 -
Global;
•the temporary increase in the ratio of secured debt to gross assets and certain leverage metrics as a result of the Merger;
•the possibility that the Merger may not be completed, or that completion may be unduly delayed, for reasons beyond the control of W. P. Carey or
CPA:18 - Global;
42
Table of Contents
•the risk that failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the financial results of W. P. Carey and the price of its common stock;
•the possibility that the value per share for W. P. Carey Stockholders could be reduced immediately following the Merger;
•the substantial costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Merger;
•certain CPA:18 - Global assets have higher risk profiles or may not be aligned with W. P. Carey's long-term investment strategy;
•the obligation of W. P. Carey to pay certain expenses if the Merger is terminated under certain conditions;
•the risk that the efforts necessary to complete the Merger could result in a disruption in the operations of W. P. Carey by, among other things,
diverting management focus and other resources of W. P. Carey from operational matters, strategic opportunities and its day-to-day business;
•the risk that certain anticipated benefits of the transaction might not be realized on the expected timeframe or at all; and
•the other relevant factors to W. P. Carey described under the section titled ""Risk Factors.""
W. P. Carey did not quantify any anticipated cost savings with respect to the Merger since they were expected to be relatively immaterial in light of
the size of the overall proposed transaction given that CPA:18 - Global is managed by W. P. Carey, does not have any employees, and has very little
in terms of operational costs or overhead aside from the advisory fees paid to W. P. Carey. The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by

CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger
At a meeting on February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors) and the CPA:18
Special Committee adopted resolutions declaring that the Merger is (A) advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the stockholders
of CPA:18 - Global, (B) fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and (C) on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from
unaffiliated third parties, and directing that the Merger be submitted for consideration at a special meeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders. Jason E.
Fox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, abstained from voting on the matters. In making their determination, the CPA:18 - Global
board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee considered a variety of factors, including:
•the expectation that the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey will provide liquidity to CPA:18 - Global's stockholders by delivering to them cash
and shares in a publicly traded company with a broad stockholder base, and with no lock-ups or other restrictions on transfer on the shares;
•the Per Share Merger Consideration implies a premium of 17% and 15% to CPA:18 - Global's most recently published estimated NAV per share of
$9.07 at September 30, 2021, based on the closing price of W. P. Carey Common Stock of $77.66 on February 25, 2022 (the last trading day prior to
the announcement of the Merger) and the 3-day volume-weighted average price of $76.17 for the three days ending on and including February 25,
2022, respectively;
•the dividend that the CPA:18 Stockholders will receive on the stock consideration, based on W. P. Carey's existing dividend rate will be slightly
increased;
•the cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is fixed and won't decline based on declines in the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock;

$23.4 billion and total market capitalization of approximately $15.7 billion, and a more diversified portfolio of approximately 1,338 properties with 164

balance sheet, the combined company is expected to have greater operating and financial flexibility and better access to capital markets with a lower
cost of capital than CPA:18 - Global on a standalone basis;

•the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee each concluded, after consideration and review with its legal and
financial advisors, that the transaction with W. P. Carey was superior to other possible liquidity alternatives for a number of reasons, including the
view that:
◦the current opportunities for an initial public offering or a public listing are not favorable, particularly for diversified REITs that are externally
managed;
◦it could be challenging to retain a management team in order to pursue a listing as an internally managed REIT;
◦a sale of CPA:18 - Global's entire portfolio to unrelated third parties may involve difficulties in obtaining consents from lenders and may require
Advisor Closing Amounts;
◦there was a low probability that a third party would have the desire or ability to merge with CPA:18 - Global or otherwise acquire its entire portfolio
and related debt at a value comparable to the proposed Merger, including as a result of the large size and diversified nature of the portfolio in
addition to the joint interests of CPA:18 and W. P. Carey (and the lack of response from third parties during a go-shop period, which confirmed this
view);
◦a liquidation over an extended period would require CPA:18 - Global to continue to incur expenses, including fixed operating expenses that are not
tied to the size of CPA:18 - Global's asset base, which would reduce the total net amount realized from the liquidation; and
◦the costs associated with separate sales of each property could become significant, thus decreasing returns to CPA:18 Stockholders;
•after the proposed transaction, the combined company would have greater geographic diversification and greater tenant diversification than
CPA:18 - Global on a standalone basis, which could provide the combined company with greater cash flow stability;
•the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee each believe that the quality of the combined company's earnings will be
improved by the Merger because substantially all of the combined company's AFFO will come from recurring real estate income; this improvement
may result in the combined company trading at a higher multiple of earnings;
•the projected payout ratio will decrease, resulting in dividends of a higher quality, which may result in greater dividend growth over time than
without the Merger;
•CPA:18 Stockholders will have ownership of approximately 7% of the combined company, and continued ownership of shares in the combined
company will provide the opportunity for CPA:18 Stockholders to benefit from potential increases in the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock after
the closing date;
•there is no active public trading market for CPA:18 Common Stock and CPA:18 - Global's redemption plan includes numerous restrictions that limit

2021 (absent it being a special circumstances redemption);
•the Per Share Merger Consideration and the other terms of the Merger Agreement resulted from arm's length negotiations between the CPA:18
Special Committee and W. P. Carey, with the assistance of their respective advisors;
•W. P. Carey will continue to be self-managed, thereby eliminating the external advisory structure under which CPA:18 - Global presently operates;

•the ability of CPA:18 - Global under the Merger Agreement, after the go-shop period, to engage in negotiations with third parties in response to
unsolicited acquisition proposals under certain circumstances;
•the ability of CPA:18 - Global to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal prior to the time that the CPA:18 Stockholders
approve the Merger, subject to payment of a termination fee of $15.7 million (1.0% of the equity value of the Merger) for a transaction with a
qualified third party pursuant to the go-shop procedures and $47.0 million (3.0% of the equity value of the Merger) for a transaction with a third
party as a result of an unsolicited offer outside the go-shop procedures;

creditable against the Advisor Closing Amounts payable to W. P. Carey;

payment of the applicable termination fee;

procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley, as set forth in

to CPA:18 - Global if the Merger does not close;

•the possibility that the transaction with W. P. Carey would not be completed or may be delayed, and the possible adverse effects on the future

•the risk that a different liquidity alternative or a decision not to enter into a current liquidity transaction could ultimately have been more beneficial
to CPA:18 Stockholders than the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey;
•the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the solicitation of a competing transaction after the go-shop period and the requirement under the
Merger Agreement that CPA:18 - Global pay W. P. Carey a termination fee of either $15.7 million (1.0% of the equity value of the Merger) or $47.0
million (3.0% of the equity value of the Merger) depending on the circumstances (which, in each case, would be credited against the Advisor
Closing Amounts), which may deter third parties from making a competing offer for CPA:18 - Global prior to completion of the Merger;
•the risk that W. P. Carey may exercise its right under the Merger Agreement to cause CPA:18 - Global or any subsidiary of CPA:18 - Global to enter
into a definitive agreement to sell, or to sell, without the separate consent of the CPA:18 Special Committee, certain specified properties permitted to
be sold after the go-shop period and before the closing of the Merger;
•the risk that W. P. Carey may exercise its right under the Merger Agreement to defer the closing date in order to first complete the sale of CPA:18 -
Global's Iberian student housing portfolio;
•the fact that the Exchange Ratio is fixed, meaning that there is no walk-away/termination right as a result of declines in W. P. Carey's stock price
before the closing of the Merger;
•the fact that CPA: 18-Global Stockholders will not receive future dividends on the cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration;
•the risk that the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the Merger may not be fully realized;
•the risk that the price of W. P. Carey common stock will decline after the closing date;
•the risk that the dividend of W. P. Carey will decline after the closing date;
•the expenses to be incurred in connection with pursuing the Merger;
•the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of CPA:18 - Global's business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the date of
the consummation of the proposed Merger; and
•the other relevant factors to CPA:18 - Global described under the section titled ""Risk Factors.""
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee is not intended to
be exhaustive but rather summarizes the material factors considered by the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee. In
view of the wide variety of factors considered, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee did not find it practicable
to quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to
different factors. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee considered the positive and negative factors relating to
the Merger and the related transactions and believed the negative factors to be materially outweighed by the positive factors.

and reputation, and its knowledge of the business and affairs of CPA:18 - Global. As part of this engagement, the CPA:18 Special Committee
requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the holders of shares
of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the shares held by W. P. Carey or any subsidiary of W. P. Carey (which shares we refer to as
Excluded Shares)). On February 27, 2022, at a meeting of the CPA:18 Special Committee, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion to the CPA:18 Special Committee, dated February 27, 2022, that, as of such date
and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock
(other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the Excluded Shares).
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated February 27, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B, and is
hereby incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley in rendering its opinion. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to, and should, read Morgan Stanley’s opinion and this section summarizing Morgan
Stanley’s opinion carefully and in their entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the CPA:18 Special Committee, in its capacity as such,
and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of CPA:18
Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the Excluded Shares), as of the date of the opinion, and did not address any other
aspects or implications of the Merger. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any stockholder of CPA:18 -
Global as to how to act or vote in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did
not in any manner address the prices at which the W. P. Carey Common Stock will trade following consummation of the Merger or at any time.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
•reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey,
respectively;
•reviewed certain internal financial statements and other business, financial and operating data, concerning CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey,
respectively;

Merger, with senior executives of W. P. Carey;

Table of Contents
•reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for W. P. Carey Common Stock;
•compared the financial performance of CPA:18 - Global with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with CPA:18 - Global, and
their securities;
•reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;

advisors;
•reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and
•performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to it by CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, and formed a substantial
basis for its opinion. With respect to the financial projections, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits
anticipated from the Merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the respective managements of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey of the future financial performance of CPA:18 - Global
and W. P. Carey. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Merger will be treated as a
tax-free reorganization, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ in
any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the
necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will
be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Merger. Morgan Stanley relied
upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey of: (i) the strategic, financial and
other benefits expected to result from the Merger; and (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey.
Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered
into or amended in connection therewith, including, without limitation, any terms, aspects or implications of any related transactions. Morgan
Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the
assessment of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan
Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of CPA:18 - Global’s officers,
directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
CPA:18 Common Stock in the transaction (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the Excluded Shares). Morgan Stanley was advised by the
CPA:18 Special Committee that W. P. Carey has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its formation as a REIT and Morgan Stanley has assumed that the Merger will not adversely
affect such status or operations of W. P. Carey. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
CPA:18 - Global or W. P. Carey, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on
financial, economic, market, tax and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of February 27, 2022.
Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not
assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition,

Summary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation
of its opinion letter to the CPA:18 Special Committee, dated February 27, 2022. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan
Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order
of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read
together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in
the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
Furthermore, mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to
below.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and relied upon certain financial
projections provided by the managements of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey and that are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the
“financial projections,” and extrapolations of such financial projections, as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus titled “Prospective Financial Information,” and certain financial projections based on Wall Street research.
Dividend Discount Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a dividend discount analysis to calculate a range of implied present values of the future forecasted dividends and an
estimated “terminal value” for CPA:18 Common Stock. The range was determined by adding:
•the present value (as of December 31, 2021) of estimated future dividends for CPA:18 - Global over a period of 60 months from January 1, 2022 to
December 31, 2026 based on CPA:18 - Global’s projected estimated dividends per share for those periods; and
•the present value (as of December 31, 2021) of an estimated “terminal value” of CPA:18 Common Stock at the end of the year 2026.
In performing its analysis, Morgan Stanley used a discount rate of 8.3% to 10.3%, derived from a cost of equity calculation utilizing the capital asset
pricing model. The terminal value for CPA:18 Common Stock was calculated by applying a selected range of terminal AFFO multiples of 16.0x to
18.0x, the midpoint of which was based on comparing the weighted average of historical next twelve months (NTM) AFFO trading multiples over
the last ten years of CPA:18 - Global’s Net Lease and Self-Storage REIT Peers, to Morgan Stanley’s calculation of estimated 2027 AFFO per share of
CPA:18 - Global of $0.58. CPA:18 - Global’s Net Lease REIT Peers consisted of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc., Lexington Realty Trust, STAG Industrial,
Inc., and W. P. Carey. CPA:18 - Global’s Self-Storage REIT peers include CubeSmart, Extra Space Storage Inc., Life Storage, Inc., National Storage
Affiliates Trust, and Public Storage. This analysis resulted in the following implied per share equity value range for CPA:18 - Global:

Comparable Public Companies Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a comparable company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar
companies that are publicly traded.

Table of Contents
Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared, using publicly available information, certain current and historical financial information for CPA:18 -
Global and financial projections with corresponding current and historical financial information, certain financial projections based on Wall Street
research reports, ratios and public market multiples for selected companies that, based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience,
share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics. The companies that were reviewed in connection with
this analysis were CPA:18 - Global’s Diversified Peers, Office / Industrial Peers and Self-Storage Peers.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated and analyzed the following statistics of each of CPA:18 - Global’s Diversified Peers, Office
/ Industrial Peers and Self-Storage Peers, based on the closing share prices on February 25, 2022 (the date of Morgan Stanley’s valuation analysis
of CPA:18 - Global) and publicly available financial data, for comparison purposes:
•such company’s estimated AFFO for calendar year 2022, based on publicly available equity research estimates;
•such company’s estimated gross asset value, or GAV, based on publicly available equity research estimates;
•such company’s estimated net asset value, or NAV, based on publicly available equity research estimates;
•the ratios of such company’s share price to estimated 2022 AFFO, estimated GAV and estimated NAV.
Morgan Stanley then used these multiple ranges to derive separate implied per share equity value reference ranges for CPA:18 - Global using each
of the metrics reviewed by applying the range derived from the comparable companies for each metric to the corresponding CPA:18 - Global metric,
as provided by CPA:18 - Global’s management.
Below are descriptions of the adjustments made to determine adjusted GAV and adjusted NAV for these metrics:
Adjusted Gross Asset Value
Morgan Stanley reviewed the GAV estimates of CPA:18 - Global’s assets prepared and published by Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. (“Stanger”) and
adjusted that estimate for other factors not included in their estimate, which adjustments were approved by the CPA:18 Special Committee. The
Stanger GAV estimate was $2.468 billion (as of September 30, 2021). Morgan Stanley then adjusted this estimate to reflect the estimated impact
(pursuant to data provided by CPA:18 - Global’s management) of the Iberian student housing portfolio call option (as described in further detail on
page 59 of this proxy statement/prospectus), planned dispositions of certain of CPA:18 - Global’s assets during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year
2021 and the first (1 ) quarter of fiscal year 2022, and impairment charges during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021 to devise an adjusted
GAV estimate of $2.443 billion.
Adjusted Net Asset Value
Morgan Stanley reviewed the NAV estimates for shares of CPA:18 Common Stock prepared and published by Stanger and adjusted that estimate for
other factors not included in their estimate, which adjustments were approved by the CPA:18 Special Committee. The Stanger NAV estimate for
shares of CPA:18 Common Stock was $9.07 (as of September 30, 2021). Morgan Stanley then adjusted this estimate to reflect the estimated impact
(pursuant to data provided by CPA:18 - Global’s management) of the Iberian student housing portfolio call option (as described in further detail on
page 59 of this proxy statement/prospectus), redemptions of the CPA:18 Common Stock during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021, planned
dispositions of certain of CPA:18 - Global’s assets during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the first (1 ) quarter of fiscal year 2022,
impairment charges during the fourth (4 ) quarter of fiscal year 2021, and change in share count attributable to CPA:18 - Global’s dividend
reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and as payment for W. P. Carey asset management fees to devise an adjusted NAV estimate of $9.01 per share of
CPA:18 Common Stock.

No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to CPA:18 - Global. In evaluating comparable companies, Morgan Stanley
made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, which are beyond CPA:18 - Global’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on CPA:18 - Global and the
industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of CPA:18 - Global,
the industry, or the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not, in itself, a meaningful
method of using comparable company data.
General
Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan
Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered.
Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of
the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight
than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges
of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of CPA:18
- Global or W. P. Carey.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond CPA:18 - Global’s or W. P. Carey’s control. These include,
among other things, the impact of competition on CPA:18 - Global’s businesses and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and the industry, and in the financial markets in
general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the
holders of the Excluded Shares) and in connection with the delivery of its opinion as of February 27, 2022, to the CPA:18 Special Committee. These
51
Table of Contents
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock might actually trade.
The Per Share Merger Consideration was determined through negotiations on an arms-length basis between the CPA:18 Special Committee and the
Board of Directors of W. P. Carey and was unanimously approved by each of CPA:18 - Global’s Board of Directors, following the unanimous
recommendation of the CPA:18 Special Committee, and W. P. Carey’s Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the CPA:18 Special
Committee during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the CPA:18 Special Committee, nor did
Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration to be received by CPA:18 - Global’s stockholders constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the Merger.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the CPA:18 Special Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the CPA:18
Special Committee in deciding to recommend to CPA:18 - Global’s Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the recommendation
of the CPA:18 Special Committee, with respect to the consideration to be received by CPA:18 - Global’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or of whether the CPA:18 Special Committee would have been willing to agree to a different form or amount of consideration.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with
Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, express an opinion or a recommendation as to how any stockholder of CPA:18 -
Global should act or vote in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not
address any other aspect of the Merger, including the prices at which shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will trade following consummation of
the Merger or at any time.
Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management
businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and
derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its
affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance
positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity
securities or loans of W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any
related derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the CPA:18 Special Committee with financial advisory services and a financial
opinion, and CPA:18 - Global has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an aggregate fee of $6,000,000, of which $1,500,000 was payable upon CPA:18 -
Global entering into a definitive agreement with respect to the Merger and $4,500,000 is payable upon the closing of the Merger. In addition, the
engagement letter provides for an additional fee of up to $4,000,000 payable in the sole discretion of the CPA:18 Special Committee based on
performance. CPA:18 - Global has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other
professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, CPA:18 - Global has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its
affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates
against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, relating to or arising out of Morgan
Stanley’s engagement.
In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not provided financial advisory or financing services for
CPA:18 - Global or W. P. Carey for which it received any fees. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may seek to provide financial advisory and financing
services to CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these
services.

W. P. Carey does not as a matter of course make public long-term projections as to future revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other
reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. Certain unaudited prospective financial information for both W. P. Carey and
CPA:18 - Global was provided to W. P. Carey's board of directors and CPA:18 - Global's Special Committee in connection with the evaluation of the
Merger. This unaudited prospective financial information also was provided to the financial advisors to W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global's Special
Committee. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global, their respective
financial advisors or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future results.
Neither W. P. Carey nor CPA:18 - Global can give any assurance that their forecasted results will be achieved.
The unaudited prospective financial information was, in general, prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects. As a result,
there can be no assurance that the prospective results will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than estimated.
Since the unaudited prospective financial results cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive
year.

W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics using different methodologies. Consequently, the financial metrics
presented in each company's prospective financial information disclosures may not be directly comparable to one another. For purposes of the
unaudited prospective financial information presented herein, NOI is calculated as contractual rental revenues and other real estate-related income,
less associated property expenses and reserves on a pro rata basis. Additionally, CPA:18 - Global has historically reported modified funds from
operation, referred to herein as Adjusted MFFO, as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure. W. P. Carey modifies the NAREIT
computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income in order to adjust for certain non-cash charges such as amortization of real
estate-related intangibles, deferred income tax benefits and expenses, straight-line rent and related reserves, other non-cash rent adjustments, non-
cash allowance for credit losses on loans receivable and direct financing leases, stock-based compensation, non-cash environmental accretion
expense, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt, and amortization of deferred financing costs. Additionally, W. P. Carey excludes non-core
income and expenses such as gains or losses from extinguishment of debt, and merger and acquisition expenses. W. P. Carey also excludes realized
and unrealized gains/losses on foreign exchange transactions (other than those realized on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives), which
are not considered fundamental attributes of its business plan and do not affect its overall long-term operating performance. W. P. Carey refers to its
modified definition of FFO as AFFO and employs AFFO as one measure of its operating performance when it formulates corporate goals and
evaluates the effectiveness of its strategies. CPA:18 - Global modifies the NAREIT computation of FFO in accordance with the guidelines and
definition of MFFO of the IPA, an industry trade group. In calculating MFFO, CPA:18 - Global excludes acquisition-related expenses, amortization
of above- and below-market leases, fair value adjustments or derivative financial
53
Table of Contents
instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. CPA:18 - Global refers to its modified
definition of FFO as MFFO and further adjusts MFFO for deferred income tax expenses and benefits, which are non-cash items that may cause
short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on current period cash flows and for realized gains/losses on the settlement of foreign
currency derivatives as they are a fundamental part of our operations in that they help us manage the foreign currency exposure we have
associated with cash flows from our international investments. CPA:18 - Global employs MFFO, adjusted as one measure of its operating
performance when it formulates corporate goals and evaluates the effectiveness of its strategies. Each of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global excludes
these items from GAAP net income as they are not the primary drivers in its decision-making process. Each of W. P. Carey's and CPA:18 - Global's
assessment of its respective operations is focused on long-term sustainability and not on such non-cash items, which may cause short-term
fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows. As a result, W. P. Carey believes that AFFO, and CPA:18 - Global believes Adjusted
MFFO, is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better understand and measure the performance of
W. P. Carey's and CPA:18 - Global's respective business over time without the potentially distorting impact of these short-term fluctuations.
In preparing the foregoing unaudited projected financial information, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global made a number of assumptions regarding,
among other things, interest rates, corporate financing activities, annual dividend levels, occupancy and customer retention levels, changes in rent,
the amount, timing and cost of existing and planned development properties, lease-up rates of existing and planned developments, the amount and
timing of asset sales and asset acquisitions, including the return on those acquisitions, the amount of income taxes paid, and the amount of general
and administrative costs. W. P. Carey also determined that the Merger does not meet the significance thresholds as defined by Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X.
The assumptions made in preparing the above unaudited prospective financial information may not accurately reflect future conditions. The
estimates and assumptions underlying the unaudited prospective financial information involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are
inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among others, risks
and uncertainties described under ""Risk Factors"" beginning on page 25 and ""Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements""
beginning on page 32, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global and will be
beyond the control of the combined company. The projected results and underlying assumptions may not be realized and actual results likely will
differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in the unaudited prospective financial information, whether or not the Merger is completed.
The prospective financial information included herein has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, the management of W. P. Carey and CPA:18
- Global. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered accounting firm of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global, has not audited, reviewed,

CORPORATE PROPERTY ASSOCIATES 18 GLOBAL INC_20220427_DEFM14A_20041574_4449712.Pdf,POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,"POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
A number of conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationship between W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global. In considering the recommendation of
the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global to approve the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders should be aware that potential conflicts of interest exist
because W. P. Carey and its affiliates serve as the advisor for CPA:18 - Global, the companies share common management, and the officers and
directors of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may have certain interests in the proposed transactions that are different from or in addition to the
interests of CPA:18 Stockholders generally. The board of directors of CPA:18 - Global recognized these conflicts and additional interests and the
need to independently determine that the Merger is in the best interests of CPA:18- Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders. Therefore, the board of
directors of CPA:18 - Global formed a special committee comprised entirely of independent directors, and the CPA:18 Special Committee engaged its
own independent legal and financial advisors. Certain of these potential conflicts and interests are highlighted below.
Advisory Relationship and Common Management
W. P. Carey's subsidiary, CAM, and its affiliates serve as the external advisor for CPA:18 - Global. Additionally, the executive management of CPA:18
- Global is comprised of the same individuals as the executive management of W. P. Carey. W. P. Carey, in its role as advisor to CPA:18 - Global,
performed an initial review of potential liquidity alternatives for CPA:18 - Global. In addition, the CPA:18 Special Committee's financial advisor relied,
in part, on financial information and property information provided by W. P. Carey in conducting their respective analyses.
To help alleviate potential conflicts, the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global created the CPA:18 Special Committee. The CPA:18 Special Committee
was delegated the sole authority to negotiate the terms of a transaction and to make a recommendation to the full board of directors, which could
include a recommendation to reject any transaction. The CPA:18 Special Committee was authorized to retain its own legal and financial advisors.
The CPA:18 - Global board of directors appointed all of its independent directors to the CPA:18 Special Committee.
Fees Payable by CPA:18 - Global to Its Advisor and Other Affiliates of W. P. Carey in Connection with the Merger
Conditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, W. P. Carey has waived all rights to receive any and all
Advisor Closing Amounts. In addition, W. P. Carey will receive no disposition fees in respect of the consummation of the Merger.
W. P. Carey and its affiliates will continue to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements and
the CPA:18 LP Agreement prior to the closing of the Merger. At December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey had accrued and unpaid fees of approximately $1.1
million pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey earned approximately $12.5
million in asset management fees and $7.3 million in Special General Partner distributions from CPA:18 - Global.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction, W. P. Carey may be entitled to receive a
termination fee and the Advisor Closing Amounts, subject to a credit of the lesser of the termination fee paid and the Special GP Amount. See the
section titled ""The Merger Agreement"" beginning on page 97.
Ownership of CPA:18 - Global Shares
As of April 27, 2022 (the ""CPA:18 Record Date""), W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries, and its directors and executive officers, owned 8,556,733 shares
of CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate (equal to approximately 5.7% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock). As of the CPA:18
Record Date, the directors of CPA:18 - Global beneficially owned 76,223 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate, representing less than
1.0% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and
any of their affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between
CPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its
56
Table of Contents
advisor; and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock necessary to approve the
Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the
matter and will not be included in making such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global
director, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the
requisite approval. Each share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger will automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.
Combined Company Board of Directors
The directors and officers of W. P. Carey immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will continue to be the directors and officers of W. P.
Carey after the Merger. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the directors of W. P. Carey as a group received cash and equity
compensation of $2.5 million. For additional information regarding the directors and executive officers of W. P. Carey following the Merger, please
refer to W. P. Carey's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A for its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on March 28, 2022,
which is incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.
Joint Ventures and Other Transactions with Affiliates
W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global and Carey European Student Housing Fund I, L.P. (“CESH”) share leased office space used for the administration of
their operations. Rental and occupancy related costs are allocated among the parties and their affiliates based on their respective advisory

requires otherwise, the terms ""we,"" ""us"" or ""our"" refer to CPA:18 - Global and its consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors.
General Development of Business
Corporate Property Associates 18 - Global Incorporated (“CPA:18 - Global”) and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, we, us, or our, is a
publicly owned, non-traded REIT that invests in a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial properties net-leased to companies, both
domestically and outside the United States. In addition, our portfolio includes operating self-storage and student housing investments. As a REIT,
we are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to the portion of our income that is distributed annually to our stockholders as long
as we satisfy certain requirements, principally relating to the nature of our income and the level of our distributions, among other factors. We
conduct substantially all of our investment activities and own all of our assets through CPA:18 Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership,
which is our Operating Partnership. In addition to being a general partner and a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, we also own a 99.97%
capital interest in the Operating Partnership. WPC-CPA:18 Holdings, LLC (“CPA:18 Holdings” or the “Special General Partner”), a subsidiary of
our sponsor, W. P. Carey Inc. (“W. P. Carey”), holds the remaining 0.03% special general partner interest in the Operating Partnership.
Narrative Description of Business
Business Objectives and Strategy
Our primary business objectives are to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, seek investments with potential for capital
appreciation, use leverage to enhance returns on our investments, and generate sufficient cash flow over time to provide investors with increasing
distributions. Our business operates in three reportable business segments: Net Lease, Self Storage, and Other Operating Properties.
Our investment strategy primarily focuses on owning and managing a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate that is net-leased to credit-worthy
companies. Net-leased properties generally require the tenant to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the
property (such as real estate taxes, insurance, and facility maintenance), and compared to other types of real estate investments, typically produce a
more predictable income stream and require minimal capital expenditures, which in turn generate revenues that provide our stockholders with a
stable, growing source of income. We also invest in self-storage facilities, which generate revenue from rents received from customers who rent
storage space, primarily under month-to-month leases for personal or business use, as well as student housing investments, which generate
revenue from leases of one year or less with individual students.
On December 20, 2019, we executed a framework agreement with a third party to enter into 11 net lease agreements for our student housing
properties located in Spain and Portugal for 25 years upon completion of construction (collectively, our “Iberian student housing portfolio” or
“Iberian student housing projects”). As of December 31, 2021, we have placed into service nine student housing properties, and the remaining two
student housing projects under construction will become subject to net lease agreements upon their completion and are scheduled to do so in 2022
and 2023. Under the terms of the framework agreement, the third-party lessee of the portfolio has the right to purchase the portfolio at pre-
determined prices if CPA:18 - Global engages in certain transactions, including the Merger. The third-party lessee has exercised its option to
purchase the Iberian student housing portfolio.
We are managed by W. P. Carey through certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, our “advisor”). W. P. Carey is a diversified REIT and leading owner
of commercial real estate listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WPC.” In addition, W. P. Carey also manages the CESH
portfolio. Pursuant to an advisory agreement, our advisor provides both strategic and day-to-day management services for us, including asset
management, dispositions of assets, investor relations, investment research and analysis, investment financing and other investment-related
services, and administrative services. Our advisor also provides office space and other facilities
59
Table of Contents
for us. We pay asset management fees and certain transactional fees to our advisor and also reimburse our advisor for certain expenses incurred in
providing services to us, including expenses associated with personnel provided for administration of our operations. As of December 31, 2021, the
current advisory agreement has been renewed through March 31, 2022. Our advisor also serves in this capacity with CESH, a limited partnership
formed for the purpose of developing, owning, and operating student housing properties in Europe.
We were formed as a Maryland corporation on September 7, 2012. We commenced our initial public offering in May 2013 and raised aggregate gross
proceeds of $1.2 billion through the closing of the offering in April 2015, which have been fully invested. In addition, from inception through
December 31, 2021, $220.4 million and $63.7 million of distributions to our stockholders were reinvested in our Class A and Class C common stock,
respectively, through our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”).
Our estimated net asset values per share (“NAVs”) as of September 30, 2021 were $9.07 per share for both Class A and Class C common stock.
We have no employees. As of December 31, 2021, our advisor had 183 employees available to perform services under our advisory agreement.
Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, our net lease portfolio was comprised of full or partial ownership interests in 53 properties, substantially all of which were
fully occupied and triple-net leased to 50 tenants, and totaled approximately 10.4 million square feet. The remainder of our portfolio was comprised
of full or partial ownership interests in 65 self-storage properties, three student housing development projects, and one student housing operating
property, totaling 5.1 million square feet.
Asset Management
Our advisor is generally responsible for all aspects of our operations, including selecting our investments, formulating and evaluating the terms of
each proposed acquisition, arranging for the acquisition of the investment, negotiating the terms of borrowings, managing our day-to-day
operations, and arranging for and negotiating sales of assets. With respect to our net-leased investments, asset management functions include
entering into new or modified transactions to meet the evolving needs of current tenants, re-leasing properties, credit and real estate risk analysis,
building expansions and redevelopments, refinancing debt, and strategic dispositions. With respect to our self-storage and student housing
investments, asset management functions include engaging unaffiliated third parties for management and operation of our investments, active
oversight of property developers and managers, credit and real estate risk analysis, building expansions and redevelopments, refinancing debt, and
selling assets. Working with the third-party managers it engages, our advisor reviews and approves operating and capital budgets, inspects
properties, and provides input on business strategy at the property.
Our advisor monitors compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of any of our
real estate investments on an ongoing basis, which typically involves ensuring that each tenant has paid real estate taxes and other expenses
relating to the properties it occupies and is maintaining appropriate insurance coverage. To ensure such compliance at our properties, our advisor
also utilizes third-party asset managers for certain domestic and international investments. Our advisor also reviews financial statements of our
tenants and undertakes physical inspections of the condition and maintenance. Additionally, our advisor periodically analyzes each tenant’s
financial condition, the industry in which each tenant operates, and each tenant’s relative strength in its industry. We believe our advisor’s in-
depth understanding of our tenants’ businesses and direct relationships with their management teams provides strong visibility into potential
issues. Our advisor’s business intelligence platform provides real-time information, allowing asset managers to work with tenants to enforce lease
provisions, and where appropriate, consider lease modifications.
Holding Period
We generally intend to hold our investments in real property for an extended period depending on the type of investment. The determination of
whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made
60
Table of Contents
after consideration of relevant factors (including prevailing economic conditions), with a view to achieving maximum capital appreciation for our
stockholders or avoiding increases in risk. No assurance can be given that these objectives will be realized.
One of our objectives is ultimately to provide our stockholders with the opportunity to obtain liquidity for their investments in us. We may provide
liquidity for our stockholders through sales of assets (either on a portfolio basis or individually), a listing of our shares on a stock exchange, a
merger (which may include a merger with W. P. Carey or its affiliates) an enhanced redemption program or another transaction approved by our
board of directors. We are under no obligation to liquidate our portfolio within any particular period since the precise timing will depend on real
estate and financial markets, economic conditions of the areas in which the properties are located, and tax effects on stockholders that may prevail
in the future. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate a liquidity event. In the most recent instance in which
stockholders of a non-traded REIT managed by our advisor were provided with liquidity, Corporate Property Associates 17 - Global Incorporated
merged with and into a subsidiary of W. P. Carey on October 31, 2018.
On August 31, 2021, we reported that our independent directors intended to begin the process of evaluating possible liquidity alternatives for our
stockholders, which included an unsolicited preliminary proposal for a potential business combination transaction received from affiliates of our
advisor. The independent directors have formed a special committee and retained advisors. There can be no assurance as to the form or timing of
any liquidity alternative or that any alternative may be pursued at all for the foreseeable future. We do not intend to discuss the evaluation process
unless and until a particular alternative is selected.
Financing Strategies
Consistent with our investment policies, we use leverage when available on terms we believe are favorable. We will generally borrow in the same
currency that is used to pay rent on the property. This enables us to hedge a significant portion of our currency risk on international investments.
We, through the subsidiaries we form to make investments, will generally seek to borrow on a non-recourse basis and in amounts that we believe
will maximize the return to our stockholders, although we may also borrow at the corporate level. The use of non-recourse financing may allow us to
improve returns to our stockholders and to limit our exposure on any investment to the amount invested.
Aggregate borrowings on our portfolio as a whole may not exceed, on average, the lesser of 75% of the total costs of all investments or 300% of
our net assets, unless the excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report,
along with justification for the excess.
Our charter currently provides that we will not borrow funds from our directors, W. P. Carey, our advisor or any of their respective affiliates unless
the transaction is approved by a majority of our directors (including a majority of the independent directors) who do not have an interest in the
transaction, as being fair, competitive, and commercially reasonable and not less favorable than those prevailing for loans between unaffiliated third
parties under the same circumstances. We have a $50.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit agreement with W. P. Carey, which was approved
by our directors. Under this line of credit, we may borrow at a rate equal to the rate that W. P. Carey can borrow funds under its senior credit facility,
with a scheduled maturity date of March 31, 2023.
Investment Strategies
Long-Term, Net-Leased Assets
In analyzing potential net-lease investments for our real estate portfolio, our advisor reviews various aspects of a transaction, including the tenant
and the underlying real estate fundamentals, to determine whether the potential investment and lease structure will satisfy our investment criteria.
In evaluating net-leased transactions, our advisor generally considers, among other things, the following aspects of each transaction:
Tenant/Borrower Evaluation - Our advisor evaluates each potential tenant or borrower for its creditworthiness, typically considering factors such
as management experience, industry position and fundamentals,
61
Table of Contents
operating history, and capital structure. Our advisor also rates each asset based on its market, liquidity, and criticality to the tenant’s operations, as
well as other factors that may be unique to a particular investment. Our advisor seeks opportunities in which it believes the tenant may have a
stable or improving credit profile or credit potential that has not been fully recognized by the market. Our advisor defines creditworthiness as a risk-
reward relationship appropriate to its investment strategies, which may or may not coincide with ratings issued by the credit rating agencies. Our
advisor has a robust internal credit rating system and may designate subsidiaries of non-guarantor parent companies with investment grade ratings
as “implied investment grade.” As of December 31, 2021, we had eight and five tenants that were rated investment grade and implied investment
grade, respectively, as well as 37 below-investment grade tenants (with a weighted-average internal credit rating of 3.7). The aforementioned credit
rating data does not include our student housing operating properties and development projects.
Lease Terms - Generally, the net-leased properties we invest in are leased on a full-recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, the
vast majority of our leases provide for scheduled rent increases over the term of the lease. These increases are either fixed (i.e., mandated on
specific dates) or tied to increases in inflation indices (e.g., Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), or similar indices in the jurisdiction where the property is
located), but may contain caps or other limitations, either on an annual or overall basis. In the case of retail stores, hotels, and net leased student
housing properties (when the student housing property is completed and occupied subsequent to the beginning of an academic school year) the
lease may initially provide for participation in gross revenues of the tenant above a stated level (“percentage rent”) as opposed to a fixed rent.
Transaction Provisions to Enhance and Protect Value - When negotiating leases with potential tenants, our Advisor attempts to include
provisions it believes may help to protect our investment from changes in the tenant’s operating and financial characteristics, which may affect the
tenant’s ability to satisfy its obligations to us or reduce the value of our investment. Such provisions include covenants requiring our consent for
certain activities, requiring indemnification protections and/or security deposits, and requiring the tenant to satisfy specific operating tests. We
may also seek to enhance the likelihood that a tenant will satisfy their lease obligations through a letter of credit or guaranty from the tenant’s
parent or other entity. Such credit enhancements, if obtained, provide us with additional financial security. However, in markets where competition
for net-lease transactions is strong, some or all of these lease provisions may be difficult to obtain.
Competition - We face active competition from many sources, both domestically and internationally, for net-lease investment opportunities in
commercial properties. In general, we believe that our advisor’s experience in real estate, credit underwriting, and transaction structuring will allow
us to compete effectively for commercial properties. However, competitors may be willing to accept rates of return, lease terms, other transaction
terms, or levels of risk that we find unacceptable.
Operating Properties and Other
Self-Storage Investments - Our advisor combines a rigorous underwriting process and active oversight of property managers with a goal to
generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our self-storage investments are managed by unaffiliated third parties who have been engaged by our
advisor. Our advisor’s internal asset management personnel oversee the third-party managers with detailed performance reviews, budget review
and approval, and business strategy review.
Student Housing Investments - We have strategic relationships with third parties for the purpose of sourcing and managing investment
opportunities in this sector, both domestically and internationally. We combine a rigorous underwriting process and active oversight of property
developers and managers with a goal to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Diversification
Our advisor attempts to diversify our portfolio to avoid undue dependence on any one particular tenant, borrower, collateral type, geographic
location, or industry. By diversifying the portfolio, our advisor seeks to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a
downturn in any particular industry or geographic region. While our advisor has no fixed diversity metrics in our portfolio, we believe that it is well-
diversified. Our Advisor also assesses the relative risk of our portfolio on a quarterly basis.
62
Table of Contents
Real Estate Evaluation - Our advisor reviews and evaluates the physical condition of the property and the market in which it is located. Our
advisor considers a variety of factors, including current market rents, replacement cost, residual valuation, property operating history, demographic
characteristics of the location and accessibility, competitive properties, and suitability for re-leasing. Our advisor obtains third-party environmental
and engineering reports and market studies for us when required. When considering an investment outside the United States, our advisor will also
consider factors particular to a country or region, including geopolitical risk, in addition to the risks normally associated with real property
investments.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we issued 342,766 shares of our Class A common stock to our Advisor as consideration for
asset management fees, which were issued at our most recently published NAV at the date of issuance. The shares issued in October and
November 2021 (231,986 shares) were based on the NAV as of June 30, 2021 ($8.91), and the shares issued in December 2021 (110,780 shares) were
based on the NAV as of September 30, 2021 ($9.07). In acquiring our shares, our advisor represented that such interests were being acquired by it
for investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof. As previously discussed in our filings with the SEC, over the past three
years, we have issued 27,792 shares of our common stock to our directors from time to time. Since none of these transactions were considered to
have involved a “public offering” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, the shares issued were deemed to be exempt
from registration.
All other prior sales of unregistered securities have been reported in our previously filed quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K,
respectively.

the request of our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions, conditions, and limitations. The maximum amount of shares purchasable by us in any period depends on a
number of factors and is at the discretion of our board of directors. On August 31, 2020, our board of directors approved, effective as of that date, limiting the amount of
cash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP (as further detailed in the Form
8-K filed with the SEC on September 1, 2020). During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we received 90 and 26 redemption requests for Class A and Class C
common stock, respectively, which were all fulfilled as of the date of this Report. We also redeemed 1,746,379 and 976,102 shares of Class A and Class C common stock
that had previously been unfulfilled. We generally receive fees in connection with share redemptions. The average price paid per share will vary depending on the number
of redemption requests that were made during the period, the number of redemption requests that qualify for special circumstances, and the most recently published
quarterly NAV. For shares redeemed under such special circumstances, the redemption price was the greater of the price paid to acquire the shares from us or 95% of our
most recently published quarterly NAVs.

Significant Developments
COVID-19
Our advisor continues to actively engage in discussions with our tenants and the third-party managers of our operating properties regarding the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business operations, liquidity, and financial position. Through the date of this Report, we received from
tenants approximately 96% of contractual base rent that was due in the fourth quarter of 2021 (based on contractual minimum ABR as of September
30, 2021) and 96% of contractual rents due at our self-storage properties during the fourth quarter of 2021. Given the ongoing uncertainty
surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict its effect on our tenants’ continued ability to pay rent. Therefore,
information provided in this Report regarding rent collections should not serve as an indication of expected future rent collections.
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2021, our debt and interest obligations due within one year totaled $264.7 million, and we expect to fund capital commitments of
$48.5 million in the next year, primarily for our three student housing development projects. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our
liquidity and capital resource requirements, primarily through available cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, and
undrawn capacity under our construction loans. If necessary, we are able to borrow up to $50.0 million under an unsecured revolving line of credit
with W. P. Carey (scheduled to mature on March 31, 2023), which had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2021. Subsequent to December 31,
2021 and through the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we borrowed $18.0 million under the line of credit. Additional sources of liquidity, if
necessary, includes leveraging our unleveraged properties (which had an aggregate carrying value of $79.9 million as of December 31, 2021),
refinancing existing debt obligations, and asset sales. To help us preserve cash, since April 1, 2020, our advisor has agreed to receive all asset
management fees in shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, in order to enable us to retain cash and preserve financial flexibility, (i) since
the second quarter of 2020, our quarterly distributions declared for both Class A and Class C common stock have generally been reduced from
previous levels and (ii) since August 2020, we have generally limited the amount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount
reinvested by stockholders in our DRIP.
In December 2021, we declared and paid an all-cash special distribution of $0.2000 per share for both Class A and Class C common stock, with
proceeds from the disposition of certain assets. In December 2021, we also
66
Table of Contents
fulfilled redemption requests for our Class A and Class C common stock totaling approximately $18.5 million and $9.0 million, respectively, including
all requests that were previously unfulfilled.
Net Asset Values
Our advisor calculates our NAVs as of each quarter-end by relying in part on rolling update appraisals covering approximately 25% of our real
estate portfolio each quarter, adjusted to give effect to the estimated fair value of our debt (all provided by an independent third party) and for other
relevant factors. Since our quarterly NAVs are not based on an appraisal of our full portfolio, to the extent any new quarterly NAV adjustments are
within 1% of our previously disclosed NAVs, our quarterly NAVs will remain unchanged. We monitor properties not appraised during the quarter to
identify any that may have experienced a significant event and obtain updated third-party appraisals for such properties. Our NAVs are based on a
number of variables, including individual tenant credits, lease terms, lending credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates, share counts, tenant
defaults, and development projects that are not yet generating income, among others. We do not control all of these variables and, as such, cannot
predict how they will change in the future. Costs associated with our development projects (which are not yet generating income) are not appraised
quarterly and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. These costs are included in Real estate under construction in our consolidated
financial statements. Our NAVs as of September 30, 2021 were $9.07 for both our Class A and Class C common stock. Please see our Current Report
on Form 8-K dated December 9, 2021 for additional information regarding the calculation of our NAVs.
Financial Highlights
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the following (as further described in the consolidated financial statements).
Projects Placed into Service
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed and placed into service four student housing properties totaling $171.2 million of
capitalized costs. Three of the properties are located in Spain and one is located in Portugal. All four of the properties are subject to net lease
agreements with a third party (which includes fixed minimum rents), and are included in Real estate - Land, buildings and improvements in the
consolidated balance sheets.
Disposition Activity
On September 3, 2021, we sold two student housing operating properties located in Cardiff and Portsmouth, United Kingdom, for total proceeds,
net of selling costs, of $147.8 million (based on the exchange rate of the British pound sterling on the date of disposition), and recognized a net gain
on these sales totaling $42.8 million (inclusive of $3.7 million attributable to a noncontrolling interest). In connection with this disposition, we
prepaid a non-recourse mortgage loan of $83.3 million, with an interest rate of 2.3%, encumbering the disposed properties.
On October 29, 2021, we sold a retail facility in Zadar, Croatia, for total proceeds, net of selling costs, of $14.4 million (based on the exchange rate of
the euro on the date of the disposition), and recognized a net gain on this sale of $2.0 million (inclusive of $0.4 million attributable to a
noncontrolling interest). In connection with this disposition, we prepaid a non-recourse mortgage loan of $8.3 million, with an interest rate of 3.9%,
encumbering the property.
On December 29, 2021, we sold a vacant industrial facility located in Columbus, Georgia, for total proceeds, net of selling costs, of $0.5 million, and
recognized a net loss on this sale of $0.8 million. In connection with this disposition, we prepaid a non-recourse mortgage loan of $6.8 million, with
an interest rate of 5.0%, encumbering the property.
Financing Activity
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we obtained non-recourse mortgage loans and construction loans in connection with five student
housing properties totaling approximately $153.7 million, with drawdowns totaling
67
Table of Contents
approximately $123.6 million during the year (amounts are based on the applicable exchange rates on the date of the transactions).
Mortgage Loan Repayments
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid four non-recourse mortgage loans at maturity with an aggregate principal balance of
approximately $56.3 million and a weighted-average interest rate of 4.2%.

(a)Quarterly distributions declared are generally paid in the subsequent quarter. Since the second quarter of 2020, our distributions declared for both Class A and Class C
common stock were reduced from previous levels to enable us to retain cash and preserve financial flexibility.
(b)In December 2021, we declared and paid an all-cash special distribution of $0.2000 per share for both Class A and Class C stock with proceeds from certain asset
dispositions.
(c)We consider the performance metrics listed above, including FFO, Modified funds from operations (“MFFO”), and Adjusted modified funds from operations (“Adjusted
MFFO”), which are supplemental measures that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (“non-GAAP measures”), to be important
measures in the evaluation of our operating performance. See Supplemental Financial Measures below for our definitions of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations
to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Revenues
Total revenues increased during 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher revenues from self-storage operating properties (driven by an
increase in occupancy and unit rates) and the positive impact of our student housing properties placed into service during 2020 and 2021, as well as
the write-off of straight-line rent during 2020.
Net Income Attributable to CPA:18 - Global
Net income attributable to CPA:18 - Global increased during 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to a higher gain on sale of real estate, higher
revenues from self-storage operating properties, the positive impact of the nine student housing properties placed into service during 2020 and
2021, and the write-off of straight-line rent recorded during 2020, partially offset by an impairment charge recognized during 2021 and higher interest
expense (primarily due to the impact of mortgage financings obtained on certain student housing properties placed into service during 2020 and
2021).

Lease Composition and Leasing Activities
Substantially all of our leases provide for either scheduled rent increases, periodic rent adjustments based on formulas indexed to changes in the
CPI or similar indices, or percentage rents. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 44.2% of our leases (based on ABR) provided for adjustments
based on formulas indexed to changes in the U.S. CPI (or similar indices for the jurisdiction in which the property is located), some of which are
subject to caps and/or floors. In addition, 42.3% of our leases (based on ABR) have fixed rent adjustments, for a scheduled average ABR increase
of 1.8% over the next 12 months. Lease revenues from our international investments are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily from the
euro. We recognize rents from percentage rents as reported by the lessees, which is after the level of sales requiring a rental payment to us is
reached. Percentage rents are insignificant for the periods presented.
In September 2021, we restructured the leases with a tenant for two net lease hotel properties located in Germany, with ABR totaling approximately
$6.0 million as of December 31, 2021. Certain rents due from 2020 through 2022 have been deferred, to be paid in equal installments of approximately
$2.0 million annually (based on the exchange rate of the euro as of December 31, 2021) from 2023 through 2027, in addition to base rent due.
Deferred rent will be recognized as collected in the period received. Rents due from 2020 through 2021 totaling approximately $5.4 million (based on
the exchange rate of the euro as of December 31, 2021) were waived in connection with this restructuring. However, such rents were not previously
recognized, therefore there is no impact on our results of operations as a result of waiving rents.

Table of Contents
Terms and Definitions
Pro Rata Metrics - The portfolio information above contains certain metrics prepared on a pro rata basis (“Pro Rata Metrics”). We have a number
of investments in which our economic ownership is less than 100%. On a full consolidation basis, we report 100% of the assets, liabilities, revenues,
and expenses of those investments that are deemed to be under our control or for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, even if our
ownership is less than 100%. Also, for all other jointly owned investments, which we do not control, we report our net investment and our net
income (loss) from that investment. On a pro rata basis, we generally present our proportionate share, based on our economic ownership of these
jointly owned investments, of the portfolio metrics of those investments. Multiplying each of our jointly owned investments’ financial statement
line items by our percentage ownership and adding or subtracting those amounts from our totals, as applicable, may not accurately depict the legal
and economic implications of holding an ownership interest of less than 100% in our jointly owned investments.
ABR - ABR represents contractual minimum annualized base rent for our net-leased properties and reflects exchange rates as of December 31, 2021.
If there is a rent abatement, we annualize the first monthly contractual base rent following the free rent period. ABR is not applicable to operating
properties.
NOI - Net operating income (“NOI”) is a non-GAAP measure intended to reflect the performance of our entire portfolio of properties and
investments. We define NOI as lease revenues and other operating interest income less non-reimbursable property and corporate expenses as
determined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is a helpful measure that both investors and management can use to evaluate the financial performance
of our properties and it allows for comparison of our portfolio performance between periods and to other REITs. While we believe that NOI is a
useful supplemental measure, it should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indication of our operating performance.
Stabilized NOI - We use Stabilized NOI, a non-GAAP measure, as a metric to evaluate the performance of our entire portfolio of properties.
Stabilized NOI for development projects and newly acquired operating properties that are not yet substantially leased up are not included in our
portfolio information until one year after the project has been substantially completed and placed into service, or the property has been
substantially leased up (and the project or property has not been disposed of during or prior to the current period). In addition, any newly acquired
stabilized operating property is included in our portfolio of Stabilized NOI information upon acquisition. Stabilized NOI for a net-leased property is
included in our portfolio information upon acquisition or in the period when it is placed into service (as the property will already have a lease in
place).
Stabilized NOI is adjusted for corporate expenses, such as asset management fees and the available cash generated by the Operating Partnership
(the ""Available Cash Distribution”) to our advisor, that are calculated and reported at the corporate level and not evaluated as part of any
property’s operating performance. Additionally, non-cash adjustments (such as straight-line rent adjustments) and interest income related to our
notes receivable (which is non-property related) are not included in Stabilized NOI. Lastly, non-core income is excluded from Stabilized NOI as this
income is generally not recurring in nature.
We believe that Stabilized NOI is a helpful measure that both investors and management can use to evaluate the financial performance of our
properties and it allows for comparison of our portfolio performance between periods and to other REITs. While we believe that Stabilized NOI is a
useful supplemental measure, it should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) as an indication of our operating performance.

Results of Operations
We evaluate our results of operations with a focus on: (i) our ability to generate the cash flow necessary to meet our objectives of funding
distributions to stockholders and (ii) increasing the value of our real estate investments. As a result, our assessment of operating results gives less
emphasis to the effect of unrealized gains and losses, which may cause fluctuations in net income (loss) for comparable periods but have no impact
on cash flows, and to other non-cash charges, such as depreciation and impairment charges.

Lease Revenues
“Existing net-leased properties” are those we acquired or placed into service prior to January 1, 2020 and were not sold during the periods
presented. For the periods presented, there were 44 existing net-leased properties.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, lease revenues from existing net-leased properties increased by $12.0 million, primarily
due to (i) a $7.0 million write-off of straight-line rent in 2020; (ii) a $2.6 million increase as a result of the strengthening of the euro and Norwegian
krone in relation to the U.S. dollar; and (iii) a $2.2 million increase in reimbursable tenant costs largely due to higher property tax assessments at
certain properties, partially offset by $0.7 million of lower rent collected during 2021, as a result of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
(uncollected rent was $9.9 million during 2021, as compared to $9.2 million during 2020).
“Recently net-leased or acquired properties” are those we placed into service or acquired subsequent to December 31, 2019 or remain under
construction as a development project (and are subject to net leases upon completion of construction). For the periods presented, there were 11
recently net-leased or acquired properties, comprised of eight student housing properties, two ongoing student housing development projects, and
one property acquired in 2021.
“Net-leased properties sold or held for sale” includes two net lease properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2021 and one net lease
property sold during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Operating Property Revenues
“Existing operating properties” are those that we acquired or placed into service prior to January 1, 2020 and were not sold during the periods
presented. For the periods presented, there were 65 existing operating properties (all of which are self-storage operating properties).
For the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, operating property revenues from existing operating properties increased by $10.2
million, due to an increase in occupancy and unit rates across our self-storage portfolio.
“Recently opened operating properties” are student housing operating properties that were placed into service subsequent to December 31, 2019,
or remain under construction as a development project (and are not subject to net leases upon completion of construction). For the periods
presented, we had two recently opened student housing
78

operating properties, comprised of a student housing operating property placed into service during the third quarter of 2020 and an ongoing
student housing development project.
“Operating properties sold” includes the two student housing operating properties located in the United Kingdom sold during the year ended
December 31, 2021.
Interest Income and Other
Interest income and other primarily consists of interest income from our notes receivable investment and other non-recurring income.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, interest income and other decreased by $3.3 million, primarily due to (i) a $1.4 million
decrease in interest income recognition from our notes receivable as a result of the borrower default on the mortgage loan senior to our mezzanine
tranche of a mortgage-backed security; (ii) the collection of $1.1 million in lease-related settlements in 2020 as a result of a lease restructuring at one
of our properties in 2019; and (iii) $0.8 million in termination income recognized in 2020.

properties as a result of the four and five student housing properties placed into service during 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Impairment Charges
We periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate investments may be impaired or that their carrying value
may not be recoverable. .
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $23.5 million (inclusive of $11.8 million attributable to a
noncontrolling interest) on an international office facility in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value ($61.4 million), due to the
current tenant’s notice of non-renewal of its lease expiring in May 2023. The fair value measurement was determined by estimating discounted cash
flows using three significant unobservable inputs, which were the discount rate (7.00%), residual capitalization rate (range of 6.75% to 7.75%), and
estimated market rents (range of $17 to $18 per square foot). This impairment charge is included within Impairment charges and Net loss (income)
attributable to noncontrolling interests on our consolidated statements of income, and reduced Real estate - Land, buildings and improvements and
Noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets.
Allowance for Credit Losses
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net reversal of our allowance for credit losses of $2.9 million due to changes in expected
economic conditions relating to a net investment in direct financing lease.

Other Income and (Expenses), and Provision for Income Taxes
Interest Expense
Our interest expense is directly impacted by the non-recourse secured debt financings obtained, assumed, or extinguished in connection with our
investment, construction, and disposition activity.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, interest expense increased by $7.6 million, primarily as a result of the mortgage
financings obtained on certain student housing properties placed into service during 2021 and 2020.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net
Gain on sale of real estate, net, consists of gain on the sale of properties that were disposed of during the reporting period. Our dispositions are
more fully described in our notes to our audited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated
statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021.
Other Gains and (Losses)
Other gains and (losses) primarily consist of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and derivative instruments. We make intercompany
loans to a number of our foreign subsidiaries, most of which do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Remeasurement of foreign
currency intercompany transactions that are scheduled for settlement, consisting primarily of accrued interest and amortizing loans, are included in
the determination of net income. We also recognize gains or losses on foreign currency transactions held by entities with the U.S. dollar as their
functional currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The timing and amount of such gains or losses cannot always be estimated and
are subject to fluctuation.
2021 - For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net other losses of $2.7 million, which was primarily comprised of (i) net realized and
unrealized losses of $2.3 million related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and (ii) a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million;
(iii) a gain of $0.8 million relating to a rental guarantee settlement received; and (iii) a gain of $0.4 million relating to proceeds received from a prior
disposition.
2020 - For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net other gains of $1.9 million, which was primarily comprised of (i) $3.9 million of
realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains; (ii) $1.3 million of net realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts and collars;
and (iii) $0.3 million of interest income from our cash accounts, offset by $3.5 million of losses incurred in relation to our previously owned Ghana
investment.
Earnings (Losses) from Equity Method Investment in Real Estate
For the year ended December 31, 2020, earnings from our equity method investment in real estate totaled $12.3 million, primarily due to the sale of
three self-storage facilities located in Canada for total proceeds of $62.3 million, for which we recognized a gain on sale of $12.9 million (inclusive of
tax of $1.8 million).
Provision for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes is primarily related to our international properties.
80
Table of Contents
For the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, our net provision for income taxes increased by $1.1 million, primarily due to higher
current tax expense related to reviews of tax positions on certain international properties.
Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $0.2 million, compared to net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests of $10.0 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a noncontrolling
interest’s $11.8 million share of an impairment charge recognized on one of our properties during 2021, partially offset by $3.7 million related to the
net gain on sale of the two student housing operating properties disposed in 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash During the Year
We use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, fund construction projects, service debt, and fund
distributions to stockholders. Our cash flows will fluctuate periodically due to a number of factors, which may include, among other things: the
timing of funding for our build-to-suit and development projects; the timing of the receipt of proceeds from, and the repayment of, non-recourse
secured debt and the W. P. Carey line of credit, and the receipt of lease revenues; whether our Advisor receives fees in shares of our common stock
or cash, which our board of directors elects after consultation with our advisor; the timing of payments of the Available Cash Distributions to our
advisor; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Despite these fluctuations, we believe our investments will generate sufficient cash from
operations to meet our normal recurring short-term and long-term liquidity needs, as well as the measures noted above. We may also use existing
cash resources, the proceeds of non-recourse secured debt, sales of assets, and distributions reinvested in our common stock through our DRIP
(as noted below, our board of directors has limited the amount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested in our DRIP)
to meet these needs. We assess our ability to access capital on an ongoing basis. Our sources and uses of cash during the period are described
below.
Operating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.4 million during 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher
revenues from self-storage operating properties, driven by an increase in occupancy and unit rates, partially offset by higher interest expense.
Investing Activities - Our investing activities are generally comprised of funding of development projects and capitalized property-related costs. In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold (i) two student housing operating properties located in the United Kingdom for net
proceeds of $147.8 million; (ii) a retail facility in Zadar, Croatia, for net proceeds of $14.4 million; and (iii) a vacant industrial facility located in
Columbus, Georgia, for net proceeds of $0.5 million. We also acquired one net-leased property for $10.9 million during the year ended December 31,
2021.
Financing Activities - Our financing activities are generally comprised of borrowings, repayments and prepayments of our non-recourse secured
debt and line of credit with W. P. Carey, and activity relating to our common stock, which includes (i) payments of distributions to stockholders, (ii)
distributions that are reinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock through our DRIP, and (iii) repurchases of shares of our common
stock pursuant to our redemption program as described below. In addition, cash paid and received in accordance with our individual agreements
with our joint-venture partners are considered financing cash flow activities.
Distributions
Our objectives are to generate sufficient cash flow over time to provide stockholders with distributions. During 2021, we declared distributions to
stockholders of $68.2 million, which were comprised of cash distributions of $50.8 million (including an all-cash special distribution) and $17.4
million reinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have
declared distributions to stockholders totaling $598.9 million, which were comprised of cash distributions of $310.4 million and $288.5 million
reinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP.
81
Table of Contents
We believe that FFO, a non-GAAP measure, is an appropriate metric to evaluate our ability to fund distributions to stockholders. For a discussion
of FFO, see Supplemental Financial Measures below. Since inception, the regular quarterly cash distributions that we pay have principally been
covered by FFO or cash flow from operations. However, we funded a portion of our cash distributions to date using net proceeds from our initial
public offering and there can be no assurance that our FFO or cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover our future distributions. Our
distribution coverage using both FFO as well as our net cash provided by operating activities fully covered our total quarterly recurring
distributions declared for the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2021, we declared and paid an all-cash special distribution of $0.2000 per
share for both Class A and Class C stock with proceeds from the disposition of certain assets.
Redemptions
We maintain a quarterly redemption program pursuant to which we may, at the discretion of our board of directors, redeem shares of our common
stock from stockholders seeking liquidity. On August 31, 2020, our board of directors approved, effective as of that date, generally limiting the
amount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested by stockholders in our DRIP (as further detailed in the Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on September 1, 2020). We prioritized qualifying special circumstance redemption requests (i.e., death, disability, receipt of long-term
care), with shares pursuant to the remaining requests redeemed on a pro rata basis. In December 2021, we redeemed in full any shares covered by
unfulfilled redemption requests. Our board of directors retains the discretion to modify the program at any time.

Cash Resources
As of December 31, 2021, our cash resources consisted of the following:
•cash and cash equivalents totaling $52.1 million. Of this amount, $31.2 million (at then-current exchange rates) was held in foreign subsidiaries,
which may be subject to restrictions or significant costs should we decide to repatriate these funds;
•ability to borrow up to $50.0 million from the unsecured revolving line of credit with W. P. Carey (scheduled to mature on March 31, 2023), which
had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2021 and through the date of this Report, we borrowed $18.0
million under the line of credit;
•ability to borrow up to $32.0 million and $1.3 million under our third-party and external joint-venture financing arrangements, respectively; and
•unleveraged properties that had an aggregate carrying value of $79.9 million as of December 31, 2021, although there can be no assurance that we
would be able to obtain financing for these properties on acceptable terms.
Our cash resources may be used for funding construction costs, working capital needs, other commitments, and to make distributions to our
stockholders.

Cash Requirements and Liquidity
During the next 12 months following December 31, 2021 and thereafter, we expect that our significant cash requirements will include:
•paying distributions to our stockholders and to our affiliates that hold noncontrolling interests in entities we control;
•funding future capital commitments such as development projects;
•making scheduled principal and balloon payments on our debt obligations;
•making scheduled interest payments on our debt obligations (future interest payments total $120.9 million, with $44.4 million due during the next 12
months; interest on unhedged variable-rate debt obligations was calculated using the applicable annual variable interest rates); and
•making share repurchases pursuant to our redemption plan.
We use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, service debt, and fund distributions to
stockholders. We may also use proceeds from asset sales to fund development projects, build-to-suit investments, and short-term cash
requirements. We currently expect that, for the short-term, the aforementioned cash requirements will be funded through our cash resources (as
noted above), and our cash flow from operations, including the cash received under net lease and operating lease agreements. During 2020 and
2021, we placed into service nine student housing properties (eight of which executed net lease agreements). In addition, in order to preserve cash
and maintain financial flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic:
•at our option our advisor has received all asset management fees in shares of our Class A common stock since April 1, 2020;
•we have reduced our distributions declared for both Class A and Class C common stock since the second quarter of 2020;
•we limited the amount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested by stockholders in our DRIP, since August 2020; and
•we have refinanced certain loans and have the ability to refinance loans coming due.
Our liquidity could be adversely affected by unanticipated costs, greater-than-anticipated operating expenses, and the continuing adverse impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as tenants not paying rental obligations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our liquidity and
debt covenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.
Certain amounts disclosed above are based on the exchange rate of the local currencies as of December 31, 2021, which consisted primarily of the
euro and Norwegian krone and, to a lesser extent, the British pound sterling.
Environmental Obligations
In connection with the purchase of many of our properties, we required the sellers to perform environmental reviews. We believe, based on the
results of these reviews, that our properties were in substantial compliance with federal, state, and foreign environmental statutes at the time the
properties were acquired. However, portions of certain properties have been subject to some degree of contamination, principally in connection
with leakage from underground storage tanks, surface spills, or other on-site activities. In most instances where contamination has been identified,
tenants are actively engaged in the remediation process and addressing identified conditions. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any
environmental matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. We record
environmental obligations within Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Many of our significant accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical
experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are subject to change in the future if
underlying assumptions or factors change. Certain accounting policies, while significant, may not require the use of estimates. Those accounting
policies that require significant estimation and/or judgment are described under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our notes to our
audited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive
income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021.
Supplemental Financial Measures
In the real estate industry, analysts and investors employ certain non-GAAP supplemental financial measures in order to facilitate meaningful
comparisons between periods and among peer companies. Additionally, in the formulation of our goals and in the evaluation of the effectiveness of
our strategies, we use FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are useful to investors to
consider because they may assist them to better understand and measure the performance of our business over time and against similar companies.
A description of FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures are provided below.
FFO
Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”), an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate
supplemental measure, when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, to reflect the operating
performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental non-GAAP measure. FFO is not equivalent to, nor
a substitute for, net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors
of NAREIT, as restated in December 2018. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains
or losses from sales of property, impairment charges on real estate, and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets; and after adjustments
for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are
calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT’s policy described above. However, NAREIT’s definition of FFO does not
distinguish between the conventional method of equity accounting and the hypothetical liquidation at book value method of accounting for
unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments.
The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements. We believe that,
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment, and
consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical
accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be
construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe
that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization, as well as impairment charges of real estate-
related assets, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management; and when compared year over year,
reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest
costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is
a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions, which can change over
time.

Table of Contents
MFFO
Publicly registered, non-traded REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their
initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years,
we believe that non-traded REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after
acquisition activity ceases. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-traded REITs, the Institute for Portfolio
Alternatives (the “IPA”), an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental
measure for publicly registered non-traded REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate non-GAAP measure to reflect our operations.
MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating
performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy (as currently intended). Since MFFO excludes
costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO, we believe that it provides an
indication of the sustainability of our operating performance after our initial property-acquisition phase. We believe that MFFO allows investors
and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance now that our initial public offering is complete and the proceeds are
invested. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-traded REIT industry.
We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA’s Practice Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly
Registered, Non-Traded REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the “Practice Guideline”), issued in November 2010. The Practice Guideline
defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, included in the determination of GAAP net income, as applicable: acquisition fees
and expenses; amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order
to reflect such payments from a GAAP basis to a cash accrual basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and
amortization of premiums on debt investments; nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments (i.e., infrequent or unusual, not
reasonably likely to recur in the ordinary course of business); mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses
included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, foreign exchange, derivatives, or securities holdings where trading of such holdings
is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned
investments, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on
debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from
consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments, are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by
operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses that are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA’s Practice Guideline described above and is adjusted for certain items, such as accretion of discounts
and amortizations of premiums on borrowings (as such adjustments are comparable to the permitted adjustments for debt investments), allowance
for credit losses, non-cash accretion of environmental liabilities and amortization of ROU assets, which management believes is helpful in assessing
our operating performance.
Our management uses MFFO in order to evaluate our performance against other non-traded REITs, which also have limited lives with defined
acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating
performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. For example, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current
market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and
occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect
anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.

Table of Contents
Adjusted MFFO
In addition, our management uses Adjusted MFFO as another measure of sustainable operating performance. Adjusted MFFO adjusts MFFO for
deferred income tax expenses and benefits, which are non-cash items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income, but have no impact on
current period cash flows. Additionally, we adjust MFFO to reflect the realized gains/losses on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives to
arrive at Adjusted MFFO. Foreign currency derivatives are a fundamental part of our operations in that they help us manage the foreign currency
exposure we have associated with cash flows from our international investments.
FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO
Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different
REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs
may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and
should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an
indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance.
Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate
FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments
across the non-traded REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO, MFFO, or Adjusted MFFO
accordingly.

Market Risk and Credit Risk
Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to
interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk, however, we generally do not use derivative instruments to hedge credit/market risks or for
speculative purposes. From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency contracts and collars to hedge our foreign currency cash flow
exposures.
We are also exposed to further market risk as a result of tenant concentrations in certain industries and/or geographic regions, since adverse market
factors (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) can affect the ability of tenants in a particular industry/region to meet their respective lease obligations.
In order to manage this risk, we view our collective tenant roster as a portfolio and we attempt to diversify such portfolio so that we are not
overexposed to a particular industry or geographic region.
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities or have similar economic risks or conditions
that could cause them to default on their lease obligations to us. We regularly monitor our portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risk.
While we believe our portfolio is well-diversified, it does contain concentrations in certain areas.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our consolidated portfolio had the following significant characteristics in excess of 10% based on the
percentage of our consolidated total revenues:
•63% related to domestic properties, which included concentrations of 13% in both Texas and Florida; and
•37% related to international properties.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our portfolio had the following significant property and lease characteristics in excess of 10% in certain
areas, based on the percentage of our Stabilized NOI:
•67% related to domestic properties, which included a concentration of 16% in Florida;
•33% related to international properties; and
•35% related to self-storage properties, 32% related to office properties, and 10% related to warehouse properties.
As of December 31, 2021, our net-leased portfolio, which excludes our operating properties, had the following significant property, industry and
lease characteristics in excess of 10% in certain areas, based on the percentage of our pro rata ABR as of that date:
•40% related to domestic properties, which included a concentration of 10% in Illinois;
•60% related to international properties, which included concentrations in Norway of 12%, Spain of 11%, and the Netherlands of 10%;
•43% related to office properties, 13% related to student housing (net lease) properties, 13% related to warehouse properties, and 13% related to
hospitality properties; and
•13% related to the student housing (net lease) industry, 13% related to the hotel and leisure industry, and 11% related to the banking industry.
Interest Rate Risk
The values of our real estate investments, related fixed-rate debt obligations, and notes receivable are subject to fluctuations based on changes in
interest rates. The value of our real estate is also subject to fluctuations based on local and regional economic conditions (including the ongoing
impact of the COVD-19 pandemic and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees, which may affect our ability to refinance property-level mortgage
debt when balloon
89
Table of Contents
payments are scheduled, if we do not choose to repay the debt when due). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including
governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. An
increase in interest rates would likely cause the fair value of our assets to decrease. Increases in interest rates may also have an impact on the credit
profile of certain tenants.
We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. To limit this exposure, we have historically
attempted to obtain non-recourse secured debt financing on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. However, from time to time, we or our joint investment
partners have obtained, and may in the future obtain, variable-rate non-recourse secured debt, and, as a result, we have entered into, and may
continue to enter into, interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap agreements with counterparties.
As of December 31, 2021, a significant portion (approximately 83.8%) of our outstanding debt either bore interest at fixed rates, or was swapped or
capped to a fixed rate. Our debt obligations are more fully described in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary of Financing in the section titled
CPA:18 - Global's Management's Discussion and Analysis above. The following table presents principal cash outflows for each of the next five
years following December 31, 2021, and thereafter, based upon expected maturity dates of our debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2021

__________________
(a)Amounts are based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2021, as applicable.
The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt (which either have effectively been converted to a fixed rate through the use of
interest rate swaps) is marginally affected by changes in interest rates. A decrease or increase in interest rates of 1% would change the estimated
fair value of this debt at December 31, 2021 by an aggregate increase of $22.1 million or an aggregate decrease of $28.4 million, respectively. Annual
interest expense on our unhedged variable-rate debt at December 31, 2021 would increase or decrease by $2.0 million for each respective 1% change
in annual interest rates.
As more fully described under Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary of Financing above, a portion of our variable-rate debt in the table above
bore interest at fixed rates at December 31, 2021, but has interest rate reset features that will change the fixed interest rates to then-prevailing market
fixed rates at certain points during their term. This debt is generally not subject to short-term fluctuations in interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We own international investments, primarily in Europe, and as a result, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in various
foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the Norwegian krone, and, to a lesser extent, the British pound sterling which may affect future costs and
cash flows. We have obtained and may in the future obtain, non-recourse mortgage financing in the local currency. Volatile market conditions
arising from the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, as well as other macroeconomic factors, may result in significant fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. To the extent that currency fluctuations increase or decrease rental revenues, as translated to U.S. dollars, the
change in debt service (comprised of principal and interest, excluding balloon payments), as translated to U.S. dollars, will partially offset the effect
of fluctuations in revenue and, to some extent, mitigate the risk form changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We estimate that, for a 1%
increase or decrease in exchange rate between the euro, Norwegian krone, or British pound sterling, and the U.S. dollar, there would be a
corresponding change in the annual projected estimated cash flow (scheduled future rental revenues, net of scheduled future debt service
payments for the next 12 months) for our consolidated foreign operations at December 31, 2021, of $0.4 million for the euro, and less than $0.1
million for both the Norwegian krone and the British pound sterling, excluding the impact of our derivative instruments.
In addition, we may use currency hedging to further reduce the exposure to our equity cash flow. We are generally a net receiver of these currencies
(we receive more cash than we pay out), therefore our foreign operations

benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency.
We enter into foreign currency collars to hedge certain of our foreign currency cash flow exposures.

Date, Time and Place
The CPA:18 Special Meeting will be held in virtual format at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPA18merger, on July 26, 2022, 5:00 p.m., Eastern
Time.
Purpose
The purposes of the CPA:18 Special Meeting are to:
•consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger; and
•consider and vote upon any adjournments of the CPA:18 Special Meeting, including, without limitation, a motion to adjourn the special meeting to
another time for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to approve the Merger proposal.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors of CPA:18 - Global
At a meeting on February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors), after careful
consideration and based on the unanimous recommendation of the CPA:18 Special Committee, adopted resolutions declaring that the Merger is
advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global
and on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties, and directing that the Merger be submitted for
consideration at the CPA:18 Special Meeting. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors recommends a vote ""FOR"" approval of the Merger. Jason E.
Fox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, abstained from voting on the matters.
Record Date, Outstanding Shares and Voting Rights
CPA:18 - Global's board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 27, 2022 as the record date for the CPA:18 Special Meeting (the
""CPA:18 Record Date""). Accordingly, only holders of record of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date are entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the CPA:18 Special Meeting. As of the CPA:18 Record Date, there were 149,688,862 outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock
held by approximately 26,930 holders of record. At the CPA:18 Special Meeting, each outstanding share of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder
to one vote per share on each proposal submitted to the CPA:18 Stockholders for consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote, except
that as described below under ""Vote Required,"" W. P. Carey, the directors of CPA:18 - Global and their affiliates are not entitled to vote on the
Merger.
Quorum
The representation, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast at least 50% of all
the votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting on any matter is necessary to constitute a quorum at the CPA:18 Special Meeting.
Shares of CPA:18 Common Stock represented in person or by proxy will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at
the CPA:18 Special Meeting. For the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum, abstentions and ""broker non-votes"" will be included in
determining the number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock present and entitled to vote at the CPA:18 Special Meeting.
Vote Required
Approval of the Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all
the votes entitled to be cast on the relevant matter. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of
their affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between
CPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its advisor; and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common
Stock necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's
92
Table of Contents
directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the matter and will not be included in making such
determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not
be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the requisite approval. Abstentions and ""broker non-
votes"" will have the same effect as votes against approval of the Merger since each of the proposals requires the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
CPA:18 Voting of Proxies
If you are a holder of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date, you may authorize a proxy by completing, signing and promptly
returning the proxy card in the self-addressed stamped envelope provided. You may also authorize a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or
over the Internet as described in your proxy card. Authorizing a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or over the Internet will not limit your right
to attend the CPA:18 Special Meeting virtually and vote via the special meeting website. Those stockholders of record who choose to authorize a
proxy by telephone or over the Internet must do so no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on July 25, 2022. All shares of CPA:18 Common Stock
represented by properly executed proxy cards received before or at the CPA:18 Special Meeting and all proxies properly submitted by telephone or
over the Internet will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxy cards, telephone or
Internet submissions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the shares will be voted ""FOR"" each of the proposals. You
are urged to indicate how you vote your shares whether you authorize a proxy by proxy card, by telephone or over the Internet.
If a properly executed proxy card is returned or properly submitted by telephone or over the Internet and the stockholder has abstained from voting
on one or more of the proposals, the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock represented by the proxy will be considered present at the special meeting for
purposes of determining a quorum but will not be considered to have been voted on the abstained proposals. For the proposal to approve the
Merger, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the Merger. For the proposal to adjourn the meeting to solicit additional
proxies, abstentions (which are not considered votes cast) will have no effect on the vote on such proposal.
If your shares are held in an account controlled by a broker or financial advisor, you must instruct your broker or financial advisor on how to vote
your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or financial advisor holding shares that indicates that the broker or financial advisor
does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposals, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining
the presence of a quorum but will not be considered to have been voted on the proposals. Under applicable rules and regulations, brokers, banks or
other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters but do not have the discretion to vote on non-routine matters. The proposal to
approve the Merger is a non-routine matter. Accordingly, your broker or financial advisor will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on
how to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker or financial advisor. If you do not provide voting instructions, your
shares will be considered ""broker non-votes"" because the broker or financial advisor will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares.
Therefore, your failure to provide voting instructions to the broker or financial advisor will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the
Merger.
Adjournment
Although it is not currently expected, the CPA:18 Special Meeting may be adjourned to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to
approve the Merger. In that event, CPA:18 - Global may ask its stockholders to vote upon the proposal to consider the adjournment of the CPA:18
Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies but not upon the proposal to approve the Merger. If CPA:18 Stockholders approve this proposal,
CPA:18 - Global could adjourn the CPA:18 Special Meeting and use the time to solicit additional proxies. Any shares of CPA:18 Common Stock that
were voted against approval of the Merger will not be voted in favor of the adjournment of the CPA:18 Special Meeting in order to solicit additional
proxies.

Table of Contents
Revocation of Proxies
Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked, and the vote changed, by the person giving it at any time before it is voted. Proxies
may be revoked by:
•delivering to the Corporate Secretary of CPA:18 - Global, at or before the vote is taken at the CPA:18 Special Meeting, a later-dated written notice
stating that you would like to revoke your proxy and change your vote;
•properly executing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to the Corporate Secretary of CPA:18 - Global before the vote is
taken at the CPA:18 Special Meeting; or
•attending the CPA:18 Special Meeting virtually and voting via the special meeting website, although attendance at the CPA:18 Special Meeting will
not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy or a change of your vote.
Proxies authorized by telephone or via the Internet may only be revoked in writing in accordance with the above instructions.
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent to CPA:18 - Global, One Manhattan West, 395 9th Avenue, 58th Floor, New
York, New York 10001, Attention: Corporate Secretary, so as to be received prior to the CPA:18 Special Meeting, or hand delivered to the Corporate
Secretary of CPA:18 - Global at or before the taking of the vote at the CPA:18 Special Meeting.
Shares Beneficially Owned by W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global Directors and Officers
As of the CPA:18 Record Date, W. P. Carey and its affiliates beneficially owned 8,556,733 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate,
representing 5.7% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock, and the directors of CPA:18 - Global beneficially owned 76,223 shares of
CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate, representing less than 1% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock. Each share of CPA:18
Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will automatically be
cancelled and retired and cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.
Solicitation of Proxies; Expenses
All expenses of CPA:18 - Global's solicitation of proxies from its stockholders, including the cost of mailing this proxy statement/prospectus to
CPA:18 Stockholders, will be paid by CPA:18 - Global. CPA:18 - Global may utilize some of the officers and employees of W. P. Carey's wholly-owned
subsidiary, CAM, and certain of W. P. Carey’s consultants (who, in each case, will receive no compensation in addition to their regular salaries or
hourly compensation, as applicable, for these services) to solicit proxies personally and by telephone. In addition, W. P. Carey has engaged
Broadridge to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the meeting and estimate that W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global will pay Broadridge a fee of
approximately $200,000. W. P. Carey has also agreed to reimburse Broadridge for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in
connection with the proxy solicitation and to indemnify Broadridge against certain losses, costs and expenses. No portion of the amount that W. P.
Carey is required to pay Broadridge is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. The agreement between W. P. Carey and Broadridge may be
terminated (i) by either party for any reason upon 90 days' prior written notice, (ii) by the non-defaulting party if the other party fails to cure such
default within 90 days' of written notice thereof, and (iii) by either party if the other party files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or an involuntary
petition is filed against it, the other party is adjudged bankrupt, a court assumes jurisdiction of the other party's assets under the federal
reorganization act, a trustee or receiver is appointed by a court for all of a substantial portion of the assets of the other party, the other party
becomes insolvent or the other party makes an assignment of its assets for the benefit of its creditors. The agreement between W. P. Carey and
Broadridge also limits any damages to the fees and costs due and payable to Broadridge.

Proposal 1: The Merger Proposal
(Proposal 1 on CPA:18 Proxy Card)
CPA:18 Stockholders are asked to approve the Merger proposal. For a summary of and detailed information regarding the Merger proposal, see the
information about the Merger and the Merger Agreement throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, including the information set forth in
sections entitled “The Merger” beginning on page 33 and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 97. A copy of the Merger Agreement is
attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, approval of the Merger proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger proposal is
not approved, the Merger will not be completed.
Approval of the Merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of CPA:18
Common Stock entitled to vote. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of their affiliates
owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote on or consent to the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between CPA:18 - Global
and affiliates of its advisor; and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock
necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not
entitled to be voted on the Merger and will not be included in making such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by
any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the
Merger receives the requisite approval.
The CPA:18 - Global board of directors (including the unanimous recommendation of the independent directors) recommends that CPA:18
Stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger proposal. Jason E. Fox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, abstained from voting on the
Merger proposal.
Proposal 2: The Adjournment Proposal
(Proposal 2 on CPA:18 Proxy Card)
CPA:18 Stockholders are being asked to consider and vote on the Adjournment proposal. If, at the CPA:18 Special Meeting, the number of shares
of CPA:18 Common Stock present or represented by proxy and voting for the approval of the Merger proposal is insufficient to approve such
proposal, CPA:18 - Global intends to move to adjourn the CPA:18 Special Meeting to another place, date or time in order to enable the board of
directors of CPA:18 to solicit additional proxies for approval of the Merger proposal. Approval of the Adjournment proposal requires that the
number of votes cast for the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast against the proposal. If the Adjournment proposal is approved, CPA:18 -
Global may adjourn the CPA:18 Special Meeting to another place, date or time. If the CPA:18 Special Meeting is adjourned for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies, CPA:18 Stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their
uses.
The CPA:18 - Global board of directors (including the unanimous recommendation of the independent directors) recommends that CPA:18
Stockholders vote “FOR” the Adjournment proposal.

The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated
by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. As a stockholder, you are not a third-party beneficiary of the Merger Agreement and therefore you
may not directly enforce any of its terms and conditions.
This summary may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global urge
you to carefully read the full text of the Merger Agreement because it is the legal document that governs the Merger. The Merger Agreement is not
intended to provide you with any factual information about W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global. In particular, the assertions embodied in the
representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (and summarized below) are qualified by information in the documents that each
of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global filed with the SEC prior to the Effective Date, as well as by certain disclosure letters, which certain of the parties
delivered to other parties in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, that modify, qualify and create exceptions to the
representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or
complete as of any specified date, may apply contractual standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by
investors or that is different from standards of materiality generally applicable under the U.S. federal securities laws or may not be intended as
statements of fact but rather as a way of allocating risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties and other
provisions of the Merger Agreement, and the description of such provisions in this proxy statement/prospectus, should not be read alone but
instead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings that each of W. P. Carey and
CPA:18 - Global file with the SEC and the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus. See ""Where You Can Find More Information""
beginning on page 171.
The Merger
The Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time, CPA:18 - Global will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as
the surviving entity and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey. At such time, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
MGCL and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the ""MLLCA""), the separate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger will take place commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date specified by the
parties, which will be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) (such date, the ""Original Closing Date""), by means of a virtual closing through the electronic exchange of signatures, or at such other
time and place as the parties agree in writing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived, but the tenant
purchase options with respect to CPA:18 - Global's Iberian student-housing portfolio subject to the Framework Agreement dated as of December
20, 2019 (the ""Designated Portfolio"") have been exercised and W. P. Carey is actively working to complete the sale of the Designated Portfolio,
then W. P. Carey has the unilateral right to extend the Original Closing Date until the earliest to occur of (x) the second business day following the
closing of the sale of the Designated Portfolio; (y) the first business day before August 31, 2022 and (z) the second business day following the date
on which W. P. Carey provides written notice to the CPA:18 Special Committee indicating that it no longer desires to pursue the foregoing extension
option. If W. P. Carey exercises this extension option, the cash component of the Per Share Merger Consideration will be subject to an upward
adjustment, as more thoroughly described below.
The Effective Time of the Merger will be specified in the Articles of Merger, provided that such time does not exceed 30 days after the Articles of
Merger are accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and
97
Table of Contents
Taxation of Maryland. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.
Conversion of Securities
As of the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such share, the rights attaching to such share will be converted automatically into the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration consisting of (i) 0.0978 (the ""Exchange Ratio"") of a validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of W. P. Carey Common Stock (the ""stock consideration""), and (ii) $3.00 in cash, which will be reduced
if CPA:18 - Global pays a dividend exceeding its regular quarterly dividend and may be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger
Agreement to defer the closing of the Merger in order to complete the sale of certain CPA:18 - Global properties (including the cash, if any, paid in
respect of fractional shares (as more thoroughly described below), the ""cash component,"" and together with the stock consideration, the “Per
Share Merger Consideration”).
Each share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. In addition, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey subsidiary will receive any Per
Share Merger Consideration for any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it. No fractional shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be issued
under the Merger Agreement. To the extent that a holder of CPA:18 Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of W.
P. Carey Common Stock, computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder will
instead receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $10.45.
Based on the number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding on the CPA:18 Record Date, W. P. Carey expects to issue approximately 13.8
million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Upon such Stock Issuance, the W. P. Carey Stockholders and the
CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and any W. P. Carey subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined company,
respectively.
Recordation of Exchange; Payment of Per Share Merger Consideration
As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, W. P. Carey will cause its transfer agent to record the Stock Issuance in connection with the
Merger to the holders of CPA:18 Common Stock on W. P. Carey's stock records in accordance with the Merger Agreement. No physical share
certificates will be delivered. Prior to the Effective Time, W. P. Carey will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to CPA:18 -
Global to act as agent for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (the ""Paying and Exchange Agent""). W. P. Carey must take all steps
necessary to enable and cause the surviving entity to provide to the Paying and Exchange Agent immediately following the Effective Time the
aggregate cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon cancellation of the CPA:18 Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
share of W. P. Carey Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the tenth business day after the
Effective Time, the Paying and Exchange Agent will pay to each holder of CPA:18 Common Stock the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to
receive for the cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration and in lieu of any fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock.
Share Transfer Books
At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of CPA:18 - Global will be closed, and no
subsequent transfers of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock will be registered on the share transfer books of the surviving entity.

CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a ""CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction"" means a bona-fide proposal for a CPA:18 Competing

view to the CPA:18 Stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) would result in such third
party owning, directly or indirectly, at least 90% of the CPA:18 Common Stock then outstanding (or all or substantially all of the equity of the
surviving entity in a merger) or at least 90% of the assets of CPA:18 - Global and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) is reasonably capable of

CPA:18 Special Committee, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a CPA:18 Superior Competing
Transaction, after having complied with Section 4.5(d) of the Merger Agreement, and (B) with respect to any Person who is not an Exempted
Person, the CPA:18 Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take such action

financing commitments related thereto, which will include any fee letters, which letters may be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided
therein, as applicable) (a ""Change of Recommendation Notice""); (y) during the three business days following W. P. Carey's and Merger Sub's
receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice, CPA:18 - Global must, and must cause its officers, directors, investment advisors, agents,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders or representatives or any controlled Affiliates of CPA:18 - Global, or
any CPA:18 - Global subsidiary to, negotiate with W. P. Carey and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent that W. P. Carey and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) to make amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so as to obviate the need for the proposed termination of the
Merger Agreement or the proposed Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable; and (z) following the close of business on the last day of the
three business days or such greater period of time as may be permitted by the CPA:18 Special Committee in its sole discretion, the CPA:18 Special
Committee has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into account any
amendments to the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by W. P. Carey and Merger Sub in response to the Change of Recommendation Notice,
that such CPA:18 Competing Transaction continues to constitute a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction (whether or not from an Exempted
Person), and with respect to any Person who is not an Exempted Person, a failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the duties of the members of the CPA:18 Special Committee under applicable law.

must deliver a new Change of Recommendation Notice to W. P. Carey and Merger Sub, and CPA:18 - Global will be required to comply again with
the requirements of Section 4.5(d) of the
104

person, if any, that, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the CPA:18 Special Committee has determined to be an Exempted Person and (ii)
provide W. P. Carey with the material terms and conditions of any CPA:18 Competing Transaction received from any Exempted Person prior to the
Solicitation Period End Date. CPA:18 - Global must keep W. P. Carey reasonably and promptly informed of any material changes in the status, terms
or conditions of any CPA:18 Competing Transaction received from any Exempted Person. Except as may relate to an Exempted Person, from and
after the Solicitation Period End Date, CPA:18 - Global must (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt),
advise W. P. Carey of receipt by CPA:18 - Global or any of its affiliates of (A) any CPA:18 Competing Transaction or (B) any request for information

Transaction or request (including the identity of the party making such CPA:18 Competing Transaction), (ii) keep W. P. Carey fully and promptly
informed (and in any event within 24 hours) of any material changes in the status, terms or conditions of any such CPA:18 Competing Transaction
(it being understood that any change or modification to any financial term or condition of any CPA:18 Competing Transaction will be deemed to be
a material change) or request, and (iii) promptly provide W. P. Carey with (a) an unredacted copy of any such CPA:18 Competing Transactions made
in writing (including any financing commitments relating thereto, which will include any fee letters (it being understood that any such fee letter may
be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided therein)) and (b) a written summary of the material terms of any CPA:18 Competing

(c)Excludes certain properties leased to the tenants that we consolidate and in which we have a 100% ownership interest.
Terms and Definitions
Pro Rata Metrics - The portfolio information above contains certain metrics prepared on a pro rata basis. We refer to these metrics as pro rata
metrics. We have a number of investments, usually with our affiliates, in which our economic ownership is less than 100%. On a full consolidation
basis, we report 100% of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of those investments that are deemed to be under our control or for which
we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, even if our ownership is less than 100%. Also, for all other jointly owned investments, which we do
not control, we report our net investment and our net income or loss from that investment. On a pro rata basis, we generally present our
proportionate share, based on our economic ownership of these jointly owned investments, of the portfolio metrics of those investments.
Multiplying each of our jointly owned investments' financial statement line items by our percentage ownership and adding or subtracting those
amounts from our totals, as applicable, may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding an ownership interest of less than
100% in our jointly owned investments.

CORPORATE PROPERTY ASSOCIATES 18 GLOBAL INC_20220427_DEFM14A_20041574_4449712.Pdf,CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,"CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
When used in this section ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions,"" unless otherwise specifically stated or the context otherwise
requires, the term ""the Company,"" ""we"" and ""our"" refers to W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries.
Policies and Procedures with Respect to Related Party Transactions
The executive officers and directors are committed to upholding the highest legal and ethical conduct in fulfilling their responsibilities and
recognize that related party transactions can present a heightened risk of potential or actual conflicts of interest. Employees, officers and directors
have an obligation to act in the best interest of the Company and to put such interests at all times ahead of their own personal interests. In addition,
all employees, officers and directors of the Company should seek to avoid any action or interest that conflicts with or gives the appearance of a
conflict with the Company's interests. According to the Code of Ethics, a conflict of interest occurs when a person's private economic or other
interest conflicts with, is reasonably expected to conflict with, or may give the appearance of conflicting with, any interest of the Company. The
following potential conflicts of interest are prohibited, and employees, officers and directors of W. P. Carey must take all reasonable steps to detect,
prevent, and eliminate such conflicts:
•Working in any capacity - including service on a board of directors or trustees, or on a committee thereof - for a competitor while employed by the
Company.
•Competing with the Company for the purchase, sale or financing of property, services or other interests.
•Soliciting or accepting any personal benefit from a third party, including any competitor, customer or service provider, in exchange for any benefit
from the Company. Applicable Company policies may permit the acceptance of gifts and entertainment from third parties, subject to certain
limitations. Individuals are expected to adhere to these policies where applicable and in general to limit acceptance of benefits to those that are
reasonable and customary in a business environment and that are not reasonably likely to improperly influence the individual.
Other potential conflicts of interest, while not prohibited in all cases, may be harmful to the Company and therefore must be disclosed in
accordance with the Code of Ethics. The Chief Ethics Officer of the Company has primary authority and responsibility for the administration of the
Code of Ethics subject to the oversight of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or, in the case of accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters, the Audit Committee.
Relationship with Managed Programs
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, W. P. Carey earns revenue as the advisor to the Managed Programs. Under advisory agreements that the
Company has with each of the Managed Programs, the Company performs services and earns asset management revenue related to the day-to-day
management of the Managed Programs and provides transaction-related services and earns structuring revenue in connection with structuring and
negotiating investments and any related financing on their behalf. In addition, the Company provides further services and generally earns revenue
when each of the Managed Programs is liquidated, although, as more thoroughly described below in the section titled ""Merger Agreement"", in
connection with the Merger, the Company has agreed to waive certain fees otherwise payable by CPA:18 - Global. The Company is also reimbursed
for certain costs incurred in providing services, including the cost of personnel provided for the administration of the Managed Programs. For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2021, total asset-based revenue earned was approximately $15.4 million, while reimbursed costs totaled
approximately $4.0 million. For 2021, the Company elected to receive asset management revenue from CPA:18 - Global in shares of its stock. With

The following contains a summary of certain material provisions of the W. P. Carey Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the ""W. P. Carey
Charter"") and the W. P. Carey Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws (the ""W. P. Carey Bylaws"") relating to the shares of W. P. Carey Common
Stock that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and can be found at Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively. The
following description of the shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws.
General
The W. P. Carey Charter provides that W. P. Carey has the authority to issue 500,000,000 shares of stock, $0.001 par value per share, consisting of
450,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. A majority of
the entire board of directors of W. P. Carey, without any action by the W. P. Carey Stockholders, may amend the W. P. Carey Charter from time to
time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that W. P. Carey has
authority to issue. W. P. Carey expects that approximately 13.8 million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be issued in the Merger.
Common Stock
All shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger contemplated by this proxy statement/prospectus will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Subject to the rights of any other class or series of stock and to the provisions of the W. P. Carey
Charter restricting the transfer and ownership of shares of our stock, each outstanding share of W. P. Carey Common Stock entitles the holder to
one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including one vote for each director to be elected in the election of directors, and,
except as provided with respect to any other class or series of shares of our stock, the holders of W. P. Carey Common Stock possess exclusive
voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of W.
P. Carey Common Stock can elect all of the directors then standing for election, and the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any
directors.
Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert, sell all or substantially all of its assets,
engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless declared advisable by the board of
directors and approved by the affirmative vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast on the
matter, unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation's
charter. The W. P. Carey Charter requires the affirmative vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter to approve such matters, except that any amendment to the sections of the W. P. Carey Charter concerning the
removal of directors, restrictions on transfer and ownership of shares and the voting requirements for the amendment of such provisions must be
declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of
all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
Maryland law permits the merger of a 90% or more owned subsidiary with or into its parent without stockholder approval provided (a) the charter of
the successor is not amended other than in certain minor respects and (b) the contract rights of any stock of the successor issued in the merger in
exchange for stock of the other corporation are identical to the contract rights of the stock for which it is exchanged. Also, because Maryland law
may not require the stockholders of a parent corporation to approve a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary entity,
including where a substantial number of operating assets are held by the subsidiary, as in our situation, our subsidiaries may be able to merge or
sell all or substantially all of their assets without a vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders.
Holders of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock are entitled to receive distributions paid ratably on the common stock if and when authorized by
our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available for the payment of distributions. They also are entitled to share ratably in
our assets legally available for distribution to
122
Table of Contents
the W. P. Carey Stockholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, after payment of or adequate provision has been made for
all of our known debts and liabilities. These rights are subject to the preferential rights in respect of distributions or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of any other class or series of our stock that we may subsequently classify or reclassify and to the provisions of the W. P. Carey Charter
regarding restrictions on transfer and ownership of W. P. Carey stock.
Holders of our shares of stock generally have no appraisal, preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights or preemptive
rights to subscribe for any of our securities, except as may be provided under the terms of any class or series of stock that we may subsequently
classify or reclassify. Subject to the restrictions on transfer and ownership of stock contained in the W. P. Carey Charter and the rights of any other
class or series of stock that W. P. Carey may subsequently classify or reclassify, each share of common stock has equal distribution, liquidation and
other rights.
Preferred Stock; Power to Reclassify Shares of Our Stock
The W. P. Carey Charter authorizes the board of directors of W. P. Carey to classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to
reclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock. Prior to
issuance of shares of any class or series of stock, our board of directors is required by Maryland law and the W. P. Carey Charter to fix, subject to
the W. P. Carey Charter restrictions on transfer and ownership, the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series of stock. Therefore,
our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for you or otherwise be in
your best interests.
Power to Increase or Decrease Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock
Our board of directors has the power (a) to amend the W. P. Carey Charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares
of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue, (b) to issue additional shares of common stock
or preferred stock and (c) to classify unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock or to reclassify any previously classified, but
unissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock, into other classes or series of stock and thereafter to issue the classified or reclassified
shares of stock. We believe this ability provides us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in
meeting other needs which might arise. The additional classes or series of stock, as well as our common stock, are available for issuance without
further action by the W. P. Carey Stockholders, unless stockholder action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which
our securities may be listed or the terms of any classes or series of stock that we may subsequently classify or reclassify. Although our board of
directors does not currently intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series of common or preferred stock that could, depending
upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a
premium price for you or otherwise be in your best interests.
Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer
The W. P. Carey Charter provides that our board of directors may decide whether it is in the best interests of our company to qualify and maintain
status as a REIT under the Code. In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, our shares of stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more
persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, no more than 50% of
the value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined by the Code to include
certain entities) during the last half of any taxable year. Neither the requirement to be held by 100 or more persons, or the provision disallowing
ownership by five or fewer individuals apply to the first taxable year of a REIT.
123
Table of Contents
To help us to qualify as a REIT, among other purposes, the W. P. Carey Charter, subject to certain exceptions, contains restrictions on the number of
shares of our stock that a person may own. The W. P. Carey Charter provides that generally no person may own beneficially, or be deemed to own
by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, either (i) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the
aggregate outstanding shares of our stock excluding any outstanding shares of our stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax
purposes or (ii) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate outstanding shares of W. P. Carey
Common Stock excluding any outstanding shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes.
The W. P. Carey Charter also prohibits any person from (a) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would result in our being
""closely held"" under Section 856(h) of the Code, (b) transferring shares of our stock if such transfer would result in our stock being beneficially
owned by fewer than 100 persons, (c) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would cause us to own, directly or indirectly,
10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of our company (or a tenant of any entity owned or controlled by us), (d) beneficially or
constructively owning shares of our stock that would cause any independent contractor to not be treated as such under Section 856(d)(3) of the
Code, or (e) beneficially or constructively owning shares of stock which will otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Any person who
acquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of our stock that will or may violate any of the foregoing
restrictions on transferability and ownership, and any person who would have owned shares of our stock that resulted in a transfer of shares to a
charitable trust (as described below), will be required to give written notice immediately to us, or in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction,
to give at least 15 days' prior written notice to us, and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of
such transfer on our status as a REIT. The foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines
that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required for us to qualify as a REIT.
Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person from the above ownership limits and the
restrictions described in clauses (c) and (d) above. However, the board of directors may not grant an exemption to any person unless the board of
directors obtains such representations, covenants and undertakings as the board of directors may deem appropriate in order to determine that
granting the exemption would not result in losing our status as a REIT. As a condition of granting the exemption, our board of directors may require
a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the board of directors in its sole discretion, in
order to determine or ensure our status as a REIT.
Our board of directors may increase or decrease the common stock ownership limit and/or the aggregate stock ownership limit so long as the
change would not result in five or fewer persons beneficially owning more than 49.9% in value of our outstanding stock. Any decrease in the
common stock ownership limit and/or the aggregate stock ownership limit shall not apply to any person whose percentage ownership of stock is in
excess of the decreased ownership limits until such time as such person's percentage ownership of stock equals or falls below the decreased
ownership limits. Absent an exemption from the ownership limits, any further acquisition of shares of our stock by such person will be in violation
of the ownership limits unless and until such person's percentage ownership of stock falls below the ownership limit (in which case such person
may acquire shares up to such ownership limits).
Pursuant to the W. P. Carey Charter, if any transfer of our shares of stock occurs that, if effective, would result in any person beneficially or
constructively owning shares of stock in excess, or in violation, of the above ownership limitations or restrictions on transfer, known as a
prohibited owner, then that number of shares of stock, the beneficial or constructive ownership of which otherwise would cause such person to
violate the ownership limitations or restrictions on transfer (rounded up to the nearest whole share), will be automatically transferred to a charitable
trust for the exclusive benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the prohibited owner will not acquire any rights in such shares. This automatic transfer
will be considered effective as of the close of business on the business day before the violative transfer. If the transfer to the charitable trust would
not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of the above transfer or ownership limitations, then the transfer of that number of shares of
stock that otherwise would cause any person to violate the above limitations will be null and void. Shares of stock held in the charitable trust will
continue to constitute issued and outstanding shares of our stock. The prohibited owner will not benefit economically from ownership of any
shares of stock held in the charitable trust, will have no
124
Table of Contents
rights to distributions and will not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares of stock held in the charitable trust. The
trustee of the charitable trust will be designated by us and must be unaffiliated with us or any prohibited owner and will have all voting rights and
rights to distributions with respect to shares of stock held in the charitable trust, and these rights will be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the
trust's charitable beneficiary. Any dividend or other distribution paid before our discovery that shares of stock have been transferred to the trustee
will be paid by the recipient of such dividend or distribution to the trustee upon demand, and any dividend or other distribution authorized but
unpaid will be paid when due to the trustee. Any dividend or distribution so paid to the trustee will be held in trust for the trust's charitable
beneficiary. The prohibited owner will have no voting rights with respect to shares of stock held in the charitable trust, and, subject to Maryland
law, effective as of the date that such shares of stock have been transferred to the trustee, the trustee, in its sole discretion, will have the authority
to:
•rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited owner prior to our discovery that such shares have been transferred to the trustee; and
•recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the trust's beneficiary.
However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee will not have the authority to rescind and recast such vote.
Within 20 days of receiving notice from us that shares of stock have been transferred to the charitable trust, and unless we buy the shares first as
described below, the trustee will sell the shares of stock held in the charitable trust to a person, designated by the trustee, whose ownership of the
shares will not violate the ownership limitations in the W. P. Carey Charter. Upon the sale, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold
will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner and to the charitable beneficiary. The prohibited
owner will receive the lesser of:
•the price paid by the prohibited owner for the shares or, if the prohibited owner did not give value for the shares in connection with the event
causing the shares to be held in the charitable trust (for example, in the case of a gift or devise), the market price of the shares on the day of the
event causing the shares to be held in the charitable trust; and
•the price per share received by the trustee from the sale or other disposition of the shares held in the charitable trust (less any commission and
other expenses of a sale).
The trustee may reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited
owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. Any net sale proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the prohibited owner will be paid
immediately to the charitable beneficiary. If, before our discovery that shares of stock have been transferred to the charitable trust, such shares are
sold by a prohibited owner, then:
•such shares will be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the charitable trust; and
•to the extent that the prohibited owner received an amount for such shares that exceeds the amount that the prohibited owner was entitled to
receive as described above, the excess must be paid to the trustee upon demand.
In addition, shares of stock held in the charitable trust will be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal
to the lesser of:
•the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the charitable trust (or, in the case of a gift or devise, the market price at the
time of the gift or devise); and
•the market price on the date we, or our designee, accept such offer.
We may reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited owner and
owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. We may pay the amount of such reduction to the trustee for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary.
We will have the right to accept the offer until
125
Table of Contents
the trustee has sold the shares of stock held in the charitable trust. Upon such a sale to us, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares
sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner and any distributions held by the trustee will
be paid to the charitable beneficiary.
All certificates, if any, representing shares of our stock will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.
Every owner of more than 5% (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder) in value of the
outstanding shares of our stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, must give written notice to us stating the name and address of
such owner, the number of shares of each class and series of shares of our stock that the owner beneficially owns and a description of the manner
in which the shares are held. Each such owner must also provide to us such additional information as we may request in order to determine the
effect, if any, of the owner's beneficial ownership on our status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with our ownership limitations. In addition,
each of the W. P. Carey Stockholders, whether or not an owner of 5% or more of our stock, must upon demand provide to us such information as we
may request, in good faith, in order to determine our status as a REIT and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental
authority or to determine such compliance and to ensure our compliance with the ownership restrictions in the W. P. Carey Charter.
The ownership and transfer limitations in the W. P. Carey Charter could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of us that might
involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of the W. P. Carey Stockholders.

The following description is a summary of certain material provisions of Maryland law and of the W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws. Certain
provisions of Maryland law and the W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
takeover of the combined company (including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the
then current prices). The summary is not complete. We encourage you to read the W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws, which are incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.
W. P. Carey Board of Directors
The W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting our full board of directors will be not less than the minimum
number required by Maryland law. The W. P. Carey Bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting our full board of directors will not
exceed 25 and the W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting our full board of directors may only
be increased or decreased by a vote of a majority of our entire board of directors. The W. P. Carey Charter provides that any and all vacancies on
the board of directors (including as a result of an increase in the number of directors constituting our full board of directors) may be filled only by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. Under the W. P. Carey
Charter, we have elected to be subject to Section 3-804(c) of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL so that any and all vacancies (including as a result of
an increase in the number of directors constituting our full board of directors) on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the remaining directors even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. Any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve
for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies. The W. P. Carey
Charter provides that a director may be removed only for cause and only by the stockholders upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes
entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. ""For cause"" means, with respect to any particular director, conviction of a felony or a final
judgment of court of competent jurisdiction holding that such director caused demonstrable, material harm to us through bad faith or active and
deliberate dishonesty. However, because of the board's exclusive power to fill vacant directorships, stockholders will be precluded from filling the
vacancies created by any removal with their own nominees. Each member of our board of directors is elected by the W. P. Carey Stockholders to
serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. Holders of shares of our common
stock have no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. In uncontested elections, directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast
with respect to such nominee by the stockholders present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting. If, however, the number of nominees for election to
the board of directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected at that meeting and in certain other contested elections, directors are elected by
a plurality of all the votes cast at that meeting. If the holders of any class or series of stock that we may subsequently classify or reclassify shall
have the right to elect one or more directors separately as a class, then such director or directors so elected shall serve for the remainder of the term
in which such vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly elected and qualifies. Additionally, any such director or directors may be removed
only by the holders of such class or series.
Action by Stockholders
Under the MGCL, stockholder action by common stockholders can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by unanimous
consent in lieu of a meeting, unless the charter provides for a lesser percentage (which the W. P. Carey Charter does not). Stockholder action by
preferred stockholders can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by a consent in lieu of a meeting by the holders of
shares entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a stockholders' meeting
if the corporation gives notice of the action to each holder of the class of stock not later than 10 days after the effective time of the action, unless
the charter provides otherwise (which the W. P. Carey Charter does). The W. P. Carey Charter provides that any action required or permitted to be
taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting if a unanimous consent which sets forth the action is given by each
stockholder entitled to vote on the matter in writing or by electronic transmission. Special meetings of stockholders may be called by our board of
directors, the Chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or our
127
Table of Contents
President, and must be called, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and information requirements by the stockholders requesting the
meeting, by our Corporate Secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on any
matter that may properly be considered at such meeting. These provisions, combined with the advance notice provisions of the W. P. Carey Bylaws,
which are summarized below, may have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal until the next annual meeting. (See also ""Risk
Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - The W. P. Carey Charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of
control transaction."")
Amendment or Supplement to the W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws
The W. P. Carey Charter may be amended only if the amendment is declared advisable by the board of directors of W. P. Carey and is approved by
the affirmative vote of the W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, unless the
amendment either is permitted to be made without stockholder approval under the MGCL or the W. P. Carey Charter requires a different level of
stockholder approval. As permitted by the MGCL, the W. P. Carey Charter contains a provision permitting our directors, without any action by the
W. P. Carey Stockholders, to amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of
shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. In addition, the W. P. Carey Charter contains provisions permitting our board
of directors to classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to reclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of
common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock. The board of directors of W. P. Carey has the power to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal any provision of the W. P. Carey Bylaws and make new bylaws. In addition, the W. P. Carey Stockholders, by the approval of at least a
majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter, may alter or repeal any provision of the W. P. Carey Bylaws or adopt new provisions of the W.
P. Carey Bylaws. Any amendment of the provisions of the W. P. Carey Charter relating to the removal of directors, the restrictions on transfer and
ownership of shares or the requirements for the amendment of either of these provisions of the W. P. Carey Charter must be declared advisable by
our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled to cast not less than two-thirds of all of the votes entitled
to be cast on the matter.
Dissolution
W. P. Carey's dissolution must be declared advisable by a majority of the entire board of directors of W. P. Carey and approved by the affirmative
vote of the W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
Business Combinations
Maryland law prohibits ""business combinations"" between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years
after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or transfer of equity securities, liquidation
plan or reclassification of equity securities. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as:
•any person or entity who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock; or
•an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner,
directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding stock.
A person is not an interested stockholder if our board of directors approves in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have
become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, our board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to
compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by our board of directors.
128
Table of Contents
After the five-year prohibition and in addition to any vote otherwise required by Maryland law and the W. P. Carey Charter, any business
combination between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by our board of
directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least:
•80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our then-outstanding shares of voting stock; and
•two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our voting stock other than stock held by the interested stockholder with whom or with
whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or stock held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if our common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their
shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its stock.
The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of
directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
Pursuant to the statute, the board of directors of W. P. Carey, by resolution, has exempted any business combinations between W. P. Carey and any
person who is an existing, or becomes in the future an, ""interested stockholder"". Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote
requirements will not apply to business combinations between W. P. Carey and any such person. As a result, such persons may be able to enter
into business combinations with W. P. Carey that may not be in the best interest of the W. P. Carey Stockholders, without compliance with the
super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. Additionally, this resolution may be altered, revoked or repealed in whole
or in part at any time and W. P. Carey may opt back into the business combination provisions of the MGCL. If this resolution is revoked or repealed,
the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
Control Share Acquisitions
Maryland law provides that holders of ""control shares"" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" have no voting rights,
except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter. Shares owned by the acquiror or by officers or by employees who are also our directors are excluded from the shares entitled to vote on the
matter. ""Control shares"" are voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock currently owned by the acquiring person, or in
respect of which the acquiring person is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would
entitle the acquiring person to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power:
•one-tenth or more but less than one-third;
•one-third or more but less than a majority; or
•a majority or more of all voting power.
Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A
""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. A person who has made
or proposes to make a control share acquisition may compel our board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50
days of the demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. The right to compel the calling of a special meeting is subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including an undertaking to pay the expenses of the meeting. If no request for a meeting is made, we may present the question at
any stockholders' meeting.
If voting rights are not approved at the stockholders' meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver the statement required by Maryland law,
then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, we may redeem any or all of the control shares, except those for which voting rights have
previously been approved, for fair value. Fair value is

Table of Contents
determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror
or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of the shares were considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are
approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may
exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares for purposes of these appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by
the acquiror in the control share acquisition. The control share acquisition statute does not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or
share exchange if we are a party to the transaction, nor does it apply to acquisitions approved by or exempted by the W. P. Carey Charter or W. P.
Carey Bylaws.
The W. P. Carey Bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of W. P.
Carey stock and, consequently, the control share acquisition statute will not apply to W. P. Carey unless the board of directors of W. P. Carey later
amends the W. P. Carey Bylaws to modify or eliminate this provision, which it may do without W. P. Carey Stockholder approval, and which it may
make effective prospectively or retrospectively.
Maryland Unsolicited Takeovers Act
Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act, and at least
three independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of five provisions:
•a classified board;
•a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director;
•a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of directors;
•a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in
which the vacancy occurred; and
•a majority requirement for the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders.
In the W. P. Carey Charter, we have elected that vacancies on the board be filled only by the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do
not constitute a quorum, and for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred. Through provisions in the W. P.
Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we (a) require the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled to cast at least two-
thirds of all votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors for the removal of any director from the board, (b) vest in the board the
exclusive power to fix the number of directorships and (c) provide that unless called by our Chairman of our board of directors, our President, our
Chief Executive Officer or our board of directors, a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our Corporate Secretary upon the written
request of (and satisfaction of certain procedural and information requirements by) the stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all
the votes entitled to be cast on any matter that may be properly considered at the meeting.
In January 2015, the board of directors of W. P. Carey resolved to opt out of the provision of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL that, absent such
resolution, would have permitted the board of directors of W. P. Carey to unilaterally divide itself into classes without W. P. Carey Stockholder
approval (commonly referred to as a ""classified board""). Although W. P. Carey did not have a classified board at that time, by opting out of this
provision the board of directors of W. P. Carey cannot elect to become a classified board in the future without approval of the W. P. Carey
Stockholders.
Limitation of Liability and Indemnification
Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation
and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from:
•actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services; or
130
Table of Contents
•active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action.
The W. P. Carey Charter contains such a provision that eliminates directors' and officers' liability for money damages to the maximum extent
permitted by Maryland law. These limitations of liability do not apply to liabilities arising under the federal securities laws and do not generally
affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission. The W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws also provide that we must
indemnify (to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law), and pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a
proceeding to, any individual who is a present or former director or officer of W. P. Carey or a predecessor of W. P. Carey from and against any claim
or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her service in such capacity as a director
or officer. Additionally, the W. P. Carey Charter provides that we may, indemnify, if and to the extent authorized and determined to be appropriate in
accordance with applicable law, any person permitted, but not required, to be indemnified under Maryland law by W. P. Carey or a predecessor of
W. P. Carey.
Maryland law requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which the W. P. Carey Charter does not) to indemnify a director or
officer who has been successful in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she was made, or was threatened to be made, a party by reason of
his or her service in that capacity. Maryland law permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others,
against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which
they may be made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that:
•the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was
the result of active and deliberate dishonesty;
•the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or
•in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.
However, under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or
for a judgment of liability on the basis of that personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification and
then only for expenses. In addition, Maryland law permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the
corporation's receipt of:
•a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification by the corporation; and
•a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined
that the standard of conduct was not met.
We have adopted an indemnification policy applicable to our officers and directors. The indemnification policy requires, among other things, that
we indemnify our (or any predecessor company's) officers and directors, to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law, against all reasonable
costs, charges, and expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, penalties, fines, and settlements (if such settlement is approved in advance by
us) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense and/or settlement of any threatened, pending, or completed suit, action, or
proceeding, and to advance to such officers and directors all related reasonable costs, charges and expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by
them in connection therewith, subject to reimbursement if it is subsequently determined that indemnification is not permitted. We must also
advance all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by our officers and directors seeking to enforce their rights to advancement under the
indemnification policy and may cover officers and directors under our directors and officers liability insurance. Although the indemnification policy
offers substantially the same scope of coverage afforded by provisions in our charter and bylaws, it provides greater assurance to officers and
directors that indemnification will be available, because it cannot be modified unilaterally in the future by our board of directors or by the
stockholders to eliminate the rights that it provides with respect to existing facts.
131
Table of Contents
Insofar as the foregoing provisions permit indemnification of directors, executive officers or persons controlling us for liability arising under the
Securities Act, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities
Act and is therefore unenforceable.
Meetings of Stockholders
Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the Chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer,
our President and, in the case of a stockholder requested special meeting, must be called by our Corporate Secretary upon the written request of
(and satisfaction of certain procedural and information requirements by) the stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast on any matter that may be properly considered at such meeting. Only matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be
considered and acted upon at such a meeting.
Annual meetings of stockholders for the election of directors and any other business that may be considered and acted upon shall be held on a
date and at a time set by our board of directors or, in the absence of such a determination on the second Monday in the month of May at 2:00 p.m.
Eastern Time, if a business day.
Interested Director and Officer Transactions
Pursuant to the MGCL, a contract or other transaction between us and a director or between us and any other corporation or other entity in which
any of our directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of such common directorship or
interest, the presence of such director at the meeting at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified or the counting of the
director's vote in favor thereof, if:
•the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our board of directors or a committee of our board, and our board or
committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction or contract by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the
disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum;
•the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to the W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the transaction
or contract is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote other than the votes of shares
owned of record or beneficially by the interested director or corporation or other entity; or
•the transaction or contract is fair and reasonable to us.
W. P. Carey requires that all contracts and transactions between W. P. Carey (including its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any of W. P. Carey's
directors or executive officers or any entity in which such director or executive officer is a director or has a material financial interest, on the other
hand, must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even if less than a quorum.
Advance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business

board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by W. P. Carey Stockholders may be made only:

nor earlier than the 150th day, prior to the anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the prior year's annual meeting of W. P. Carey
Stockholders (for purposes of our 2023 annual meeting, to be timely, such notice must be delivered by a W. P. Carey Stockholder not earlier than
November 2, 2022, the 150th day prior to the anniversary date of mailing of the notice for our 2022 annual meeting of W. P. Carey Stockholders, and

Proxy Access
In March 2017, the board of directors of W. P. Carey amended the W. P. Carey Bylaws to allow for proxy access for W. P. Carey Stockholders.
W. P. Carey Stockholders' Eligibility to Nominate
The W. P. Carey Bylaws generally permit any W. P. Carey Stockholder or group of up to 20 W. P. Carey Stockholders who have maintained
continuous qualifying ownership of at least 3% or more of the outstanding W. P. Carey Common Stock for at least the previous three years to
include a specified number of director nominees in W. P. Carey's proxy materials for its annual meeting of W. P. Carey Stockholders.
Number of W. P. Carey Stockholder-Nominated Candidates
The maximum number of W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates will be equal to the greater of: (a) two candidates or (b) 20% of the directors
in office at the time of nomination. If the 20% calculation does not result in a whole number, the maximum number of W. P. Carey Stockholder-
nominated candidates would be the closest whole number below 20%. W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates that the board of directors of
W. P. Carey determines to include in the proxy materials as Board-nominated candidates will be counted against the 20% maximum.
Calculation of Qualifying Ownership
As more fully described in the W. P. Carey Bylaws, a nominating W. P. Carey Stockholder will be considered to own only the shares for which the
W. P. Carey Stockholder possesses the full voting and investment rights and the full economic interest (including the opportunity for profit and risk
of loss). Under this provision, borrowed or hedged shares do not count as ""owned"" shares. A W. P. Carey Stockholder will be deemed to ""own""
shares that have
133
Table of Contents
been loaned by or on behalf of the W. P. Carey Stockholder to another person if the W. P. Carey Stockholder has the right to recall such loaned
shares, undertakes to recall, and does recall such loaned shares prior to the record date for the annual meeting and maintains qualifying ownership
of such loaned shares through the date of the meeting.
Procedure for Selecting Candidates in the Event the Number of Nominees Exceeds 20%
If the number of W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates exceeds 20% of the directors in office, each nominating W. P. Carey Stockholder will
select one W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidate, beginning with the nominating W. P. Carey Stockholder with the largest qualifying
ownership and proceeding through the list of nominating W. P. Carey Stockholders in descending order of qualifying ownership until the permitted
number of W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates is reached.
Nominating Procedure
In order to provide adequate time to assess W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates, requests to include W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated
candidates in W. P. Carey's proxy materials must be received no earlier than 150 days and no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on the 120th day
before the anniversary of the date that W. P. Carey mailed its proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting of W. P. Carey Stockholders.
Information Required of All Nominating W. P. Carey Stockholders
As more fully described in the W. P. Carey Bylaws, each W. P. Carey Stockholder seeking to include a director nominee in W. P. Carey's proxy
materials is required to provide certain information, including:
•Proof of qualifying stock ownership as of the date of the submission and the record date for the annual meeting, and an agreement to maintain

Generally, a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly
called and at which a quorum is present will be sufficient to approve any
matter which may properly come before the meeting, unless a vote of a
greater or lesser number is required by the CPA:18 Charter, CPA:18
Bylaws, or the MGCL. The holders of a majority of the shares present (in
person or by proxy) at an annual meeting at which a quorum is present
may, without the necessity for concurrence by the board, vote to elect a

than a majority of the votes cast is required by the W. P. Carey Charter,
listing standards of the NYSE or applicable law or regulation. In
uncontested elections, directors are elected by a majority of the votes
cast with respect to such nominee by the stockholders present, in
person or by proxy, at the meeting. If, however, the number of nominees
for election to the board of directors exceeds the number of directors to
be elected at that meeting and in certain other contested elections,
directors are elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at that meeting.

notice of any special meeting called upon stockholder request will be
given within 10 days after receipt of the request and such meetings will
be held not less than 15 nor more than 60 days after delivery of notice.
For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of, or to
vote at, any meeting or for any other purpose, (i) the board of directors

Any director, or the entire board, may be removed from office at any time
but only by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors at a meeting
called for the purpose of removing the director (subject to the rights of
holders of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to remove one

holders of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to remove one
or more directors). Independent directors must nominate replacements
for vacancies among the independent directors' positions (provided that

directors). Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the
remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy
occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies.

Exculpation and Indemnification of Directors and Officers
The CPA:18 Charter limits the liability of CPA:18 - Global's directors and
officers to CPA:18 - Global and its stockholders for money damages and
requires CPA:18 - Global to indemnify and, without requiring a
preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification,
pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of
a proceeding to (i) any individual who (a) is a present or former director
or officer of CPA:18 - Global or (b) while a director or officer, and at the
request of CPA:18 - Global, serves or has served as a director, officer,
partner or trustee of such corporation, REIT, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, in each case who is
made (or threatened to be made a party) to the proceeding by reason of
his or her service in that capacity, or (ii) CPA:18 - Global's advisor of any
of its affiliates acting as an agent of CPA:18 - Global.
The CPA:18 Charter provides that CPA:18 - Global may indemnify a
director, its advisor or any affiliate of the advisor for any loss or liability
suffered by such indemnitee, or hold harmless a director, its advisor or
any affiliate of the advisor for any loss or liability by CPA:18 - Global,
only if: (w) the director, advisor or advisor's affiliate has determined, in
good faith, that the course of conduct which caused the loss or liability
was in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global, (x) the director, advisor or
advisor's affiliate was acting on behalf of or performing services for
CPA:18 - Global, (y) such liability or loss was not the result of
negligence or misconduct (or of gross negligence or willful misconduct,
in the case of an independent director), and (z) such agreement to hold
harmless is recoverable only out of the net assets of CPA:18 - Global and
not from its stockholders.
The W. P. Carey Charter contains a provision that limits the liability of its
directors and officers to W. P. Carey and its stockholders for money
damages to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of the State of
Maryland. W. P. Carey must indemnify (to the maximum extent permitted
by Maryland law), and pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance
of the final disposition of a proceeding to, any individual who is a
present or former director or officer of W. P. Carey or a predecessor of W.
P. Carey from and against any claim or liability to which such person may
become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her
service in such capacity as a director or officer. W. P. Carey may
indemnify, if and to the extent authorized and determined to be
appropriate, by the vote of a majority of the board of directors, by the
vote of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of
all the votes entitled to be cast thereon or by special legal counsel
appointed by the board of directors, in accordance with applicable law,
any person permitted, but not required to be indemnified under
Maryland law, by W. P. Carey or a predecessor of W. P. Carey.
W. P. Carey has adopted an indemnification policy applicable to its
officers and directors. The indemnification policy requires, among other
things, that W. P. Carey indemnify its (or any predecessor company's)
officers and directors, to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law,
against all reasonable costs, charges, and expenses (including attorney's
fees), judgments, penalties, fines, and settlements (if such settlement is
approved in advance by W. P. Carey) actually and
Additionally, CPA:18 - Global may not provide indemnification for any
loss, liability or expense arising from or out of an alleged violation of
federal or state securities laws by a directors, its advisor or any affiliate
of its advisor unless: (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the
merits of each count involving alleged material securities law violations
as to such indemnitee, (2) such claims have been dismissed with
prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to such
indemnitee; or (3) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a
settlement of the claims against such indemnitee and finds that
indemnification of the settlement and the related costs should be made,
and the court considering the request for indemnification has been
advised of the position of the SEC and of the published position of any
state securities regulatory authority in which securities of CPA:18 -
Global were offered or sold as to indemnification for violations of
securities laws.
reasonably incurred in connection with the defense and/or settlement of
any threatened, pending, or completed suit, action, or proceeding, and to
advance to such officers and directors all related reasonable costs,
charges and expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by them in
connection therewith, subject to reimbursement if it is subsequently
determined that indemnification is not permitted. W. P. Carey must also
advance all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by its
officers and directors seeking to enforce their rights to advancement
under the indemnification policy and may cover officers and directors
under its directors and officers liability insurance. Although the
indemnification policy offers substantially the same scope of coverage
afforded by provisions in W. P. Carey's charter and bylaws, it provides
greater assurance to officers and directors that indemnification will be
available, because it cannot be modified unilaterally in the future by its
board of directors or by the stockholders to eliminate the rights that it
provides with respect to existing facts.

CPA:18 - Global with written affirmation of a good faith belief of having
met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification, (C) the legal
proceeding is initiated by a third party who is not a stockholder or, if by
a stockholder acting in such capacity, a court of competent jurisdiction

independent director. Pursuant to the agreements and subject to the
foregoing limitations in the CPA:18 Charter, the independent directors

is established by clear and convincing evidence that (i) the act or
omission of the independent director was material to the matter giving
rise to the proceeding and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was the
result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the independent director
actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or

Maryland Business Combination Act
CPA:18 - Global has not opted out of the business combination
provisions of the MGCL.
Pursuant to the statute, the board of directors of W. P. Carey, by
resolution, has exempted any business combinations between W. P.
Carey and any person who is an existing, or becomes in the future an,
""interested stockholder."" Consequently, the five-year prohibition and
the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business
combinations between W. P. Carey and any such person. Additionally,
this resolution may be altered, revoked or repealed in whole or in part at
any time and W. P. Carey may opt back into the business combination
provisions of the MGCL.
Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act
The CPA:18 - Global Bylaws contain a provision exempting from the
control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person
of CPA:18 - Global stock and, consequently, the control share
acquisition statute will not apply to CPA:18 - Global unless the board of
directors of CPA:18 - Global later amends the CPA:18 - Global Bylaws to
modify or eliminate this provision, which it may do without CPA:18 -
Global Stockholder approval, and which it may make effective

approval.
The board of directors of W. P. Carey resolved to opt out of the
provision of the Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act that, absent such
resolution, would have permitted the board of directors of W. P. Carey to

The following is a summary of the material federal income tax considerations of the Merger and holding of W. P. Carey Common Stock. The law firm
of DLA Piper LLP (US) has acted as counsel and reviewed this summary. For purposes of this section under the heading ""Material Federal Income
Tax Considerations,"" references to ""we,"" ""our"" and ""us"" mean only W. P. Carey and not its subsidiaries or other lower-tier entities, except as
otherwise indicated. This summary is based upon the Code, the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Treasury, rulings and other
administrative pronouncements issued by the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to differing
interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not
sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. We have not sought and do not currently expect to seek an advance
ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary is also based upon the assumption that we
will operate W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities in accordance with their applicable organizational documents. This summary is for
general information only and does not purport to discuss all aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light
of its investment or tax circumstances or to investors subject to special tax rules, such as:
•financial institutions;
•insurance companies;
•broker-dealers;
•regulated investment companies;
•partnerships and trusts;
•persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
•persons who hold our stock on behalf of other persons as nominees;
•persons who receive our stock through the exercise of employee stock options (if we ever have employees) or otherwise as compensation;
•persons holding our stock as part of a ""straddle,"" ""hedge,"" ""conversion transaction,"" ""constructive ownership transaction,"" ""synthetic security""
or other integrated investment;
•""S"" corporations; and, except to the extent discussed below:
•tax-exempt organizations; and
•foreign investors.
This summary assumes that investors will hold their shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock as a capital asset, which generally means as property held
for investment.
The federal income tax treatment of the Merger and holding of W. P. Carey Common Stock depends in some instances on determinations of fact and
interpretations of complex provisions of federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, the tax
consequences to any particular stockholder of the Merger and holding our common stock will depend on the stockholder's particular tax
circumstances. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the federal, state, and local and foreign income and other tax consequences to
you in light of your particular investment or tax circumstances of the Merger and of acquiring, holding, exchanging, or otherwise disposing of our

At the closing of the Merger, Clifford Chance US LLP, tax counsel to CPA:18 - Global and DLA Piper LLP (US), tax counsel to W. P. Carey, will each
deliver an opinion substantially to the effect that the Merger will be
147
Table of Contents
treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code. In accordance with this treatment, no gain or loss will be recognized
by W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global or their stockholders as a result of the Merger except to the extent of cash received as consideration in the Merger.
In addition, at the closing of the Merger, Clifford Chance US LLP will deliver an opinion that commencing with its taxable year ended December 31,
2018, through the closing of the Merger, CPA:18 - Global has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code. For purposes of such opinion, which will be in a form customary for transactions of this nature, Clifford Chance
US LLP may rely on customary assumptions and representations of CPA:18 - Global reasonably acceptable to W. P. Carey.
It must be emphasized that the opinions of Clifford Chance US LLP and DLA Piper LLP (US) will be based on various assumptions relating to the
organization and operation of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub, including that all factual representations and statements set forth in all
relevant documents, records and instruments are true and correct, all actions described in this proxy statement/prospectus are completed in a timely
fashion and that CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub, have at all times operated in accordance with the method of operation described in
their organizational documents and this proxy statement/prospectus. Additionally, the opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP regarding the REIT
qualification of CPA:18 - Global will be conditioned upon factual representations and covenants made by the management of CPA:18 - Global and
affiliated entities regarding the organization, assets, conduct of business operations of CPA:18 - Global and other items regarding CPA:18 - Global's
ability to have met the various requirements for qualification as a REIT, and assumes that such representations and covenants are accurate and
complete and that CPA:18 - Global has taken no action inconsistent with its qualification as a REIT. While CPA:18 - Global believes that it is
organized and has operated so that it has qualified as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing
importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in circumstances or applicable law, no assurance can be given by Clifford
Chance US LLP or CPA:18 - Global that it has so qualified for any particular year. Clifford Chance US LLP will have no obligation to advise CPA:18 -
Global or the holders of CPA:18 Common Stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed or of any subsequent
change in the applicable law. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, that no ruling has been or will be sought
from the IRS on the tax consequences of the Merger or the REIT qualification of CPA:18 - Global, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will
not take, or that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the federal income tax consequences set forth below.
In addition, the opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP regarding the REIT qualification of CPA:18 - Global will be conditioned on the assumption that
seven non-U.S. subsidiaries of CPA:18 - Global will be granted by the IRS an extension of time to file, and will properly and timely file, elections to
be treated as partnerships or entities disregarded from their owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, effective shortly after their acquisition by
CPA:18 - Global. These entities default to being treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but CPA:18 - Global can elect to treat
these entities as partnerships or entities disregarded from their owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which we refer to as flow-through
entities. CPA:18 - Global intended to elect to treat each of these entities as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the time that
the entities were acquired but inadvertently failed to make such elections. CPA:18 - Global has requested an extension of time from the IRS,
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-3, to timely elect to treat these entities as flow-through entities effective shortly after the
acquisition of the entities by CPA:18 - Global. CPA:18 - Global believes that it meets the requirements to be granted such extensions and that
therefore CPA:18 - Global will be able to treat these subsidiaries as flow-through entities in prior years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the IRS may
disagree with CPA:18 - Global's position and decide not to grant the extension, which would adversely impact the conclusion of Clifford Chance US
LLP's opinion that CPA:18 - Global has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Code.
If the IRS does not grant the extension of time to file these elections, then these subsidiaries would be treated as non-U.S. corporations during
certain prior periods. Because interests in non-U.S. corporations are not qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests, CPA:18 - Global's
ownership of such subsidiaries would cause CPA:18 - Global to fail to satisfy certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs during such prior
periods. In that event, CPA:18 - Global would either fail to qualify as a REIT beginning with such prior periods, in which case CPA:18 - Global would
be liable for substantial corporate income taxes for such prior periods, or if CPA:18 - Global were able to
148
Table of Contents
establish that it acted with reasonable cause and not willful neglect, CPA:18 - Global could maintain its REIT qualification but would be required to
pay a penalty tax with respect to such failures, which could be material in amount. Prior to the Merger, any such taxes would be liabilities of CPA:18
- Global. Moreover, to the extent that CPA:18 - Global is liable for such penalty taxes, or if CPA:18 - Global fails to qualify as a REIT, following the
Merger, the liability for any such penalty taxes or any corporate income taxes owed by CPA:18 - Global as a result of its failure to qualify as a REIT
would generally become liabilities of W. P. Carey. The remainder of the discussion in this proxy statement / prospectus, unless otherwise noted,
assumes that the IRS will grant such extensions and the seven subsidiaries will be treated as flow-through entities for the relevant prior periods.
Based on the foregoing opinions of counsel as to the tax treatment of the Merger, the material federal income tax consequences to CPA:18
Stockholders will be as follows:
•except as discussed below under ""Cash Consideration,"" no gain or loss will be recognized by CPA:18 Stockholders on the exchange of CPA:18
Common Stock for W. P. Carey Common Stock pursuant to the Merger;
•the aggregate basis of the W. P. Carey Common Stock received by a CPA:18 Stockholder in the Merger (including fractional shares of W. P. Carey
Common Stock deemed received and exchanged for cash as described below) will equal the aggregate basis of the CPA:18 Common Stock for which
it is exchanged, decreased by the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) by such
CPA:18 Stockholder and increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized by such CPA:18 Stockholder (calculated as described below under ""-
Cash Consideration""); and
•the holding period of W. P. Carey Common Stock received in exchange for shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (including fractional shares of W. P.
Carey Common Stock deemed received and exchanged for cash as described below) will include the holding period of the CPA:18 Common Stock
for which it is exchanged.
If a CPA:18 Stockholder acquired different blocks of CPA:18 Common Stock at different times or at different prices, such U.S. holder's holding
period and basis will be determined separately with respect to each block of CPA:18 Common Stock.
Cash Consideration. A CPA:18 Stockholder’s receipt of cash in exchange for its CPA:18 Common Stock in the Merger will generally result in such
CPA:18 Stockholder recognizing gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the amount of cash
(excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) received by such CPA:18 Stockholder and the fair market
value of the W. P. Carey Common Stock (including the fair market value of any fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) received by such
CPA:18 Stockholder, over (b) such CPA:18 Stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares CPA:18 Common Stock exchanged by such CPA:18
Stockholder in the Merger, or (ii) the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) received by
such CPA:18 Stockholder. In addition, a CPA:18 Stockholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock in the
Merger will be treated as having received the fractional share pursuant to the Merger and then as having exchanged the fractional share for cash.
As a result, such holder of CPA:18 Common Stock will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received
and the basis in such holder's fractional share interest as set forth above.
Any gain or loss recognized by a CPA: 18 Stockholder due to its receipt of cash in the Merger will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-
term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the Merger, the CPA:18 Stockholder's holding period for the relevant shares is greater than one
year. For CPA:18 Stockholders that are non-corporate holders, long-term capital gain generally will be taxed at a federal income tax rate that is lower
than the rate for ordinary income or for short-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
If any cash is paid to a CPA:18 Stockholder that is a ""non-U.S. holder"" (as defined below under ""- Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders""), W. P. Carey will
withhold from such payment a 15% U.S. FIRPTA withholding tax unless the non-U.S. holder is able to establish that the payment is exempt from, or
otherwise not subject to, such withholding.
149
Table of Contents
The non-U.S. holder may seek a refund from the IRS of amounts withheld if it files a proper return establishing that the amount withheld exceeds the
amount of U.S. income tax imposed on the transaction.
As a result of the Merger, CPA:18 - Global will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements in the U.S. Department of Treasury
Regulations, which will require reporting certain facts regarding the Merger.
Taxation of W. P. Carey
We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We believe that we have been organized and
operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT.
The law firm of DLA Piper LLP (US) is acting as our tax counsel in connection with this offering. At the closing of the Merger and in connection
with this offering, DLA Piper LLP (US) will render an opinion that, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018, we have been
organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our current and proposed method of
operation as described in the proxy statement/prospectus and Form S-4 will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT. It must be emphasized that the opinion of DLA Piper LLP (US) will be based on various assumptions relating to our organization and
operation and conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our organization, assets, and
income, and the future conduct of our business operations. While we believe that we have been organized and operated and intend to continue to
operate so that we qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual
determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given by DLA Piper LLP (US) or by us that we will
qualify as a REIT for any particular year. The opinion of DLA Piper LLP (US) will be expressed as of the date issued. DLA Piper LLP (US) has no
obligation to advise us or the W. P. Carey Stockholders of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any
subsequent change in the applicable law. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given
that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions.
Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, distribution levels, and
diversity of stock and asset ownership, various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code, the compliance with which will not be
reviewed by DLA Piper LLP (US). Our ability to qualify as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests, some of which depend upon the
fair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly. Such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as
a REIT.
Taxation of REITs in General
As indicated above, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various qualification
requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code. The material qualification requirements are summarized below under ""- Requirements for REIT
Qualification - General."" While we intend to operate so that we qualify as a REIT, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge our
qualification, or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the REIT requirements in the future. See ""- Failure to Qualify"" for any potential
tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a REIT.
Provided that we qualify as a REIT, generally we will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and will not be subject to U.S. federal
corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to the W. P. Carey Stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the
""double taxation"" at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation. In general, the income that we
generate and distribute currently is taxed only at the stockholder level upon a distribution of dividends to the W. P. Carey Stockholders.
Most domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates are taxed on corporate dividends at preferential rates. With limited exceptions,
however, dividends from us or from other entities that are taxed as REITs are generally not eligible for the preferential rates and will be taxed at rates
applicable to ordinary income (subject to the
150
Table of Contents
applicability of certain deductions as discussed in ""Taxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders - Distributions""). See ""Taxation of Stockholders -
Taxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders - Distributions.""
Net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes of REITs generally do not pass through to the W. P. Carey Stockholders. See
""Taxation of Stockholders.""
If we qualify as a REIT, we will nonetheless be subject to U.S. federal tax in the following circumstances:
•We will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed ""real estate investment trust taxable income,"" including undistributed net capital
gains.
•If we have net income from prohibited transactions, which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for
sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property, such income will be subject to a 100% tax. See "" - Prohibited
Transactions"" below.
•If we have (1) net income from the sale or other disposition of ""foreclosure property"" held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
business or (2) other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be required to pay tax at the highest corporate rate on this income. To
the extent that income from foreclosure property is otherwise qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, this tax is not
applicable. Subject to certain other requirements, foreclosure property generally is defined as property we acquired through foreclosure or after a
default on a loan secured by the property or a lease of the property. See ""- Foreclosure Property"" below.
•We may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain. In that case, a stockholder would include its proportionate share of our
undistributed net capital gain (to the extent we make a timely designation of such gain to the stockholder) in its income, would be deemed to have
paid the tax that we paid on such gain, and would be allowed a credit or refund for its proportionate share of the tax deemed to have been paid and
an adjustment would be made to increase the basis of the stockholder's basis in our stock.
•If we should fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, as discussed below, but nonetheless maintain our qualification
as a REIT because we satisfy other requirements, we will be required to pay a tax equal to (1) the greater of (A) the amount by which we fail to
satisfy the 75% gross income test and (B) the amount by which we fail to satisfy the 95% gross income test, multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to
reflect our profitability.
•If we should fail to satisfy the asset tests (other than certain de minimis failures) or other requirements applicable to REITs, as described below, and
yet maintain our qualification as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met, we may be
subject to an excise tax. In that case, the amount of the excise tax will be at least $50,000 per failure, and, in the case of certain asset test failures, will
be determined as the amount of net income generated by the assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate (currently 21%) if that
amount exceeds $50,000 per failure.
•If we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (a) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (b) 95% of our REIT
capital gain net income for such year, and (c) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a nondeductible 4%
excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of (i) the amounts that we actually distributed and (ii) the amounts we retained and
upon which we paid income tax at the corporate level.
•We may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record keeping requirements
intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a REIT's stockholders, as described below in ""- Requirements for
Qualification - General.""
•If we fail to comply with the requirement to send annual letters to the W. P. Carey Stockholders requesting information regarding the actual
ownership of our stock, and the failure is not due to reasonable cause or due to willful neglect, we will be subject to a $25,000 penalty, or if the
failure is intentional, a $50,000 penalty.
151
Table of Contents
•A 100% tax may be imposed on transactions between us and a ""taxable REIT subsidiary"" (""TRS"") (as described below) that do not reflect arms-
length terms.
•If we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., a corporation taxable under subchapter C of the Code) in a transaction
in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the
subchapter C corporation, we may be subject to tax on such built-in gain (determined as of the date on which we acquired the assets) at the highest
corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the five-year period
following their acquisition from the subchapter C corporation. The results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of gain
assume that the C corporation will refrain from making an election to recognize gain with respect to the disposition of the assets under the
applicable U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations on its tax return for the year in which we acquire the asset from the C corporation. The IRS has
issued final U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations that exclude from the application of this built-in gains tax any gain from the sale of property
we acquired in an exchange under Section 1031 (a like kind exchange) or 1033 (an involuntary conversion) of the Code.
•Our subsidiaries that are C corporations, including our TRS, generally will be required to pay federal corporate income tax on their earnings.
In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, franchise,
property and other taxes on our assets and operations. We could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently
contemplated.
Requirements for REIT Qualification - General
The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:
(1)that is managed by one or more trustees or directors;
(2)the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;
(3)that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for Sections 856-860 of the Code;
(4)that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the Code;
(5)the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons;
(6)in which, during the last half of each taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock is owned, actually or constructively, by
five or fewer ""individuals"" (including certain specified tax-exempt entities); and
(7)which meets other tests described below, including with respect to the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions.
The Code provides that conditions (1) through (4) must be met during the entire taxable year, and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335
days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Conditions (5) and (6) need not be met during a
corporation's initial tax year as a REIT. For purposes of condition (6), the term ""individual"" includes a supplemental unemployment compensation
benefit plan, a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes, but generally does not
include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust.
We believe that we have been organized, have operated and have issued sufficient shares of capital stock with sufficient diversity of ownership to
allow us to satisfy conditions (1) through (7) inclusive, during the relevant time periods. In addition, the W. P. Carey Charter provides restrictions
regarding the ownership and transfers of our shares, which are intended to assist us in satisfying the share ownership requirements described in
conditions (5) and
152
Table of Contents
(6) above. These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in
conditions (5) and (6) above. If we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements, except as provided in the next two sentences, our
qualification as a REIT will terminate. If, however, we comply with the rules contained in applicable U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations that
require us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know, or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable
diligence, that we failed to meet the requirement described in condition (6) above, we will be treated as having met this requirement. Moreover, if our
failure to satisfy the share ownership requirements is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, we may retain our REIT qualification but will
be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. See ""- Failure to Qualify.""
To monitor compliance with the share ownership requirements, we generally are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our
shares. To do so, we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock pursuant to which
the record holders must disclose the actual owners of the shares (i.e., the persons required to include our dividends in their gross income). We must
maintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records. We could be subject to monetary penalties if
we fail to comply with these record-keeping requirements. If you fail or refuse to comply with the demands, you will be required by U.S. Department
of Treasury Regulations to submit a statement with your tax return disclosing your actual ownership of our shares and other information.
In addition, a corporation generally may not elect to become a REIT unless its taxable year is the calendar year. We have adopted December 31 as
our year-end, and thereby have satisfied and will continue to satisfy this requirement.
The Code provides relief from violations of certain of the REIT requirements, in cases where a violation is due to reasonable cause and not to willful
neglect, and other requirements are met, including, in certain cases, the payment of a penalty tax that is based upon the magnitude of the violation.
See ""- Income Tests"" and ""- Asset Tests"" below. If we fail to satisfy any of the various REIT requirements, there can be no assurance that these
relief provisions would be available to enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and, if such relief provisions are available, the amount of
any resultant penalty tax could be substantial.
Subsidiary Entities
Ownership of partnership interests
If we are a partner in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (references herein to ""partnership"" include limited
liability companies that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations provide that
we are deemed to own our proportionate share of the partnership's assets based on our interest in partnership capital (subject to special rules
relating to the 10% asset test described below), and to earn our proportionate share of the partnership's income, for purposes of the asset and
gross income tests applicable to REITs. In addition, the assets and gross income of the partnership are deemed to retain the same character in our
hands. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any of our subsidiary partnerships will be treated as our assets and items
of income for purposes of applying the REIT requirements. If we become a limited partner (or member) in any partnership or limited liability
company taxed as a partnership and such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT or require us to
pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership or limited liability company taxed as a
partnership could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in
time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In that case, we could
fail to qualify as a REIT unless we were entitled to relief, as described below.
Pursuant to applicable partnership audit rules, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any
partner's distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto are generally assessed and collected at the
partnership level regardless of changes in composition of the partners (or their relative ownership) between the year under audit and the year of the
adjustment. The partnership audit rules also include an elective alternative method under which the additional taxes resulting from
153
Table of Contents
the adjustment are assessed from the affected partners, subject to a higher rate of interest than otherwise would apply. The partnership audit rules
could result in a partnership in which we own an interest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit
adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and
penalties even though we, as a REIT, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit
adjustment.
Disregarded subsidiaries
If we own a corporate subsidiary that is a ""qualified REIT subsidiary"" (a ""QRS""), that subsidiary is generally disregarded for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and all of the subsidiary's assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit are treated as our assets, liabilities and items of
income, deduction and credit, including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to REITs. A QRS is any corporation, other than
a TRS, that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by a REIT. A QRS is not required to pay federal income tax, and our ownership of the stock of a
QRS does not violate the restrictions on ownership of securities, as described below under ""- Asset Tests."" Other entities that are wholly owned by
us, including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for federal income tax purposes, are also
generally disregarded as separate entities for federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of the REIT gross income and asset tests.
Disregarded subsidiaries, along with any partnerships in which the W. P. Carey may hold an equity interest, are sometimes referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as ""pass-through subsidiaries.""
We currently hold substantially all of our real estate assets through a series of pass-through subsidiaries, primarily through limited liability
companies that we believe will be treated as disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes. In the future, we may hold investments through
entities treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
In the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be wholly owned - for example, if any equity interest in the subsidiary is acquired by a
person other than us or another disregarded subsidiary of ours - the subsidiary's separate existence would no longer be disregarded for federal
income tax purposes. Instead, the subsidiary would have multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation.
Such an event could, depending on the circumstances, adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income requirements
applicable to REITs, including the requirement that REITs generally may not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the securities of another
corporation. See "" - Asset Tests"" and "" - Income Tests.""
Foreign Assets and Subsidiaries
With respect to any foreign properties, we have maintained, and will continue to maintain, appropriate books and records for our foreign properties
in local currencies. Accordingly, for federal income tax purposes, including the 75% and 95% gross income tests summarized herein, our income,
gains and losses from our foreign operations that are not held in TRSs will generally be calculated first in the applicable local currency, and then
translated into United States dollars at appropriate exchange rates. On the periodic repatriation of monies from such foreign operations to the
United States, we will be required to recognize foreign exchange gains or losses; however, any foreign exchange gains we recognize from
repatriation are expected to constitute ""real estate foreign exchange gains"" under Section 856(n)(2) of the Code, and will thus be excluded from the
75% and 95% gross income tests summarized below.
In addition, we own interests in entities that are both TRSs and ""controlled foreign corporations"" for federal income tax purposes, and we are
deemed to receive our allocable share of certain income, referred to as Subpart F Income, earned by such controlled foreign corporations whether or
not that income is actually distributed to us. Numerous exceptions apply in determining whether an item of income is Subpart F Income, including
exceptions for rent received from an unrelated person and derived in the active conduct of a trade or business. Rents from real property are
generally treated as earned in an active trade or business if the landlord/licensor regularly performs active and substantial management and
operational functions with respect to the property while it is leased, but only if such activities are performed through the landlord/licensor's own
officers or staff of employees. We believe our controlled foreign corporations generally do not satisfy this active rental exception however, and as a
result we may
154
Table of Contents
recognize material amounts of Subpart F Income. Further, beginning with our 2018 taxable year we must include in gross income the ""global
intangible low-taxed income"" in respect of our CFCs. Based on advice of counsel, we believe that our ""global intangible low-taxed income"" and any
Subpart F Income we recognize qualifies under the 95% gross income test. However, we do not believe our ""global intangible low-taxed income"" or
our Subpart F income qualifies under the 75% gross income test.
REIT subsidiaries
Some of our subsidiaries may also be taxable as REITs. Provided such entities qualify as REITs under the Code, our equity in such entities will be a
qualifying REIT asset under the quarterly REIT asset tests described below, and any dividends and/or gain on disposition of such equity will be
qualifying REIT gross income under both the 75% and 95% gross income tests discussed below.
Taxable REIT subsidiaries
We will jointly elect with certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiary corporations, whether or not wholly owned, to treat such subsidiary
corporations as TRSs. We generally may not own more than 10% of the securities of a taxable corporation, as measured by voting power or value,
unless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation as a TRS. The separate existence of a TRS or other taxable corporation is not
ignored for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a TRS or other taxable corporation generally would be subject to corporate income tax on its
earnings, which may reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate, and may reduce our ability to make distributions
to the W. P. Carey Stockholders.
We are not generally treated as holding the assets of a TRS or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary
earns. Rather, the stock issued by a taxable subsidiary to us is an asset in our hands, and we treat the distributions paid to us from such taxable
subsidiary, if any, as income, gain, or return of capital, as applicable. This treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations, as described
below. Because we do not generally include the assets and income of TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations in determining our compliance
with the REIT requirements, we will use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the REIT rules might otherwise preclude us from doing
directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. For example, we may use TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations to conduct activities that
give rise to certain categories of income such as management fees or activities that would be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions.
Income Tests
In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each
taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in ""prohibited transactions"" and certain hedging and foreign
currency transactions, generally must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including interest income
derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed securities), ""rents from real property,""
distributions received from other REITs, and gains from the sale of real estate assets (including REIT shares), as well as specified income from
temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions and
certain hedging transactions, must be derived from some combination of such income from investments in real property (i.e., generally income that
qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above), as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or
securities, which need not have any relation to real property.
We and our subsidiaries may hold investments in and pay taxes to foreign countries. Taxes that we pay in foreign jurisdictions may not be passed
through to, or used by, the W. P. Carey Stockholders as a foreign tax credit or otherwise. Our foreign investments might also generate foreign
currency gains and losses. For purposes of either one or both of the 75% and 95% gross income tests, two categories of foreign currency gain may
be excluded from gross income: ""real estate foreign exchange gain"" and ""passive foreign exchange gain."" Real estate foreign exchange gain is not
treated as gross income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. Real estate foreign exchange gain includes gain derived from
certain qualified business units of the REIT and foreign currency gain attributable to (i) qualifying income under the 75% gross income test, (ii) the
acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property, or (iii) being an obligor on an obligation
secured
155
Table of Contents
by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property. In addition, passive foreign exchange gain is not treated as gross income for
purposes of the 95% gross income test only. Passive foreign exchange gain includes real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain
attributable to (i) qualifying income under the 95% gross income test, (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations, or (iii) being the obligor on
obligations and that, in the case of (ii) and (iii), does not fall within the scope of the real estate foreign exchange definition. In all cases, we intend
that any foreign currency transactions will be structured in a manner that will not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. No assurance can be given
that any foreign currency gains that we recognize directly or through pass-through subsidiaries will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy the
REIT qualification requirements.
Interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test to the extent that the obligation upon which
such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property or on interests in real property. If we receive interest income with respect to a
mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property, and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable
year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan, the interest income will be
apportioned between the real property and the other collateral, and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the 75% gross
income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property, provided that an obligation secured in part by a mortgage on
personal property is treated as secured solely by real property for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of the personal
property does not exceed 15% of the total of the fair market value of the real and personal property. Even if a loan is not secured by real property, or
is undersecured, the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the 95% gross income test.
To the extent that the terms of a loan provide for contingent interest that is based on the cash proceeds realized upon the sale of the property
securing the loan (a ""shared appreciation provision""), income attributable to the participation feature will be treated as gain from sale of the
underlying property, which generally will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests provided that the real
property is not held as inventory or dealer property or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. To the extent that we
derive interest income from a mortgage loan or income from the rental of real property (discussed below) where all or a portion of the amount of
interest or rental income payable is contingent, such income generally will qualify for purposes of the gross income tests only if it is based upon
the gross receipts or sales and not on the net income or profits of the borrower or lessee. This limitation does not apply, however, where the
borrower or lessee leases substantially all of its interest in the property to tenants or subtenants to the extent that the rental income derived by the
borrower or lessee, as the case may be, would qualify as rents from real property had we earned the income directly.
Rents received by us will qualify as ""rents from real property"" in satisfying the gross income requirements described above only if several
conditions are met. If rent is partly attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property, the portion of the rent that is
attributable to the personal property will not qualify as ""rents from real property"" unless it constitutes 15% or less of the total rent received under
the lease. In addition, the amount of rent generally must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. Amounts received
as rent, however, generally will not be excluded from rents from real property solely by reason of being based on fixed percentages of gross receipts
or sales. Moreover, for rents received to qualify as ""rents from real property,"" we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or
render services to the tenants of such property, other than through an ""independent contractor"" from which we derive no revenue and that meets
certain other requirements or through a TRS. We are permitted, however, to perform services that are ""usually or customarily rendered"" in
connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and which are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property. In
addition, we may directly or indirectly provide noncustomary services to tenants of our properties without disqualifying all of the rent from the
property if the income from such services does not exceed 1% of the total gross income from the property. For purposes of this test, we are deemed
to have received income from such non-customary services in an amount at least 150% of the direct cost of providing the services. Moreover, we
are generally permitted to provide services to tenants or others through a TRS without disqualifying the rental income received from tenants for
purposes of the income tests. Also, rental income will qualify as rents from real property only to the extent that we do not directly or constructively
hold a 10% or greater interest, as measured by vote or value, in the lessee's equity.
156
Table of Contents
We may directly or indirectly receive distributions from TRSs or other corporations that are not REITs or QRSs. These distributions generally are
treated as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation. Such dividends will generally constitute
qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any dividends that we receive
from a REIT, however, will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 95% and 75% gross income tests.
If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may still qualify as a REIT for such year if we are
entitled to relief under applicable provisions of the Code. These relief provisions will be generally available if (1) our failure to meet these tests was
due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and (2) following our identification of the failure to meet the 75% or 95% gross income test
for any taxable year, we file a schedule with the IRS setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test
for such taxable year in accordance with U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the
benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances. If these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances, we will not
qualify as a REIT. As discussed above under "" - Taxation of REITs in General,"" even where these relief provisions apply, the Code imposes a tax
based upon the amount by which we fail to satisfy the particular gross income test.
Asset Tests
At the close of each calendar quarter, we must also satisfy certain tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our
total assets must be represented by some combination of ""real estate assets,"" cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, and, under some
circumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, real estate assets include interests in real property and
interests in mortgages on real property or interest in real property, such as land, buildings, leasehold interests in real property, stock of other
corporations that qualify as REITs, for taxable years after December 31, 2015, debt instruments issued by REITs which are required to file annual
and periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act (""publicly offered REITs"") subject to certain limitations, and some kinds of mortgage-
backed securities and mortgage loans. Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% test are subject to the additional asset tests described
below.
Second, the value of any one issuer's ""securities"" (defined to exclude ""real estate assets"") that we own (other than a TRS or QRS) may not exceed
5% of the value of our total assets.
Third, we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 10% asset tests
do not apply to securities of TRSs and QRSs and the 10% asset test by value does not apply to ""straight debt"" having specified characteristics and
to certain other securities described below. Solely for purposes of the 10% asset test by value, the determination of our interest in the assets of a
partnership in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership, excluding for this
purpose certain securities described in the Code, as well as our equity interest in the partnership, if any.
Fourth, the aggregate value of all securities of TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of our total assets (25% for taxable years ending
before January 1, 2018). Fifth, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is represented by securities (other than those securities includable
as ""real estate assets."") Sixth, for taxable years after December 31, 2015, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is represented by
nonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments.
Notwithstanding the general rule, as noted above, that for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests we are treated as owning our proportionate
share of the underlying assets of a subsidiary partnership, if we hold indebtedness issued by a partnership, the indebtedness will be subject to,
and may cause a violation of, the asset tests unless the indebtedness is a qualifying mortgage asset or other conditions are met. Similarly, although
stock of another REIT is a qualifying asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, any non-mortgage debt that is issued by another REIT may not so
qualify (such debt, however, will not be treated as a ""security"" for purposes of the 10% asset test by value, as explained below).
Certain relief provisions are available to REITs to satisfy the asset requirements or to maintain REIT qualification notwithstanding certain violations
of the asset and other requirements. One such provision allows a
157
Table of Contents
REIT which fails one or more of the asset requirements to nevertheless maintain its REIT qualification if (i) the REIT provides the IRS with a
description of each asset causing the failure, (ii) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (iii) the REIT pays a tax equal to the
greater of (A) $50,000 per failure, and (B) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the highest
applicable corporate tax rate (currently 21%), and (iv) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day
of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame.
In the case of de minimis violations of the 10% and 5% asset tests, a REIT may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such requirements if
(1) the value of the assets causing the violation does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT's total assets and $10,000,000, and (2) the REIT either
disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or the relevant tests are
otherwise satisfied within that time frame.
Certain securities will not cause a violation of the 10% asset test described above. Such securities include instruments that constitute ""straight
debt."" A security does not qualify as ""straight debt"" where a REIT (or a controlled TRS of the REIT) owns other securities of the same issuer which
do not qualify as straight debt, unless the value of those other securities constitute, in the aggregate, 1% or less of the total value of that issuer's
outstanding securities. In addition to straight debt, the Code provides that certain other securities will not violate the 10% asset test. Such
securities include (1) any loan made to an individual or an estate, (2) certain rental agreements pursuant to which one or more payments are to be
made in subsequent years (other than agreements between a REIT and certain persons related to the REIT under attribution rules), (3) any
obligation to pay rents from real property, (4) securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of
(or payments made by) a non-governmental entity, (5) any security (including debt securities) issued by another REIT, and (6) any debt instrument
issued by a partnership if the partnership's income is of a nature that it would satisfy the 75% gross income test described above under "" - Income
Tests."" In applying the 10% asset test by value, a debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into account to the extent, if any, of the REIT's
proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by that partnership.
We believe that our holdings of securities and other assets comply with the foregoing REIT asset requirements, and we intend to monitor
compliance on an ongoing basis. Certain mezzanine loans we make or acquire may qualify for the safe harbor of Revenue Procedure 2003-65
pursuant to which certain loans secured by a first priority security interest in ownership interests in a partnership or limited liability company will be
treated as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% real estate asset test and the 10% vote or value test, and the income derived therefrom will
constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 95% and 75% gross income tests. See "" - Income Tests."" We may make some mezzanine loans that
do not qualify for that safe harbor, qualify as ""straight debt"" securities or qualify for one of the other exclusions from the definition of ""securities""
for purposes of the 10% value test. We intend to make such investments in such a manner as not to fail the asset or gross income tests described
above.
Some of our assets will consist of goodwill. We do not expect the value of any such goodwill to be significant, and, in any event, to negatively
impact our compliance with the REIT asset tests.
No independent appraisals will be obtained to support our conclusions as to the value of our total assets or the value of any particular security or
securities. Moreover, values of some assets, may not be susceptible to a precise determination, and values are subject to change in the future.
Furthermore, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances,
which could affect the application of the REIT asset requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our
interests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT asset tests.
If we should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if (1) we
satisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (2) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset
requirements was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of non-qualifying assets, but instead arose from changes in the market value of our
assets. If the condition described in (2) were not satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy
158
Table of Contents
within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose or by making use of relief provisions described above.
Annual Distribution Requirements
In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to the W. P. Carey Stockholders in an
amount at least equal to:
(1)the sum of
(i)90% of our ""REIT taxable income,"" computed without regard to our net capital gains and the dividends paid deduction, and
(ii)90% of our net income, if any, (after tax) from foreclosure property (as described below), minus
(2)the sum of specified items of non-cash income.
We generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file
our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. In order for dividends paid with
respect to taxable years prior to 2015, to provide a tax deduction for us for such years, the distributions must not be ""preferential dividends."" A
distribution is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is (i) pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and (ii) in
accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents. For taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to publicly offered REITs. We are a publicly offered REIT.
To the extent that we distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our ""REIT taxable income,"" as adjusted, we will be subject to tax at ordinary
corporate tax rates on the retained portion. We may elect to retain, rather than distribute, our net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains.
In this case, we could elect for the W. P. Carey Stockholders to include their proportionate shares of such undistributed long-term capital gains in
income, and to receive a corresponding credit for their share of the tax that we paid. Our stockholders would then increase their adjusted basis of
their stock by the difference between (1) the amounts of capital gain distributions that we designated and that they include in their taxable income,
and (2) the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income.
To the extent that we have available net operating losses carried forward from prior REIT tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of
distributions that we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. Such losses, however, will generally not affect the
character, in the hands of the W. P. Carey Stockholders, of any distributions that are actually made as ordinary dividends or capital gains. See "" -
Taxation of Stockholders - Taxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders - Distributions."" A REIT's deduction for any NOL carryforwards arising from
losses it sustains in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited to 80% of a REIT's taxable income (determined without regard to the
deduction for dividends paid), and any unused portion of losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 may not be carried back,
but may be carried forward indefinitely. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act) eliminates this 80%
limitation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021.
If we should fail to distribute during a calendar year at least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (2) 95% of our REIT
capital gain net income for such year, and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a non-deductible 4%
excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (i) the amounts actually distributed, and (ii) the amounts of income for the
taxable year we retained and on which we have paid corporate income tax.
It is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between (1) our
actual receipt of cash, including receipt of distributions from our subsidiaries,
159
Table of Contents
and (2) our inclusion of items in income for federal income tax purposes. Other potential sources of non-cash taxable income include:
•""residual interests"" in a real estate mortgage investment conduit or taxable mortgage pools;
•loans or mortgage-backed securities held as assets that are issued at a discount and require the accrual of taxable economic interest in advance of
receipt in cash; and
•loans on which the borrower is permitted to defer cash payments of interest, and distressed loans on which we may be required to accrue taxable
interest income even though the borrower is unable to make current servicing payments in cash.
In the event that such timing differences occur, in order to meet the distribution requirements, it might be necessary for us to arrange for short-term,
or possibly long-term, borrowings, or to pay distributions in the form of taxable in-kind distributions of stock or other property.
We may be able to rectify a failure to pay sufficient dividends for any year by paying ""deficiency dividends"" to stockholders in a later year. These
deficiency dividends may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year, but an interest charge would be imposed upon us for
the delay in distribution.
Failure to Qualify
If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification other than the gross income or asset tests, we could avoid disqualification if our
failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. Relief provisions are available for
failures of the gross income tests and asset tests, as described above in "" - Income Tests"" and "" - Asset Tests.""
If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions described above do not apply, we would be subject to tax,
including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We cannot deduct dividends to stockholders in
any year in which we do not qualify to be taxed as a REIT, nor would we be required to make distributions in such a year. In this situation, to the
extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates will generally
be taxable at qualified dividend rates. In addition, subject to the limitations of the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends
received deduction. Unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as
a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. It is not possible to state whether, in all circumstances, we
would be entitled to this statutory relief.
Sale-Leaseback Transactions
Our investments may be in the form of sale-leaseback transactions. We normally intend to treat these transactions as true leases for federal income
tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a true lease
but is more properly treated in some other manner, such as a financing arrangement or loan for federal income tax purposes. Even if our sale-
leasebacks are treated as secured loans, for purposes of the REIT asset tests and the 75% gross income test, each ""loan"" would likely be
considered to be collateralized by real property to the extent of the fair market value of the underlying property. As a result, we believe that we
would continue to meet the REIT assets tests and gross income tests. However, it is possible that if one or more of our leases were recharacterized
as a financing, the recharacterization of one or more of these transactions could cause us to fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or gross income
tests described above based upon the asset we would be treated as holding or the income we would be treated as having earned as a result of such
recharacterization, and such failure could result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if one or more of our leases were recharacterized as a
loan, tax attributes associated with the ownership of real property - principally depreciation - would not be available to us, and the timing of our
income inclusion would be affected. These changes in amount or timing of income inclusion or the loss of depreciation deductions resulting from
the recharacterization could cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement described
160
Table of Contents
above for one or more taxable years absent the availability of the deficiency dividend procedure or might result in a larger portion of our dividends
being treated as ordinary income to the W. P. Carey Stockholders.
Prohibited Transactions
Net income that we derive from a prohibited transaction is subject to a 100% tax. The term ""prohibited transaction"" generally includes a sale or
other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property, as discussed below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary
course of a trade or business. We intend to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own (or are treated as owning) will be treated as, or as
having been, held for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business.
Whether property is held ""primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business"" depends on the particular facts and
circumstances. No assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as property held for sale to customers, or that we can
comply with certain safe-harbor provisions of the Code that would prevent such treatment. The 100% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of
property that is held through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will potentially be subject to tax in the hands of the
corporation at regular corporate rates.
Foreclosure Property
Foreclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property (1) that we acquire as the result of having bid on the
property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after a default (or
upon imminent default) on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by us and secured by the property, (2) for which we acquired the related
loan or lease at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated, and (3) with respect to which we made a proper election to treat the property as
foreclosure property. We generally will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate (currently 21%) on any net income from foreclosure property,
including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property, other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of
the 75% gross income test. Any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the
100% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above, even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property. To
the extent that we receive any income from foreclosure property that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test, we intend to make
an election to treat the related property as foreclosure property.
Derivatives and Hedging Transactions
We and our subsidiaries may enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exposure on one or more of our
assets or liabilities. Hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps,
interest rate cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments. Except to the extent provided by
U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations, any income from a hedging transaction we entered into (i) in the normal course of our business primarily
to manage risk of interest rate, inflation and/or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations
incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets, which is clearly identified as specified in U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations
before the closing of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction,
(ii) primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the 75% or
95% gross income tests and (iii) for taxable years after December 31, 2015, primarily to manage risk with respect to a prior hedge entered into in
connection with property that has been disposed of or liabilities that have been extinguished, in each case which is clearly identified as such before
the closing of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross
income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-
qualifying income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not
jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. We may conduct some or all of our hedging activities through our TRS or other corporate entity, the income
from which may be subject to federal income tax, rather than by participating in the arrangements directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. No
assurance can be given, however, that our hedging activities will
161
Table of Contents
not give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of either or both of the REIT gross income tests, or that our hedging activities will not
adversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT qualification requirements.
Taxation of Stockholders
Taxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders
Definitions - In this section, the phrase ""domestic stockholder"" means a holder of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock that for federal income tax
purposes is:
•a citizen or resident of the United States;
•a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States
or of any political subdivision thereof;
•an estate, the income of which is subject to federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•a trust, if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.
If a partnership, including for this purpose any entity that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, holds shares of W. P. Carey
Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. An investor that is a partnership and the partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors about the federal income tax
consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock.
Distributions. So long as we qualify as a REIT, the distributions that we make to our taxable domestic stockholders out of current or accumulated
earnings and profits that we do not designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taken into account by stockholders as ordinary income and
will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporations. With limited exceptions, our dividends are not eligible for taxation at the
preferential income tax rates (i.e., the 20% federal income tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers) for qualified dividends received by domestic
stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates from taxable C corporations. For taxable years prior to 2026, individual stockholders are
generally allowed to deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends distributed by us, subject to certain limitations, which would
reduce the maximum marginal effective federal income tax rate for individuals on the receipt of such ordinary dividends to 29.6%. Such
stockholders, however, are taxed at the preferential rates on dividends designated by and received from REITs to the extent that the dividends are
attributable to:
•income retained by the REIT in the prior taxable year on which the REIT was subject to corporate level income tax (less the amount of tax);
•dividends received by the REIT from TRSs or other taxable C corporations; or
•income in the prior taxable year from the sales of ""built-in gain"" property acquired by the REIT from C corporations in carryover basis transactions
(less the amount of corporate tax on such income).
Distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taxed to our domestic stockholders as long-term capital gains, to the
extent that such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year, without regard to the period for which the stockholder
that receives such distribution has held its stock. We may elect to retain and pay taxes on some or all of our net long-term capital gains, in which
case provisions of the Code will treat a stockholder as having received, solely for tax purposes, its pro rata share of our undistributed capital gains,
and the stockholders will receive a corresponding credit for taxes that we paid on such undistributed capital gains. See ""Annual Distribution
Requirements."" Corporate stockholders may be required to treat up to 20% of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. Subject to the
discussion below on additional Medicare tax on net investment income, long-term capital gains are generally taxable at maximum federal income tax
rates of 20% in the case of stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates, and 21% in the case of stockholders that are
162
Table of Contents
corporations. Capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held for more than 12 months are subject to a 25% maximum federal
income tax rate for taxpayers who are taxed as individuals, to the extent of previously claimed depreciation deductions.
Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will generally represent a return of capital and will not be taxable to a
stockholder to the extent that the amount of such distributions does not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares in respect of which
the distributions were made. Rather, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares. To the extent that such distributions
exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder's shares, the stockholder generally must include such distributions in income as long-term capital gain,
or short-term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less. In addition, any dividend that we declare in October, November or
December of any year and that is payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and
received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that we actually pay the dividend before the end of January of the following
calendar year.
To the extent that we have available net operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount
of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See ""Annual Distribution Requirements."" Such
losses, however, are not passed through to stockholders and do not offset income of stockholders from other sources, nor would such losses
affect the character of any distributions that we make, which are generally subject to tax in the hands of stockholders to the extent that we have
current or accumulated earnings and profits.
Dispositions of our stock. If a domestic stockholder sells or disposes of shares of our capital stock, it generally will recognize gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on
the sale or other disposition and its adjusted basis in the shares of capital stock for tax purposes. This gain or loss will generally be long-term
capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held the capital stock for more than one year at the time of such sale or disposition. In general, capital
gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates upon the sale or disposition of our stock will be subject to preferential rates if the stock is held
for more than one year, and will be taxed at ordinary income rates if the stock is held for one year or less. Gains recognized by stockholders that are
corporations are subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of 21%, whether or not such gains are classified as long-term capital gains. Capital
losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our stock that was held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be
considered long-term capital losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income
(except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). In addition, any loss upon a sale or exchange of
shares of our stock by a stockholder who has held the shares for six months or less, after applying holding period rules, will be treated as a long-
term capital loss to the extent of distributions that we make that are required to be treated by the stockholder as long-term capital gain.
If an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our stock or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it
is possible that the provisions of U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations involving ""reportable transactions"" could apply, with a resulting
requirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the IRS. These regulations, though directed towards ""tax shelters,"" are
broadly written and apply to transactions that may not typically be considered tax shelters. The Code imposes significant penalties for failure to
comply with these requirements. You should consult your tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or
disposition of our stock or securities or transactions that we might undertake directly or indirectly. Moreover, you should be aware that we and
other participants in the transactions in which we are involved (including their advisors) might be subject to disclosure or other requirements
pursuant to these regulations.
Additional Medicare Tax on Unearned Income. Certain ""high income"" taxable domestic stockholders, including individuals, estates and trusts, will
be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on their ""net investment"" income. The temporary 20% deduction allowed by Section 199A of the
Code, as added by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with respect to ordinary REIT dividends received by non-corporate taxpayers is allowed only for
purposes of Chapter 1 of the Code and thus is apparently not allowed as a deduction allocable to such dividends for purposes of determining the
amount of net investment income subject to the 3.8% Medicare tax, which is imposed under
163
Table of Contents
Chapter 2A of the Code. U.S. stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the additional Medicare tax resulting
from an investment in our shares.
Passive Activity Losses and Investment Interest Limitations. Distributions that we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a domestic
stockholder of our stock will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, stockholders will not be able to apply any ""passive losses""
against income or gain relating to our stock. To the extent that distributions we make do not constitute a return of capital, they will be treated as
investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation.
Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders
The following is a summary of certain federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our stock applicable to
certain non-U.S. holders. A ""non-U.S. holder"" is any person other than a domestic stockholder or an entity treated as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes.
The following discussion is based on current law, and is for general information only. It addresses only selected, and not all, aspects of federal
income and estate taxation.
Ordinary dividends. The portion of distributions received by non-U.S. holders that (i) is payable out of our earnings and profits, (ii) is not
attributable to our capital gains and (iii) is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder, will be subject to U.S.
withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless reduced or eliminated by treaty. We generally plan to withhold U.S. income tax at the rate of 30% on the
gross amount of any such distribution paid to a non-U.S. holder unless either:
•a lower treaty rate applies and the non-U.S. stockholder files an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E evidencing eligibility for that reduced
rate with us; or
•the non-U.S. stockholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.
Reduced treaty rates and other exemptions are not available to the extent that income is attributable to excess inclusion income (i.e., certain income
from taxable mortgage pools or REMIC residual interests) allocable to the non-U.S. holder. Accordingly, we will withhold at a rate of 30% on any
portion of a distribution that is paid to a non-U.S. holder and attributable to that holder's share of our excess inclusion income. As required by IRS
guidance, we intend to notify the W. P. Carey Stockholders if a portion of a distribution paid by us is attributable to excess inclusion income.
Subject to the discussion below, in general, non-U.S. holders will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business solely as a result of
their ownership of our stock. In cases where the dividend income from a non-U.S. holder's investment in our stock is, or is treated as, effectively
connected with the non-U.S. holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to federal income tax at
graduated rates, in the same manner as domestic stockholders are taxed with respect to such distributions. Such income must generally be reported
on a U.S. income tax return filed by or on behalf of the non-U.S. holder. The income may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of
a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation.
Non-dividend distributions. Unless our stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest (a ""USRPI""), distributions that we make that are not out of
our earnings and profits will not be subject to U.S. income tax. If we cannot determine at the time a distribution is made whether or not the
distribution will exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be subject to withholding at the rate applicable to
ordinary dividends. The non-U.S. holder may seek a refund from the IRS of any amounts withheld if it is subsequently determined that the
distribution was, in fact, in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. If our stock constitutes a USRPI, as described below,
distributions that we make in excess of the sum of (i) the stockholder's proportionate share of our earnings and profits, plus (ii) the stockholder's
basis in its stock, will be taxed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (""FIRPTA"") (unless an exemption to FIRPTA applies
for a specific non-U.S. holder) at the rate of tax, including any applicable capital gains rates, that would apply to a domestic stockholder of the same
type (e.g., an individual or a corporation, as the case may be), and the collection of the tax
164
Table of Contents
will be enforced by a refundable withholding at a rate of 15% of the amount by which the distribution exceeds the stockholder's share of our
earnings and profits.
Capital gain distributions. Under FIRPTA, a distribution that we make to a non-U.S. holder, to the extent attributable to gains from dispositions of
USRPIs that we held directly or through pass-through subsidiaries, or ""USRPI capital gains,"" will, except as described below, be considered
effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and will be subject to U.S. income tax at the rates applicable to U.S.
individuals or corporations, without regard to whether we designate the distribution as a capital gain distribution. See above under ""- Ordinary
Dividends,"" for a discussion of the consequences of income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In addition, we will be
required to withhold tax equal to 21% of the amount of distributions to the extent the distributions constitute USRPI capital gains. Distributions
subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation. A distribution is not a
USRPI capital gain if we held an interest in the underlying asset solely as a creditor. Capital gain distributions received by a non-U.S. holder that are
attributable to dispositions of our assets other than USRPIs are not subject to federal income or withholding tax, unless (1) the gain is effectively
connected with the non-U.S. holder's U.S. trade or business and, if certain treaties apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment
maintained by the non-U.S. holder, in which case the non-U.S. holder would be subject to the same treatment as U.S. holders with respect to such
gain, or (2) the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year
and has a ""tax home"" in the United States, in which case the non-U.S. holder will incur a 30% tax on his or her capital gains.
A capital gain distribution that would otherwise have been treated as a USRPI capital gain will not be so treated or be subject to FIRPTA, and
generally will not be treated as income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and instead will be treated in the same manner as
an ordinary dividend, if (1) the capital gain distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established
securities market located in the United States, and (2) the recipient non-U.S. holder does not own more than 5% of that class of stock at any time
during the year ending on the date on which the capital gain distribution is received. The shares of our Common Stock are listed on the NYSE under
the symbol ""WPC.""
Dispositions of our stock. Unless our stock constitutes a USRPI, a sale of our stock by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S.
taxation under FIRPTA. Our stock could be treated as a USRPI if 50% or more of our assets at any time during a prescribed testing period consist of
interests in real property located within the United States, excluding, for this purpose, interests in real property solely in a capacity as a creditor. We
expect to meet this 50% test.
Even if the foregoing 50% test is met, however, our stock nonetheless will not constitute a USRPI if we are a ""domestically-controlled qualified
investment entity."" A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT, less than 50% of value of which is held directly or
indirectly by non-U.S. holders at all times during a specified testing period. In addition, certain favorable presumptions aid in determination of
whether we are a domestically-controlled qualified entity. We believe that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity, and that a
sale of our stock should not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA.
In the event that we are not a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity, but our stock is ""regularly traded,"" as defined by applicable U.S.
Department of Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, a non-U.S. holder's sale of our common stock nonetheless would not be
subject to tax under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI, provided that the selling non-U.S. holder held 10% or less of our outstanding common stock at all
times during a specified testing period.
If gain on the sale of our stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, or in the absence of a specific exemption for a non-U.S. holder, the non-U.S.
holder would be required to file a federal income tax return and would be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. stockholder with respect to such
gain, subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of non-resident alien individuals, and the
purchaser of the stock could be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the IRS.

FIRPTA Exemption - Qualified Shareholders. Subject to the exception discussed below, any distribution to a ""qualified shareholder"" who holds
stock of a REIT directly or indirectly (through one or more partnerships) will not be subject to United States tax as income effectively connected
with a United States trade or business and thus will not be subject to special withholding rules under FIRPTA. While a ""qualified shareholder"" will
not be subject to FIRPTA withholding on REIT distributions, certain investors of a ""qualified shareholder"" (i.e., non-United States persons who
hold interests in the ""qualified shareholder"" (other than interests solely as a creditor), and hold more than 10% of the stock of the REIT in which the
""qualified shareholder"" holds stock (whether or not by reason of the investor's ownership in the ""qualified shareholder"")) may be subject to
FIRPTA withholding.
A ""qualified shareholder"" is a foreign person that (i) either is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty which includes an
exchange of information program and whose principal class of interests is listed and regularly traded on one or more recognized stock exchanges
(as defined in such comprehensive income tax treaty), or is a foreign partnership that is created or organized under foreign law as a limited
partnership in a jurisdiction that has an agreement for the exchange of information with respect to taxes with the United States and has a class of
limited partnership units representing greater than 50% of the value of all the partnership units that is regularly traded on the NYSE or NASDAQ
markets, (ii) is a qualified collective investment vehicle (defined below), and (iii) maintains records on the identity of each person who, at any time
during the foreign person's taxable year, is the direct owner of 5% or more of the class of interests or units (as applicable) described in (i), above.
A qualified collective investment vehicle is a foreign person that (i) would be eligible for a reduced rate of withholding with respect to ordinary
dividends under the comprehensive income tax treaty described above, even if such entity holds more than 10% of the stock of such REIT, (ii) is
publicly traded (as defined in Section 7704(b) of the Code), is treated as a partnership under the Internal Revenue Code, is a withholding foreign
partnership for purposes of United States withholding taxes, and would be treated as a United States real property holding company if it were a
domestic corporation, or (iii) is designated as such by the Secretary of the Treasury and is either (a) fiscally transparent within the meaning of
Section 894 of the Code, or (b) required to include dividends in its gross income, but is entitled to a deduction for distributions to its investors.
FIRPTA Exemption - Qualified Foreign Pension Funds. Any distribution treated as a capital gain to a ""qualified foreign pension fund"" or an entity
all of the interests of which are held by a ""qualified foreign pension fund"" who holds REIT stock directly or indirectly (through one or more
partnerships) will generally not be subject to United States tax as income effectively connected with a United States trade or business and thus will
not be subject to the withholding rules under FIRPTA.
A qualified foreign pension fund is any trust, corporation, or other organization or arrangement (i) which is created or organized under the law of a
country other than the United States, (ii) which is established to provide retirement or pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are
current or former employees (or persons designated by such employees) of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered, (iii)
which does not have a single participant or beneficiary with a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government
regulation and provides annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to the relevant tax authorities in the country in which it is established
or operates and (v) with respect to which, under the laws of the country in which it is established or operates, (A) contributions to such
organization or arrangement that would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of such entity
or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of any investment income of such organization or arrangement is deferred or such income is taxed at a
reduced rate.
Wash sales - In general, special wash sale rules apply if a stockholder owning more than 5% of our common stock avoids a taxable distribution of
gain recognized from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests by selling our common stock before the ex-dividend date of the distribution
and then, within a designated period, enters into an option or contract to acquire shares of the same or a substantially identical class of our
common stock. If a wash sale occurs, then the seller/repurchaser will be treated as having gain recognized from the sale or exchange of U.S. real
property interests in the same amount as if the avoided distribution had actually been received. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax
advisors on the special wash sale rules that apply to non-U.S. holders.
166
Table of Contents
Estate tax - If our stock is owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident (as specially defined for federal estate tax
purposes) of the United States at the time of such individual's death, the stock will be includable in the individual's gross estate for federal estate
tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and may therefore be subject to federal estate tax.
FATCA Withholding
Foreign Accounts
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (""FATCA""), generally impose a
withholding tax of 30% on payments of U.S. source dividend, interest or other fixed or determinable annual or periodic income and gross proceeds
from the disposition of property of a type that can produce U.S.-source dividends or interest to certain foreign persons, whether as the beneficial
owner or as an intermediary for the ultimate beneficial owner, including both (i) a ""foreign financial institution"" (as defined in the Code), unless
such institution is ""deemed compliant,"" complies with the rules implementing an applicable intergovernmental agreement and/or enters into an
agreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of
such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities
with U.S. owners) and (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution in certain cases, unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a
certification identifying the substantial U.S. owners of the entity, which generally include any U.S. person who directly or indirectly owns more than
10% of the entity.
Under applicable U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, FATCA withholding generally applies to payments of
dividends on our capital stock. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of stock on or after January 1, 2019, proposed U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of
gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers may generally rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations
are issued. Certain countries have entered into, and other countries are expected to enter into, agreements with the U.S. to facilitate the type of
information reporting required under FATCA. While the existence of such agreements will not eliminate the risk that payments to foreign financial
institutions or non-financial foreign entities in those countries will be subject to FATCA withholding, these agreements are expected to reduce the
risk of the withholding for investors in those countries. If you hold our stock through a foreign account or intermediary, you are urged to consult
your tax advisor regarding the implications of FATCA to you.
Taxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders
Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts, generally are exempt from
federal income taxation. However, they may be subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). While some investments in
real estate may generate UBTI, the IRS has ruled that dividend distributions from a REIT to a tax-exempt employee pension trust do not
automatically constitute UBTI. Based on that ruling, and provided that (1) a tax-exempt stockholder has not held our stock as ""debt financed
property"" within the meaning of the Code (e.g., where the acquisition or holding of the property is financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt
stockholder), and (2) our stock is not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business, distributions that we make and income from the sale of our
stock generally should not give rise to UBTI to a tax-exempt stockholder.
Tax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified
group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) and (c)(20) of the Code are subject to
different UBTI rules, which generally require such stockholders to characterize distributions that we make as UBTI.
In certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock by value could be required to treat a percentage of its distributions
as UBTI, if we are a ""pension-held REIT."" We will not be a pension-held REIT unless either (1) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value
of our stock, or (2) a group of pension trusts, each individually holding more than 10% of the value of our stock, collectively owns more than 50%
of the value of our stock. Certain restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock should generally prevent a tax-exempt entity
167
Table of Contents
from owning more than 10% of the value of our stock and should generally prevent us from becoming a ""pension-held REIT.""
Tax-exempt stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of
owning our stock.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
We will report to our domestic stockholders and the IRS the amount of dividends paid during each calendar year and the amount of any tax
withheld. Under the backup withholding rules, a domestic stockholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to dividends paid unless
the holder is a corporation or comes within other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact or provides a taxpayer identification
number or social security number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. A domestic stockholder that does not provide his or her correct taxpayer identification number or
social security number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. In addition, we may be
required to withhold a portion of a capital gain distribution to any domestic stockholder who fails to certify its non-foreign status.
We must report annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. stockholder the amount of dividends paid to such holder and the tax withheld with
respect to such dividends, regardless of whether withholding was required. Copies of the information returns reporting such dividends and
withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. stockholder resides under the provisions of an
applicable income tax treaty. A non-U.S. stockholder may be subject to backup withholding unless applicable certification requirements are met.
Payment of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock within the U.S. is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. stockholder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to
know that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of our common
stock conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to information reporting (but not backup withholding) unless the
financial intermediary has documentary evidence in its records that the beneficial owner is a non-U.S. stockholder and specified conditions are met
or an exemption is otherwise established. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against
such holder's federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.
Legislative or Other Actions Affecting REITs
The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the
U.S. Department of Treasury. Changes to the federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect an investment in our stock.
State, Local and Foreign Taxes
We and our subsidiaries and stockholders may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or
they transact business, own property or reside. We own real property assets located in numerous jurisdictions and will be required to file tax
returns in some of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or foreign tax treatment and that of the W. P. Carey Stockholders may not conform to the
federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may own foreign real estate assets and pay foreign property taxes, and dispositions of foreign
property or operations involving, or investments in, foreign real estate assets may give rise to foreign income or other tax liability in amounts that
could be substantial. Any foreign taxes that we incur do not pass through to stockholders as a credit against their federal income tax liability.
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax laws on
an investment in our stock.

W. P. Carey
W. P. Carey will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2022, which is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the W. P. Carey 2022
annual meeting, regardless of whether the Merger has been completed. The deadline to submit a stockholder proposal intended to be presented at
the W. P. Carey 2022 annual meeting and considered for inclusion in W. P. Carey’s proxy materials has already passed. W. P. Carey Stockholders
interested in proposing a matter for a vote by the W. P. Carey Stockholders at the W. P. Carey 2023 annual meeting must submit the proposal no later
than December 2, 2022, in order for it to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the 2023 annual meeting pursuant to Rule
14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
In order for proposals submitted outside of Rule 14a-8 to be considered at the 2023 annual meeting, stockholder proposals, including stockholder
nominations for director, must comply with the advance notice and eligibility requirements contained in the W. P. Carey Bylaws. The W. P. Carey
Bylaws provide that stockholders are required to give advance notice to W. P. Carey of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an
annual stockholders' meeting. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must give timely
written notice thereof to the Corporate Secretary of W. P. Carey. In order to be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and
received at the principal executive offices of W. P. Carey not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 120th day nor earlier than 150 days prior to the
first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the preceding year's annual meeting. Therefore, any stockholder proposals, including
nominations for directors, submitted outside of Rule 14a-8 to be voted on at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders must have been received by
W. P. Carey not earlier than November 2, 2022 and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 2, 2022, being, respectively, 150 and 120 days
prior to April 1, 2023, which is the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the W. P. Carey 2022 annual meeting. However, in the
event that the date of the annual meeting of stockholders in 2023 is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from such anniversary date, notice
by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered not earlier than the 150th day prior to such changed annual meeting date and not later than 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time, on the later of the 120th day prior to such changed annual meeting date or the tenth day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.
A copy of the W. P. Carey Bylaws is available upon request. Such requests and any stockholder proposals should be sent to Susan C. Hyde, Chief
Administrative Officer and Corporate Secretary, W. P. Carey, One Manhattan West, 395 9th Avenue, 58th Floor, New York, NY 10001. These
procedures apply to any matter that a stockholder wishes to raise at any annual meeting, including those matters raised other than pursuant to Rule
14a-8. A stockholder proposal that does not meet the above requirements will be considered untimely, and any proxy solicited by W. P. Carey may
confer discretionary authority to vote on such proposal.

of any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify CPA18 and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company and W. P. Carey, promptly thereof; provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of CPA18, the

materially less favorable on the whole to the insured persons than, the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by CPA18 and the CPA18 Subsidiaries.

provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of W. P. Carey and the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume

CPA18 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, shall pay to the party entitled to receive such payment (the ""Receiving Party"") from the
amount deposited into escrow in accordance with this Section 6.6(a), an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Expense Amount and
(ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Receiving Party without causing the Receiving Party to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code for the year in which the Expense Amount would otherwise be
payable, for this purpose treating such amount as income that does not qualify for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the
Code, as determined by the Receiving Party's independent certified public accountants, plus (B) if the Receiving Party receives
either (1) a letter from the Receiving Party's counsel indicating that the Receiving Party has received a ruling from the IRS
described in Section 6.6(b) or (2) an opinion from the Receiving Party's counsel as described in Section 6.6(b), an amount equal
to the Expense Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. To the extent the entire Expense Amount is not paid to
the Receiving Party in the year in which such amount would otherwise be payable as a result of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.6(a), the Expense Amount shall be carried forward to the succeeding year and shall be payable (as described above) in
such succeeding year by applying the same formula and by deeming such Expense Amount as payable in such succeeding year. To
the extent the full Expense Amount has not been paid in the initial and succeeding year, the amount shall similarly be carried
forward for each of the next three taxable years. To the extent that the entire Expense Amount has not been paid in the initial year,
the succeeding year and the three following years, the Expense Amount shall be forfeited by the Receiving Party. To secure the
obligation of CPA18 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, to pay these amounts, CPA18 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, shall deposit into
escrow an amount in cash equal to the Expense Amount with an escrow agent selected by CPA18 or W. P. Carey, as applicable,
and on such terms (subject to Section 6.6(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by CPA18 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, the
Receiving Party and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount pursuant to this Section 6.6(a)

Receiving Party unless the escrow agent receives any of the following: (i) a letter from the Receiving Party's independent certified
public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Receiving Party without causing the
payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount
did not constitute income that qualifies for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code (""Qualifying Income"") or a
subsequent
A - 54Table of Contents
letter from the Receiving Party's accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Receiving Party, or (ii) a letter from the Receiving Party's counsel indicating that the Receiving Party received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income for purposes of Code Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) (or alternatively, the Receiving Party's counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code), in which
case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Expense Amount to the Receiving Party. CPA18 and W. P. Carey each
agree to amend this Section 6.6 at the request of the Receiving Party in order to (A) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount
that may be distributed to the Receiving Party hereunder without causing the Receiving Party to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code, (B) improve the likelihood of the Receiving Party securing a ruling described in this
Section 6.6(b), or (C) assist the Receiving Party in obtaining a legal opinion from its counsel as described in this Section 6.6(b).
The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Expense Amount not paid to the Receiving Party in the initial year
and the four succeeding years shall be released by the escrow agent to CPA18 or W. P. Carey, as applicable. Unless such party is
the Receiving Party, none of CPA18 or W. P. Carey shall be a party to such escrow agreement, and neither shall bear any cost of
or have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.
