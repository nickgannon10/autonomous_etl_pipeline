XILINX INC_20210305_DEFM14A_19107214_4148221.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as an AMD or Xilinx stockholder, may have
regarding the merger and the other matters being considered at the AMD and Xilinx special meetings, as
applicable. You are urged to carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in their entirety because this section may not provide all
the information that is important to you regarding these matters. See “Summary” for a summary of important
information regarding the merger agreement, the merger and the related transactions. Additional important
information is contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference in, this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, without charge, by following the instructions under “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?
You are receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus because Xilinx has agreed to be acquired by AMD
through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Xilinx, with Xilinx continuing as the surviving corporation in
the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD. The merger agreement, which governs the terms
and conditions of the merger, is attached as Annex A hereto.
Your vote is required in connection with the merger. AMD and Xilinx are sending these materials to their
respective stockholders to help them decide how to vote their shares with respect to the share issuance, in the
case of AMD, the adoption of the merger agreement, in the case of Xilinx, and other important matters.
What matters am I being asked to vote on?
In order to complete the merger, among other things:
AMD stockholders must approve the AMD share issuance proposal; and
Xilinx stockholders must approve the Xilinx merger proposal.
AMD: AMD is holding the AMD special meeting to obtain approval of the AMD share issuance proposal and
the AMD adjournment proposal.
Xilinx: Xilinx is holding the Xilinx special meeting to obtain approval of the Xilinx merger proposal. At the
Xilinx special meeting, Xilinx stockholders will also be asked to consider and vote on the Xilinx compensation
proposal and the Xilinx adjournment proposal.
Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The approval of the AMD share
issuance proposal and the Xilinx merger proposal are conditions to the obligations of AMD and Xilinx to
complete the merger. The approval of the AMD adjournment proposal, the Xilinx compensation proposal and
the Xilinx adjournment proposal are not conditions to the obligations of AMD or Xilinx to complete the
merger.
When and where will each of the special meetings take place?
AMD: The AMD special meeting will be held solely virtually via live webcast on April 7, 2021, beginning at
9:30 a.m., Pacific Time. AMD stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting

that you vote by proxy in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not
to or become unable to virtually attend the applicable special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may virtually attend and vote at your respective company’s
special meeting only if you obtain a specific control number from your bank, broker or other nominee giving
you the right to vote such shares.
Does my vote matter?
Yes, your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The merger cannot be
completed unless the AMD share issuance proposal is approved by AMD stockholders and the Xilinx merger
proposal is approved by Xilinx stockholders.
AMD
AMD Share Issuance Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval
of the AMD share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of AMD common stock that are virtually present via the AMD special
meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the
AMD share issuance proposal. Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by proxy
(including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a
bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee)
will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD share issuance proposal. An abstention or other
failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD
special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the AMD share issuance proposal. However,
assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares
in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or
more other proposals, but not for the AMD share issuance proposal, voting power will deemed to be
withheld with respect to the AMD share issuance proposal and such failure to provide voting
instructions will have no effect on the AMD share issuance proposal.
AMD Adjournment Proposal. Whether or not a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting,
approval of the AMD adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD common stock that are virtually present via the AMD
special meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on
the AMD adjournment proposal. Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by
proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through
a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee)
will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD adjournment proposal. An abstention or other failure
of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special
meeting on the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
AMD adjournment proposal to vote on the AMD adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the AMD adjournment proposal. However, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares
in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more
other proposals, but not for the AMD adjournment proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld
with respect to the AMD adjournment proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will
have no effect on the AMD adjournment proposal.
Xilinx
Xilinx merger proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the
Xilinx merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx
merger proposal. The failure to vote by proxy or to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special
meeting, including an abstention, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx merger
proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting).
Xilinx compensation proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval
of the Xilinx compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special
meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. The failure
to vote by proxy and to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting will have no effect on
the Xilinx compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting).
Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, any shares not virtually
present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares
in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Xilinx compensation proposal. An
abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
at the Xilinx special meeting to vote on the Xilinx compensation proposal will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx compensation proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one
or more other proposals, but not for the Xilinx compensation proposal, it will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx compensation proposal.
Xilinx adjournment proposal. Whether or not a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting,
approval of the Xilinx adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx
special meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting.
Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of
a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to
provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome
of the Xilinx adjournment proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx adjournment
proposal to vote on the Xilinx adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Xilinx adjournment proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street
name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other
proposals, but not for the Xilinx adjournment proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Xilinx adjournment proposal.
What will Xilinx stockholders receive for their shares of Xilinx common stock if the merger is completed?
If the merger is completed, each share of Xilinx common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock, which number is
referred to as the “exchange ratio.” Each Xilinx stockholder will receive cash (without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes) in lieu of any fractional shares of AMD common stock that such Xilinx
3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
stockholder would otherwise receive in the merger. Any cash amounts to be received by a Xilinx stockholder
in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock will be rounded to the nearest whole cent.
Because AMD will issue a fixed number of shares of AMD common stock in exchange for each share of Xilinx
common stock, the value of the merger consideration that Xilinx stockholders will receive in the merger will
depend on the market price of shares of AMD common stock at the time the merger is completed. The market
price of shares of AMD common stock that Xilinx stockholders receive at the time the merger is completed
could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of shares of AMD common stock on the date
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or at the times of the AMD and Xilinx special meetings. Accordingly,
you should obtain current market quotations for AMD common stock and Xilinx common stock before
deciding how to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal and the Xilinx merger proposal, as applicable.
AMD and Xilinx common stock are traded on Nasdaq, under the symbols “AMD” and “XLNX,” respectively.
Shares of common stock of the combined company will trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “AMD” after
completion of the merger. For more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by Xilinx
stockholders if the merger is completed, see “The Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration.”
How does the AMD board of directors recommend that I vote at the AMD special meeting?
The AMD board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the AMD share issuance
proposal and “FOR” the AMD adjournment proposal.
Other than with respect to continued service for, employment by and the right to continued indemnification by
the combined company, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AMD directors and executive
officers do not have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other
AMD stockholders generally. See “Interests of AMD Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
How does the Xilinx board of directors recommend that I vote at the Xilinx special meeting?
The Xilinx board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Xilinx merger proposal,
“FOR” the Xilinx compensation proposal and “FOR” the Xilinx adjournment proposal.
In considering the recommendations of the Xilinx board of directors, Xilinx stockholders should be aware that
Xilinx directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to,
their interests as Xilinx stockholders generally. These interests may include, among others, the payment of
severance benefits and acceleration of outstanding Xilinx equity awards upon certain terminations of
employment or service, and the combined company’s agreement to indemnify Xilinx directors and executive
officers against certain claims and liabilities. For a more complete description of these interests, see “Interests
of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Who is entitled to vote at each special meeting?
AMD
All holders of record of shares of AMD common stock who held shares at the close of business on February
10, 2021 (the AMD record date) are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the AMD special meeting.
Each such holder of AMD common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before

applicable, is referred to as a “proxy card.”

What constitutes a quorum for each special meeting?
AMD
A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be represented, either through virtual attendance or
through representation by proxy, to hold a valid meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the AMD share issuance proposal is not approved by AMD stockholders, if the Xilinx merger proposal is
not approved by Xilinx stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Xilinx
stockholders will not receive the merger consideration or any other consideration in connection with the
merger, and their shares of Xilinx common stock will remain outstanding.
If the merger is not completed, Xilinx will remain an independent public company, the Xilinx common stock will
continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq under the symbol “XLNX” and AMD will not complete the share
issuance contemplated by the merger agreement, regardless of whether the AMD share issuance proposal has
been approved by AMD stockholders.
If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, including if the Xilinx board of directors
changes its recommendation, Xilinx may be required to pay AMD a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger
agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required
regulatory approvals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger
agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes
its recommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. See “The Merger
Agreement-Termination Fees.”
How can I virtually vote my shares at my respective special meeting?
AMD
Shares held directly in your name as an AMD stockholder of record may be virtually voted at the AMD special
meeting via the AMD special meeting website. You will need the 16-digit control number included on your
proxy card in order to access and vote via the AMD special meeting website as described under “The AMD
Special Meeting-Virtually Attending the AMD Special Meeting.”
Shares held in “street name” may be virtually voted at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting
website only if you obtain a specific control number and follow the instructions provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee. See “The AMD Special Meeting-Virtually Attending the AMD Special Meeting.”
Xilinx
Shares held directly in your name as a Xilinx stockholder of record may be virtually voted at the Xilinx special
meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website. In order to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special
meeting, you must first register at the Xilinx special meeting website in order to obtain a unique meeting
invitation by electronic mail.
Shares held in “street name” may be virtually voted at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting
website only if you obtain a specific control number and follow the instructions provided by your, broker or
other nominee. See “The Xilinx Special Meeting-Virtually Attending the Xilinx Special Meeting.”
Even if you plan to virtually attend your respective company’s special meeting via the applicable special
meeting website, AMD and Xilinx recommend that you vote by proxy in advance as described below so that
your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or become unable to virtually attend the respective special
meeting.
For additional information on virtually attending the special meetings, see “The AMD Special Meeting” and
“The Xilinx Special Meeting.”
How can I vote my shares without virtually attending my company’s special meeting?
Whether you hold your shares directly as a stockholder of record of AMD or Xilinx or beneficially in “street
name,” you may direct your vote by proxy without virtually attending the AMD or Xilinx special meeting, as
applicable. If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the internet, by telephone or by mail
by
6 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares beneficially in “street
name,” you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
For additional information on voting procedures, see “The AMD Special Meeting” and “The Xilinx Special
Meeting.”
What is a “broker non-vote”?
Under Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote “uninstructed”
shares (i.e., shares of record held by banks, brokers or other nominees, but with respect to which the
beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on how to vote on a particular proposal) with
respect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. All of the
proposals currently expected to be brought before the AMD and Xilinx special meetings are “non-routine”
matters under Nasdaq rules.
A “broker non-vote” occurs on an item when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to
vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on
other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails
to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with such instructions. Because all of the proposals currently
expected to be voted on at the AMD and Xilinx special meetings are non-routine matters under Nasdaq rules
for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote, AMD and Xilinx do not expect there to be any
broker non-votes at the AMD or Xilinx special meetings.
What stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the AMD special meeting? What will happen if I
fail to vote or abstain from voting on each proposal at the AMD special meeting?
AMD Proposal 1: AMD Share Issuance Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD share issuance proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD
common stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal. Accordingly, any shares
not virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD share issuance proposal. An
abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the
AMD special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the AMD share issuance proposal. However, assuming a quorum is
present at the AMD special meeting, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a
bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not for the
AMD share issuance proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld with respect to the AMD share
issuance proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will have no effect on the AMD share
issuance proposal.
AMD Proposal 2: AMD Adjournment Proposal
Whether or not a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD
common stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD adjournment proposal. Accordingly, any shares not
virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD adjournment proposal. An abstention
or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special
meeting on the AMD

TABLE OF CONTENTS
adjournment proposal to vote on the AMD adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the AMD adjournment proposal. However, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares in “street
name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals,
but not for the AMD adjournment proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld with respect to the AMD
adjournment proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will have no effect on the AMD
adjournment proposal.
What stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the Xilinx special meeting? What will happen if I
fail to vote or abstain from voting on each proposal at the Xilinx special meeting?
Xilinx Proposal 1: Xilinx Merger Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx merger proposal requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx merger proposal. Accordingly, an abstention or
other failure to vote on the Xilinx merger proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx
merger proposal.
Xilinx Proposal 2: Xilinx Compensation Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx compensation proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx
common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special
meeting, any shares not virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx
stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting
instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Xilinx
compensation proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting to vote on the Xilinx compensation proposal will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx compensation proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who
holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or
more other proposals, but not for the Xilinx compensation proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Xilinx compensation proposal.
Xilinx Proposal 3: Xilinx Adjournment Proposal
Whether or not a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx
common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by
proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank,
broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no
effect on the outcome of the Xilinx adjournment proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares
virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting to vote on the
Xilinx adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx adjournment proposal.
In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee
provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not for the Xilinx adjournment proposal, it
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx adjournment proposal.
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, the merger-related
compensation for Xilinx named executive officers (the Xilinx compensation proposal)?
Under SEC rules, Xilinx is required to seek a non-binding advisory vote of its stockholders relating to the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Xilinx named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger (also known as “golden parachute” compensation).
8 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if Xilinx stockholders do not approve, by non-binding advisory vote, the merger-related compensation for
Xilinx named executive officers (the Xilinx compensation proposal)?
Because the vote on the proposal to approve the Xilinx compensation proposal is advisory in nature, the
outcome of the vote will not be binding upon Xilinx or the combined company. Accordingly, the merger-related
compensation, which is described under “Interests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,”
may be paid to Xilinx named executive officers even if Xilinx stockholders do not approve the Xilinx
compensation proposal.
What if I hold shares of both AMD and Xilinx common stock?
If you are both an AMD stockholder and a Xilinx stockholder, you will receive two separate packages of proxy
materials. A vote cast as an AMD stockholder will not count as a vote cast as a Xilinx stockholder, and a vote
cast as a Xilinx stockholder will not count as a vote cast as an AMD stockholder. Therefore, please follow the
instructions received with each set of materials you receive in order to submit separate proxies for your shares of AMD
common stock and your shares of Xilinx common stock.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares held in
“street name”?
If your shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent of
AMD and Xilinx, respectively, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As
the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote directly at the applicable special meeting. You may also
grant a proxy directly to AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, or to a third party to vote your shares at the applicable
special meeting.
If your shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are
considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name.” Your bank, broker or other nominee will send
you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedures for voting your shares. You should follow
the instructions provided by them to vote your shares. In order to virtually attend and vote at the AMD
special meeting via the AMD special meeting website or the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special
meeting website, you will need to obtain a specific control number and follow the other procedures provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee.
If my shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my
bank, broker or other nominee automatically vote those shares for me?
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of AMD or Xilinx common
stock, as applicable, if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the
procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares. Under
Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock in “street
name” for their customers have authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received
instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are prohibited from
exercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters, which include all the proposals
currently scheduled to be considered and voted on at the AMD and Xilinx special meetings. As a result,
absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokers and other nominees are
not empowered to vote such shares.
For AMD stockholders, the effect of not instructing your bank, broker or other nominee how you wish to vote
your shares of AMD common stock will have no effect on the AMD share issuance proposal or the AMD
adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting).
For Xilinx stockholders, the effect of not instructing your bank, broker or other nominee how you wish to vote
your shares of Xilinx common stock will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx merger proposal, but will
have no effect on the Xilinx compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special
meeting) or the Xilinx adjournment proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street

solicitation of proxies for the AMD special meeting. AMD estimates that it will pay Mackenzie Partners a fee
of approximately $60,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. AMD has agreed to
indemnify Mackenzie Partners against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its
solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
Xilinx has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated, which is referred to as “Innisfree,” to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for the Xilinx special meeting. Xilinx estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee of
approximately $40,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Xilinx has agreed to
indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of
proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
AMD and Xilinx also may be required to reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries or their respective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of
AMD and Xilinx common stock, respectively. AMD and Xilinx directors, officers and employees also may
solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts
for soliciting proxies.
When is the merger expected to be completed?
Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described under “The Merger Agreement-​
Conditions to the Completion of the Merger,” including approval of the AMD share issuance proposal by
AMD stockholders and approval of the Xilinx merger proposal by Xilinx stockholders, the merger is currently
expected to be completed by the end of the 2021 calendar year. However, neither AMD nor Xilinx can predict
the actual date on which the merger will be completed, or if the merger will be completed at all, because
completion of the merger is subject to conditions and factors beyond the control of both companies, including
the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals. AMD and Xilinx hope to complete the merger as soon as
reasonably practicable. Also see “The Merger-Regulatory Approvals.”
What respective equity stakes will AMD and Xilinx stockholders hold in the combined company immediately following
the merger?
Based on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock outstanding on February 10, 2021, the latest
practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, upon completion of the merger,
former Xilinx stockholders are expected to own approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of AMD
common stock and AMD stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately
74.1% of the outstanding shares of AMD common stock. The relative ownership interests of AMD
stockholders and former Xilinx stockholders in the combined company immediately following the merger will
depend on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the merger.
If I am a Xilinx stockholder, how will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?
If you hold your shares of Xilinx common stock in book-entry form, whether through The Depository Trust
Company, which is referred to as “DTC,” or otherwise, you will not be required to take any specific actions to
exchange your shares of Xilinx common stock for shares of AMD common stock. Such shares will, following
the effective time, be automatically exchanged for shares of AMD common stock (in book-entry form) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AMD common stock to which you are entitled. If you instead hold your
shares of Xilinx common stock in certificated form, then, after receiving the proper documentation from you
following the effective time, the exchange agent will deliver to you the shares of AMD common stock (in
book-entry form) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AMD common stock to which you are entitled.

At the effective time, each share of Xilinx common stock (other than shares held in treasury by Xilinx or held

awards on substantially the same terms, except that the assumed equity awards will cover a number of shares
of AMD common stock and, if applicable, have an exercise price determined using the exchange ratio and any
performance criteria applicable to Xilinx RSUs determined based on actual or, if consummation of the merger

up to an additional $40.0 million calculated based on the extent to which the value of Xilinx’s shares in the merger
immediately prior to closing (as measured by the trading price of the AMD common stock received in the merger)
exceeds a specified threshold. Based on the trading price of AMD common stock on March 4, 2021, the additional fee
payable to Morgan Stanley would be approximately $19 million. $5.0 million of the transaction fee was paid upon the

The AMD Special Meeting (Page 55)
In light of ongoing developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the AMD special meeting will be held
solely in a virtual meeting format via live webcast on April 7, 2021, beginning at 9:30 a.m., Pacific Time. AMD
stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting by visiting the AMD special
meeting website at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AMD2021SM.
The purposes of the AMD special meeting are as follows:
AMD Proposal 1: Approval of the Share Issuance. To consider and vote on the AMD share issuance
proposal; and
AMD Proposal 2: Adjournment of the AMD Special Meeting. To consider and vote on the AMD
adjournment proposal.
Completion of the merger is conditioned on the approval of the AMD share issuance proposal (AMD Proposal
1) by AMD stockholders.
Only holders of record of shares of AMD common stock outstanding as of the close of business on February
10, 2021 (the AMD record date) are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the AMD special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. AMD stockholders may cast one vote for each share of AMD common
stock that they own of record as of the AMD record date.
A quorum of AMD stockholders is necessary to hold the AMD special meeting. A quorum will exist at the
AMD special meeting if holders of record of shares of AMD common stock representing a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of AMD common stock entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting are
virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy. All shares of AMD common
stock represented by a valid proxy and all abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of establishing
a quorum. All of the proposals for consideration at the AMD special meeting are considered “non-routine”
matters under Nasdaq rules, and, therefore, brokers are not permitted to vote on any of the matters to be
considered at the AMD special meeting unless they have received instructions from the beneficial owners. As
a result, no “broker non-votes” are expected at the AMD special meeting, and shares held in “street name” will
not be counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the AMD
stockholder provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the
proposals brought before the AMD special meeting.
Assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD share issuance proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD
common

stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal. Accordingly, any shares not virtually
present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or
other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD share issuance proposal. An abstention or
other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special
meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the AMD share issuance proposal. However, assuming a quorum is present at the
AMD special meeting, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or
other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not for the AMD share
issuance proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld with respect to the AMD share issuance proposal
and such failure to provide voting instructions will have no effect on the AMD share issuance proposal.
Whether or not a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD
common stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD adjournment proposal. Accordingly, any shares not
virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD adjournment proposal. An abstention
or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the AMD
adjournment proposal to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD adjournment proposal will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the AMD adjournment proposal. However, if an AMD stockholder who
holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or
more other proposals, but not for the AMD adjournment proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld
with respect to the AMD adjournment proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will have no
effect on the AMD adjournment proposal.​
The Xilinx Special Meeting (Page 64)
In light of ongoing developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Xilinx special meeting will be held
virtually via live webcast on April 7, 2021, beginning at 9:30 a.m., Pacific Time. Xilinx stockholders will be able
to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting by visiting the Xilinx special meeting website at
https://viewproxy.com/Xilinx/2021.
The purposes of the Xilinx special meeting are as follows:
Xilinx Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement. To consider and vote on the Xilinx merger
proposal;
Xilinx Proposal 2: Approval, on an Advisory Non-Binding Basis, of Certain Merger-Related
Compensatory Arrangements with Xilinx Named Executive Officers. To consider and vote on the
Xilinx compensation proposal; and
Xilinx Proposal 3: Adjournment of the Xilinx Special Meeting. To consider and vote on the Xilinx
adjournment proposal.
Completion of the merger is conditioned on the approval of the Xilinx merger proposal (Xilinx Proposal 1) by
Xilinx stockholders. Approval of the advisory Xilinx compensation proposal (Xilinx Proposal 2) is not a
condition to the obligation of either AMD or Xilinx to complete the merger.
Only holders of record of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding as of the close of business on February
10, 2021 (the Xilinx record date) are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Xilinx special meeting or any
19 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
adjournment or postponement thereof. Xilinx stockholders may cast one vote for each share of Xilinx common
stock that they own of record as of the Xilinx record date.
A quorum of Xilinx stockholders is necessary to hold the Xilinx special meeting. A quorum will exist at the
Xilinx special meeting if holders of record of shares of Xilinx common stock representing a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting are
virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy. All shares of Xilinx common
stock represented by a valid proxy and all abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of establishing
a quorum. All of the proposals for consideration at the Xilinx special meeting are considered “non-routine”
matters under Nasdaq rules, and, therefore, brokers are not permitted to vote on any of the matters to be
considered at the Xilinx special meeting unless they have received instructions from the beneficial owners. As
a result, no “broker non-votes” are expected at the meeting, and shares held in “street name” will not be
counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the Xilinx stockholder
provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals brought
before the Xilinx special meeting.​
Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx merger proposal requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx merger proposal. Accordingly, an abstention or other
failure to vote on the Xilinx merger proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx merger
proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx compensation proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx
common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special
meeting, any shares not virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx
stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting
instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Xilinx
compensation proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx compensation proposal to vote on the Xilinx
compensation proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx compensation proposal. In
addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee
provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not for the Xilinx compensation proposal, it
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx compensation proposal.
Whether or not a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx
common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by
proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank,
broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no
effect on the outcome of the Xilinx adjournment proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares
virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx
adjournment proposal to vote on the Xilinx adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Xilinx adjournment proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in “street
name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals,
but not for the Xilinx adjournment proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx
adjournment proposal.

officers do not have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other
AMD stockholders generally. See “Interests of AMD Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Interests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 255)
In considering the recommendations of the Xilinx board of directors, Xilinx stockholders should be aware that
Xilinx directors and executive officers have interests in the merger, including financial interests, which may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Xilinx stockholders generally. The Xilinx board of
directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, when it determined that the
merger is fair to and in the best interests of Xilinx and its stockholders, approved and declared advisable the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and recommended that
Xilinx stockholders approve the Xilinx merger proposal. These interests are discussed in more detail under
“Interests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The benefits and financial interests that Xilinx’s directors and executive officers may become eligible to
receive as a result of their interests in the merger include:
Xilinx equity awards, including Xilinx Options and Xilinx RSUs, held by Xilinx executive officers will
be assumed by AMD and converted into AMD equity awards, with any performance criteria
applicable to AMD RSUs determined based on actual or, if consummation of the merger occurs during
or after Xilinx’s 2022 fiscal year, the greater of target-level and actual, performance through a date that
is at least ten business days prior to the effective time, the number and estimated value of which are
provided under “Interests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”;
the vesting of any Xilinx equity awards, including Xilinx Options and Xilinx RSUs, held by non-
employee members of the Xilinx board of directors will accelerate in full and, in the case of Xilinx
RSUs, become settled, the number and estimated value of which are provided under “Interests of
Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”;
the merger agreement provides that the directors and executive officers of Xilinx and its subsidiaries
will have the right to indemnification and continued coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies following the merger;
at least two members of the Xilinx board of directors will be added to the AMD board of directors at
the effective time; and
each of Xilinx’s current executive officers has entered into an employment or change of control
agreement with Xilinx, which, among other things, provides for severance payments and benefits
upon certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with a change of control of Xilinx.
For an estimate of the value of the benefits and financial interests that Xilinx’s named executive named officers
may become eligible to receive as a result of their interests in the merger, assuming, among other things, that
the merger was completed on February 10, 2021 and each such named executive officer experienced a
qualifying termination of employment immediately thereafter, see “Interests of Xilinx Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Xilinx Named Executive Officers-Golden
Parachute Compensation.”
Governance of the Combined Company (Page 159)
AMD has agreed to appoint at least two members of the Xilinx board of directors to the AMD board of
directors as of the effective time, with such directors to hold office until the earliest to occur of the
appointment or election and qualification of his or her respective successor or his or her death, resignation,
disqualification or proper removal. Each such director must qualify as an “independent director” under
applicable Nasdaq rules and regulations and will be designated by the AMD board of directors after
reasonable consultation with, and
21 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reasonable consideration of, the recommendations of Xilinx. AMD has agreed to nominate such directors for
reelection at the first annual meeting of AMD stockholders that occurs after the closing.
Dr. Lisa Su will lead the combined company as Chief Executive Officer. Victor Peng, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Xilinx, will join AMD as President responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth
initiatives, effective upon closing of the merger.
Organizational Documents and Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation (Page 159)
At the effective time, Xilinx’s certificate of incorporation will be amended and restated in its entirety to read as
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub. The parties to the merger agreement will also take all requisite
actions to amend the bylaws of Xilinx to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub except that the name of the
surviving corporation will be “Xilinx, Inc.” and Article VI of the Xilinx bylaws will remain in effect as Article VI
of the surviving corporation. Merger Sub’s directors and officers immediately prior to the effective time will
become the initial directors and officers of Xilinx as the surviving corporation.
Certain Beneficial Owners of AMD Common Stock (Page 276)
At the close of business on February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, AMD directors and executive officers and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were
entitled to vote approximately 1% of the shares of AMD common stock outstanding on such date. Although
none of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, AMD currently expects that all AMD
directors and executive officers will vote their shares “FOR” the AMD share issuance proposal and “FOR” the
AMD adjournment proposal. For more information regarding the security ownership of AMD directors and
executive officers, see “Certain Beneficial Owners of AMD Common Stock-Security Ownership of AMD
Directors and Executive Officers.”​
Certain Beneficial Owners of Xilinx Common Stock (Page 278)
At the close of business on February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Xilinx directors and executive officers and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were
entitled to vote less than 1% of the shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding on such date. Although none
of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, Xilinx currently expects that all Xilinx
directors and executive officers will vote their shares “FOR” the Xilinx merger proposal, “FOR” the Xilinx
compensation proposal and “FOR” the Xilinx adjournment proposal. For more information regarding the
security ownership of Xilinx directors and executive officers, see “Certain Beneficial Owners of Xilinx Common
Stock-Security Ownership of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers.”
Regulatory Approvals (Page 149)
AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have each agreed to cooperate with each other and to use (and to cause their
subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary to cause the conditions to the closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than the end date) and to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including to obtain all required regulatory approvals as
promptly as practicable, subject to certain limits. See “The Merger-Regulatory Approvals.”
The obligations of AMD and Xilinx to consummate the merger are subject to, among other conditions, the
termination or expiration of any waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement under the HSR Act, which occurred as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on
January 11, 2021, and the receipt of any approvals and clearances required in connection with such
transactions under the competition laws of the European Union, China, the United Kingdom and certain
additional jurisdictions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ownership of the Combined Company (Page 150)
Based on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock outstanding as of February 10, 2021, the
latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, upon completion of the
merger, former Xilinx stockholders are expected to own approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of
AMD common stock and AMD stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own
approximately 74.1% of the outstanding shares of AMD common stock. The relative ownership interests of
AMD stockholders and former Xilinx stockholders in the combined company immediately following the merger
will depend on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the merger.
No Appraisal Rights (Page 274)
Neither AMD nor Xilinx stockholders are entitled to appraisal of their shares or dissenters’ rights with respect
to the merger.
Conditions to the Completion of the Merger (Page 174)
The obligations of each of AMD and Xilinx to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver, in
whole or in part (to the extent permitted by applicable law), at or prior to the closing, of each of the following
conditions:
the SEC having declared effective the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, and the absence of any stop order or pending (or threatened)
proceedings by the SEC with respect thereto;
approval by Xilinx stockholders of the Xilinx merger proposal;
approval by AMD stockholders of the AMD share issuance proposal;
the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR
Act, which occurred as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 11, 2021, and the receipt of the other
specified regulatory clearances and approvals;
the approval for listing by Nasdaq of the shares of AMD common stock to be issued to Xilinx
stockholders in the merger, including shares of AMD common stock to be issued in connection with
assumed Xilinx equity awards; and
the absence of any law or order by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction preventing,
enjoining or making illegal the consummation of the merger.
In addition, each party’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to, among other things, the accuracy of
certain representations and warranties of the other party and the compliance by such other party with certain
of its covenants, in each case, subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement, and the
absence of the occurrence of any material adverse effect.
Neither AMD nor Xilinx can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or
that the merger will be completed.
No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals (Page 165)
As more fully described under “The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals,” subject to
the exceptions summarized below, AMD and Xilinx have each agreed that they will not (a) solicit, initiate,
23 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the submission or announcement by
any person of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal (as defined under “The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”),
(b) furnish any information regarding such party or its subsidiaries or afford access to such party’s or its
subsidiaries’ representatives, books, records or property, in each case in connection with, or for the purpose
of soliciting, initiating, encouraging or facilitating, or in response to, any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, (c) engage in, enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any
acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal, (d) approve, adopt, recommend, agree to or enter into, or propose to approve, adopt,
recommend, agree to or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar document,
agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any acquisition proposal or (e) resolve or
agree to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining approval of the Xilinx
merger proposal, in the case of Xilinx, or the AMD share issuance proposal, in the case of AMD, AMD or
Xilinx, as applicable, receives a bona fide, written acquisition proposal after the date of the merger agreement
that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement and that the AMD
or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as
defined under “The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”) and that failure to engage in
such discussions or negotiations, or provide such information, would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with such board of directors’ fiduciary duties to such party and its stockholders under applicable
legal requirements, AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, may (a) engage in discussions or negotiations with the party
making the acquisition proposal and (b) furnish information with respect to AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, to
the party making the acquisition proposal, in either case, subject to certain conditions and obligations in the
merger agreement.​
AMD and Xilinx have also agreed to notify the other (a) promptly following (and in any event, within 24 hours
of the receipt of) any acquisition proposal or any request for information that is reasonably likely to lead to an
acquisition proposal and (b) to keep the other party reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event,
within 24 hours) as to the status of any acquisition proposal, including informing the other party of any
material change to such acquisition proposal’s terms, the status of any negotiations, and any change in its
intentions.
No Change of Recommendation (Page 168)
The merger agreement provides that, among other restrictions and subject to certain exceptions, neither the
AMD nor Xilinx board of directors will (a) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify (or publicly propose
to do so), in a manner adverse the other party, the AMD board of directors’ recommendation to AMD
stockholders to approve the share issuance or the Xilinx board of directors’ recommendation to Xilinx
stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, as applicable, or (b) approve, recommend or declare advisable (or
publicly propose to do so) any acquisition proposal.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to obtaining the approval by AMD
stockholders of the AMD share issuance proposal or by Xilinx stockholders of the Xilinx merger proposal, as
the case may be, the AMD or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, may make a change of recommendation
and/or terminate the merger agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an
acquisition proposal if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisor) that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal and that failure to take such action
with respect to such acquisition proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the such
board of directors’ fiduciary duties to such party and its stockholders under applicable legal requirements
(and subject to compliance with certain obligations set forth in the merger agreement, including providing the
other party with prior notice and
24 
• 
•

• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the opportunity to negotiate for a period to match the terms of the superior proposal and payment of the
applicable termination fee concurrent with any such termination of the merger agreement).
In addition, the AMD or Xilinx board of directors, as the case may be, is permitted under certain
circumstances, prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the AMD share issuance proposal, in the case of
AMD, or the Xilinx merger proposal, in the case of Xilinx, and subject to compliance with certain obligations
set forth in the merger agreement (including providing the other party with prior notice and the opportunity to
negotiate during such notice period to amend the terms of the merger agreement) to make a change of
recommendation in response to an intervening event (unrelated to an acquisition proposal) if the AMD or
Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties.
Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 176)
The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned:
by mutual written consent of AMD and Xilinx at any time prior to the effective time;
by either AMD or Xilinx, if the merger has not been consummated on or prior to the end date,
including any automatic extensions thereof (however, a party may not terminate the merger agreement
if such party’s material breach of any of its obligations under the merger agreement materially
contributed to the failure of the closing to have occurred by the end date);
by either AMD or Xilinx, if a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction issues a final and non-
appealable order or adopts or enacts a law that is final and non-appealable that permanently prevents,
enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the merger (however, a party may not terminate the
merger agreement if such party has failed in any material respect to comply with any of its obligations
under the merger agreement with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals);
by either party, if the other party has made a change of recommendation, prior to the other party
obtaining its required stockholder approval;
by either party, if either the Xilinx merger proposal or the AMD share issuance proposal is not
approved at the Xilinx special meeting or the AMD special meeting, respectively, including any
postponement or adjournment thereof;
by either party, if prior to obtaining such party’s stockholder approval, (a) such party’s board of
directors shall have authorized the party to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior
proposal, (b) concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement, such party enters into the
definitive agreement relating to a superior proposal and pays the other party the applicable
termination fee pursuant to the merger agreement, and (c) such party has otherwise complied in all
respects (other than de minimis noncompliance unrelated to such superior proposal) with the
applicable no solicitation of acquisition proposals and special meetings provisions of the merger
agreement; or
by either party, if any representation or warranty of the other party becomes inaccurate or the other
party breaches any covenant in the merger agreement and such inaccuracy or breach (a) would result
in the failure of certain conditions to closing and (b) is not curable by the end date or, if curable and
the other party is using reasonable best efforts to cure, is not cured by the date that is 30 days
following written notice describing such breach (however, the terminating party may not exercise this
termination right if it is then in breach of any representation, warranty or agreement contained in the
merger agreement which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to the merger agreement
regarding accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants).
25 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Termination Fees (Page 177)
Xilinx has agreed to pay a termination fee of $1.0 billion in cash to AMD, and AMD has agreed to pay a
termination fee of $1.5 billion in cash to Xilinx (together, the “termination fees”), if the merger agreement is
terminated in certain circumstances involving a change of recommendation or termination of the merger
agreement to enter into a superior proposal, in each case by the party obligated to pay the fee. AMD and
Xilinx are also required to pay the applicable termination fee if the party obligated to pay the termination fee
enters into or consummates a superior proposal following certain terminations of the merger agreement,
including a termination due to such party’s failure to obtain the required stockholder approval, after an
alternative proposal has been made or due to a breach of such party’s non-solicitation obligations under the
merger agreement.
AMD must pay a regulatory termination fee of $1.0 billion in cash to Xilinx if the merger agreement is
terminated in certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals.
Neither AMD nor Xilinx will be required to pay a termination fee on more than one occasion. Furthermore,
except in the case of fraud or intentional and material breach of the merger agreement, if a party receives a
termination fee, then the termination fee will be the recipient’s sole and exclusive remedy against the other
party, its affiliates and its and their respective representatives in connection with the merger agreement.
A termination fee will be payable by a party only once and not in duplication even though the termination fee
may be payable by such party pursuant to multiple circumstances.
Accounting Treatment (Page 151)
AMD prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805,
Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. AMD will
record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their
respective fair values at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described
in Note 2 (Basis of Pro Forma Presentation) to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements) over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.
The financial condition and results of operations of AMD after completion of the merger will reflect Xilinx after
completion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or
results of operations of Xilinx. The earnings of AMD following completion of the merger will reflect
acquisition accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value for assets and
liabilities on depreciation expense and amortization expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including
goodwill, will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and
intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the
future, AMD determines that tangible or intangible assets (including goodwill) are impaired, AMD would
record an impairment charge at that time.
Litigation Relating to the Merger (Page 151)
As of March 4, 2021, nine complaints have been filed by purported Xilinx stockholders and one complaint has
been filed by a purported AMD stockholder, each of which seeks to enjoin the merger and other relief. The
complaints assert claims against certain defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder for allegedly false and misleading statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and against certain defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged “control person” liability
with respect to such allegedly false and misleading statements. Two complaints assert that the members of the
Xilinx board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger by purportedly failing to
obtain​
26 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
adequate consideration and failing to disclose material information about the merger, and one complaint
asserts that the members of the Xilinx board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the
merger by purportedly failing to obtain adequate consideration, and that AMD, Xilinx and Merger Sub aided
and abetted the Xilinx board of directors’ breach. AMD and Xilinx believe the allegations in the complaints are
without merit. See “The Merger-Litigation Relating to the Merger.”
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 262)
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming the merger so qualifies, a U.S. Holder (as defined under
“U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) of Xilinx common stock generally will not recognize
any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of Xilinx common stock for AMD
common stock in the merger, except with respect to cash received by Xilinx stockholders in lieu of fractional
shares of AMD common stock.
See “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a more complete description of certain U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger. Please consult your tax advisors as to the specific tax
consequences to you of the merger.
Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights (Page 265)
Upon completion of the merger, Xilinx stockholders receiving shares of AMD common stock will become AMD
stockholders. The rights of AMD stockholders will be governed by the DGCL and the AMD charter and
bylaws in effect at the effective time. As AMD and Xilinx are both Delaware corporations, the rights of AMD
and Xilinx stockholders are not materially different. However, there are certain differences in the rights of
AMD stockholders under the AMD charter and bylaws and of Xilinx stockholders under the Xilinx charter and
bylaws. See “Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights.”
Listing of AMD Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of Xilinx Common Stock (Page 153)
It is a condition to the merger that the shares of AMD common stock to be issued to Xilinx stockholders in the
merger be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance. If the merger is completed,
Xilinx common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, following which
Xilinx will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Xilinx common stock.
Xilinx has agreed to cooperate with AMD prior to the closing to cause the Xilinx common stock to be delisted
from Nasdaq and be deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the effective time.
Risk Factors (Page 37)

The registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, the
documents that AMD and Xilinx refer you to in the registration statement and oral statements made or to be
made by AMD and Xilinx include certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to
the safe harbor created by, Section 27A of the Securities Act, Section 21E of the Exchange Act and the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are referred to as the “safe harbor provisions.” Statements
contained or incorporated by reference in the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including
statements about the beliefs and expectations of AMD and Xilinx management relating to the merger and
future financial condition and performance. Words such as “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intends,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “would” or the negative
thereof and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements that are intended to
be covered by the safe harbor provisions. Investors are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are
subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of both
companies, and which may cause actual results and future trends to differ materially from those matters
expressed in, or implied or projected by, such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Although these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions
that AMD and Xilinx management, as applicable, believe to be reasonable, they can give no assurance that
these expectations will prove to be correct. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from
those described in forward-looking statements are the following:
the occurrence of any change, event, series of events or circumstances that could give rise to the
termination of the merger agreement, including a termination of the merger agreement under
circumstances that could require AMD to pay a termination fee to Xilinx or require Xilinx to pay a
termination fee to AMD;
uncertainties related to the timing of the receipt of required regulatory approvals for the merger and
the possibility that AMD and Xilinx may be required to accept conditions that could reduce or
eliminate the anticipated benefits of the merger as a condition to obtaining regulatory approvals or
that the required regulatory approvals might not be obtained at all;
the price of AMD and Xilinx common stock could change before the completion of the merger,
including as a result of uncertainty as to the long-term value of the common stock of the combined
company or as a result of broader stock market movements;
the possibility that the parties are unable to complete the merger due to the failure of AMD
stockholders to approve the share issuance or of Xilinx stockholders to adopt the merger agreement,
or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions to the completion of the merger, or unexpected
delays in satisfying any conditions;
delays in closing, or the failure to close, the merger for any reason, could negatively impact AMD,
Xilinx or the combined company;
risks that the pendency or completion of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement disrupt current plans and operations, which may adversely impact AMD’s or
Xilinx’s respective businesses;
difficulties or delays in integrating the businesses of AMD and Xilinx following completion of the
merger or fully realizing the anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from the merger;
certain restrictions during the pendency of the proposed merger that may impact the ability of AMD
or Xilinx to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions;
the risk of legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against AMD, Xilinx, their directors
and/or others relating to the merger;

an adverse effect on the ability of AMD or Xilinx to retain and hire key personnel or maintain
relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors, strategic partners or other third

In considering how to vote on the proposals to be considered and voted on at the AMD and Xilinx special
meetings, you are urged to carefully consider all of the information contained or incorporated by reference
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” You should also read
and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of AMD and Xilinx because those risks will
affect the combined company. The risks associated with the business of AMD can be found in AMD’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and the risks associated with the business
of Xilinx can be found in Xilinx’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 28, 2020, as
such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company’s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (excluding any information and exhibits furnished under Item
2.02 or 7.01 thereof), each of which is incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In
addition, you are urged to carefully consider the following material risks relating to the merger and the
businesses of AMD, Xilinx and the combined company.
Risks Relating to the Merger
Because the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the price of either AMD or
Xilinx common stock, the value of the consideration that Xilinx stockholders will receive in the merger is uncertain.
Upon completion of the merger, each share of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
merger, other than shares held in treasury by Xilinx or held directly by AMD or Merger Sub, will be converted
into the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock (with cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes, in lieu of any fractional shares of AMD common stock). This exchange ratio is
fixed in the merger agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either AMD or Xilinx
common stock prior to the completion of the merger. The market prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock have
fluctuated prior to and after the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to
fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the dates of the AMD and Xilinx special
meetings, and through the date the merger is consummated.
Because the value of the merger consideration will depend on the market price of AMD common stock at the
time the merger is completed, Xilinx stockholders will not know or be able to determine at the time of the Xilinx
special meeting the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the
merger. Similarly, AMD stockholders will not know or be able to determine at the time of the AMD special
meeting the market value of the shares of AMD common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement
compared to the market value of the shares of Xilinx common stock that are being exchanged in the merger.
Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and
economic conditions, changes in AMD’s or Xilinx’s respective businesses, operations and prospects, the
uncertainty as to the extent of the duration, scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market assessments
of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, interest rates, general market, industry and economic
conditions and other factors generally affecting the respective prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock,
federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments
in which AMD and Xilinx operate, and the timing of the merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals.
Many of these factors are beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, and neither AMD nor Xilinx is permitted to
terminate the merger agreement solely due to a decline in the market price of the common stock of the other
party. You are urged to obtain current market quotations for AMD and Xilinx common stock in determining
whether to vote in favor of the AMD share issuance proposal, in the case of AMD stockholders, or the Xilinx
merger proposal, in the case of Xilinx stockholders.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The market price of AMD common stock will continue to fluctuate after the merger.
Upon completion of the merger, Xilinx stockholders will become holders of AMD common stock. The market
price of the common stock of the combined company will continue to fluctuate, potentially significantly,
following completion of the merger, including for the reasons described above. As a result, former Xilinx
stockholders could lose some or all of the value of their investment in AMD common stock. In addition, any
significant price or volume fluctuations in the stock market generally could have a material adverse effect on
the market for, or liquidity of, the AMD common stock received in the merger, regardless of the combined
company’s actual operating performance.
The merger may not be completed and the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.
The merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied, including the approval by AMD
stockholders of the AMD share issuance proposal and approval by Xilinx stockholders of the Xilinx merger
proposal, or waived (to the extent permitted), in each case prior to the completion of the merger. These
conditions are described under “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.” These
conditions to the completion of the merger, some of which are beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, may not
be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or not
completed.
Additionally, either AMD or Xilinx may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances,
including, among other reasons, if the merger is not completed by the end date. In addition, if the merger
agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, including if the Xilinx board of directors changes its
recommendation, Xilinx may be required to pay AMD a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement
is terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required regulatory
approvals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement is
terminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes its
recommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. See “The Merger
Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees” for a more
complete discussion of the circumstances under which the merger agreement could be terminated and when a
termination fee may be payable by AMD or Xilinx.
The termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact AMD or Xilinx and the trading prices of the AMD
or Xilinx common stock.
If the merger is not completed for any reason, including because AMD stockholders fail to approve the AMD
share issuance proposal or because Xilinx stockholders fail to approve the Xilinx merger proposal, the
ongoing businesses of AMD and Xilinx may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected
benefits of having completed the merger, AMD and Xilinx would be subject to a number of risks, including the
following:
each company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative
impacts on its stock price;
each company may experience negative reactions from its customers, suppliers, distributors and
employees;
each company will be required to pay its respective costs relating to the merger, such as financial
advisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the
merger is completed;
the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of each company’s business prior to
completion of the merger and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the
other company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), which may have prevented
AMD and Xilinx from taking actions during the pendency of the merger that would have been
beneficial (see “The Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business Prior to the Merger’s Completion” for a
description of the restrictive covenants applicable to AMD and Xilinx); and
38 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of
time and resources by AMD and Xilinx management, which could otherwise have been devoted to
day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to AMD or Xilinx, as
applicable, as an independent company.
The market price for shares of AMD common stock may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those
that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock.
Upon consummation of the merger, AMD stockholders and Xilinx stockholders will both hold shares of
common stock in the combined company. AMD’s businesses differ from those of Xilinx, and Xilinx’s
businesses differ from those of AMD, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company
will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently or historically affecting the results of
operations of AMD and Xilinx. The results of operations of the combined company may also be affected by
factors different from those that currently affect or have historically affected either AMD or Xilinx. For a
discussion of the businesses of each of AMD and Xilinx and some important factors to consider in connection
with those businesses, see “The Parties to the Merger” and the other information contained or incorporated in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Based on the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding as of February 10, 2021, the latest
practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, it is expected that AMD will issue
approximately 423.6 million shares of AMD common stock in the merger. Former Xilinx stockholders may
decide not to hold the shares of AMD common stock that they will receive in the merger, and AMD
stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in AMD as a result of the changes to AMD’s investment
profile as a result of the merger. Other Xilinx stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted
holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of AMD common stock that they
receive in the merger. Such sales of AMD common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price
for AMD common stock.
The shares of common stock of the combined company to be received by Xilinx stockholders as a result of the merger
will have rights different from the shares of Xilinx common stock.
Upon completion of the merger, Xilinx stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Xilinx, but will instead
become stockholders of AMD. As AMD and Xilinx are both Delaware corporations, the rights of AMD and
Xilinx stockholders are not materially different. However, there are certain differences in the rights of AMD
stockholders under AMD’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which is referred to as the
“AMD charter,” and AMD’s amended and restated bylaws, which are referred to as the “AMD bylaws,” and
of Xilinx stockholders under Xilinx’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which is referred to as
the “Xilinx charter,” and Xilinx’s amended and restated bylaws, which are referred to as the “Xilinx bylaws.”
See “Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights” for a discussion of these rights.
After the merger, Xilinx stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in AMD than they
currently have in Xilinx and will exercise less influence over management and policies of the combined company.
Based on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock outstanding on February 10, 2021, the latest
practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, upon completion of the merger,
former Xilinx stockholders are expected to own approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of AMD
common stock and AMD stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately
74.1% of the outstanding shares of AMD common stock. Consequently, former Xilinx stockholders will have
less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over the
management and policies of Xilinx.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Until the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, AMD and
Xilinx are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be
beneficial to AMD, Xilinx and/or their respective stockholders.
From and after the date of the merger agreement and prior to completion of the merger, the merger agreement
restricts AMD and Xilinx from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party and requires
that the business of each company and its respective subsidiaries be conducted in the ordinary course in all
material respects. These restrictions may prevent AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, from taking actions during the
pendency of the merger that would have been beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these restrictions
during the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or
termination of the merger agreement. See “The Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business Prior to the Merger’s
Completion.”
Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the merger.
The merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the merger agreement. These closing
conditions include, among others, the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this
joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part registering the AMD common stock issuable pursuant to the
merger agreement and the absence of any stop order or proceedings by the SEC with respect thereto, the
expiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof), and the receipt of
required approvals, under U.S. and certain foreign competition laws, approval for listing on Nasdaq of the
shares of AMD common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement, and the absence of
governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the merger. To the extent required,
foreign investment filings will also be made, though these are not closing conditions. The obligation of each
of AMD and Xilinx to consummate the merger is also conditioned on, among other things, the truth and
accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the other party on the date of the merger agreement
and on the closing date (subject to certain materiality and material adverse effect qualifiers), and the
performance by the other party in all material respects of its obligations under the merger agreement. No
assurance can be given that the required stockholder, governmental and regulatory consents and approvals
will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and
approvals are obtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms,
conditions and timing of such consents and approvals. Any delay in completing the merger could cause the
combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that AMD and Xilinx
expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame. For a more complete
summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to completion of the merger, see “The Merger
Agreement-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.”
AMD and Xilinx must obtain certain regulatory approvals and clearances to consummate the merger, which, if
delayed, not granted or granted with burdensome or unacceptable conditions, could prevent, substantially delay or
impair consummation of the merger, result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the
anticipated benefits of the merger.
The completion of the merger is subject to the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period (or
extension thereof) under the HSR Act, which occurred as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 11, 2021, and
the receipt of the other specified regulatory clearances and approvals, including antitrust authorizations or
approvals in the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and certain additional jurisdictions. These
jurisdictions can also impose conditions on case approval under the applicable competition laws as they deem
necessary or desirable, including, but not limited to, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or
requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or to not engage in certain types of conduct.
United States. With respect to the United States, under the HSR Act, the merger may not be completed until
Notification and Report Forms have been filed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is referred to as
40 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the “FTC,” and the U.S. Department of Justice, which is referred to as the “DOJ,” and the applicable waiting
period (or any extension thereof) has expired or been terminated. A transaction requiring notification under the
HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of the applicable 30-day waiting period following the
parties’ filing of their respective HSR notifications or the early termination of that waiting period, at the
earliest. Each of AMD and Xilinx filed an HSR notification with the FTC and the DOJ on November 9, 2020, and
AMD withdrew and resubmitted its notification form on December 11, 2020. Effective as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern
Time, on January 11, 2021, the waiting period under the HSR Act expired with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC, or any state, could take such action under
competition laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to
license, or hold separate, assets or to terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Under certain
circumstances, private parties may also seek to take legal action against the merger under competition laws.
European Union. Both AMD and Xilinx conduct business across the European Union in multiple Member
States. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, which is referred to as the “EU Merger Regulation,” mergers and
acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and individual European Union sales exceeding specified
thresholds must be notified to, and approved by, the European Commission before they are implemented.
AMD and Xilinx meet the thresholds set out in the EU Merger Regulation and are therefore obliged to (i)
notify the European Commission of AMD’s proposed acquisition of Xilinx and (ii) wait to implement the
merger until after the European Commission has issued a decision declaring the merger compatible with the
common market (and/or if the European Commission has referred any aspect of the merger to one or more
competent authorities of a European Union member state under Article 9 of the EU Merger Regulation or an
EFTA state under Article 6 of Protocol 24 to the EEA Agreement, until each competent authority has issued a
clearance or a confirmation that the merger may proceed). As is customary, AMD and Xilinx have begun pre-
notification consultations with the European Commission and intend to file a formal notification as soon as is
reasonably possible.
United Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, the parties intend to notify the merger to the
Competition and Markets Authority, which is referred to as the “CMA,” under the Enterprise Act 2002. The
CMA may issue an order that, among other things, prevents the completion of the merger or prevents the
integration of the parties’ businesses. The practical effect of this is typically that the merger may not be
completed until the merger has been notified to the CMA and the merging parties have obtained clearance.
AMD and Xilinx have begun pre-notification discussions with the CMA and will file a formal notification as
soon as is reasonably practicable.
China. Under the Antimonopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, which is referred to as the “AML,”
transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue levels cannot be completed until they are
reviewed and approved by the State Administration of Market Regulation, which is referred to as “SAMR.”
AMD and Xilinx have sufficient revenues to exceed SAMR’s statutory thresholds for review, and completion
of the merger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR approval. AMD and Xilinx expect to submit a draft
notification to SAMR.
The merger is also subject to clearance or approval by competition authorities in certain other jurisdictions.
The merger cannot be completed until AMD and Xilinx obtain clearance to consummate the merger or
applicable waiting periods (or any extension thereof) have expired or been terminated in each applicable
jurisdiction. AMD and Xilinx, in consultation and cooperation with each other, will file notifications, as
required by competition authorities in certain other jurisdictions, as promptly as practicable after the date of
the merger agreement. The relevant competition authorities could take such actions under applicable
competition laws as they deem
41 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the
parties to license, or hold separate, assets or to terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Any
one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the
completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the merger. There is no assurance that AMD and Xilinx will
obtain all required regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to obtain the
necessary clearances in any of these jurisdictions could substantially delay or prevent the consummation of
the merger, which could negatively impact both AMD and Xilinx.
Failure to attract, motivate and retain executives and other key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of
the merger.
The success of the merger will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to retain the talents and
dedication of the professionals currently employed by AMD and Xilinx. It is possible that these employees
may decide not to remain with AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, while the merger is pending, or with the combined
company. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained
to maintain effective operations, the combined company’s business activities may be adversely affected and
management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating AMD and Xilinx to hiring suitable
replacements, all of which may cause the combined company’s business to suffer. In addition, AMD and Xilinx
may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees that leave either company or offer
employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. In addition, there could be disruptions to or
distractions for the workforce and management, including disruptions associated with integrating employees
into the combined company. No assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or
retain key employees of AMD and Xilinx to the same extent that those companies have been able to attract or
retain their own employees in the past.
The merger, and uncertainty regarding the merger, may cause customers, suppliers, distributors or strategic partners
to delay or defer decisions concerning AMD or Xilinx and adversely affect each company’s ability to effectively
manage its respective business.
The merger will happen only if the stated conditions are met, including the approval of the AMD share
issuance proposal, the approval of the Xilinx merger proposal and the receipt of required regulatory approvals,
among other conditions. Many of the conditions are beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, and both parties
also have certain rights to terminate the merger agreement. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding
the completion of the merger. This uncertainty may cause customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors,
strategic partners or others that deal with AMD or Xilinx to delay or defer entering into contracts with AMD
or Xilinx or making other decisions concerning AMD or Xilinx or seek to change or cancel existing business
relationships with AMD or Xilinx, which could negatively affect their respective businesses. Any delay or
deferral of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could have an adverse impact on the respective
businesses of AMD and Xilinx, regardless of whether the merger is ultimately completed.
In addition, the merger agreement restricts AMD, Xilinx and their respective subsidiaries from taking certain
actions during the pendency of the merger without the consent of the other parties. These restrictions may
prevent AMD and Xilinx from pursuing attractive business opportunities or strategic transactions that may
arise prior to the completion of the merger. See “The Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business Prior to the
Merger’s Completion” for a description of the restrictive covenants to which each of AMD and Xilinx is
subject.
The opinions rendered to AMD and Xilinx from their respective financial advisors will not reflect changes in
circumstances between the dates of such opinions and the completion of the merger.
DBO and Credit Suisse delivered their oral opinions to the AMD board of directors on October 26, 2020, which
opinions were subsequently confirmed in a written opinion from each of DBO and Credit Suisse dated as of
October 26, 2020, to the effect that as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made,
42 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered in connection with the
preparation of each opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to AMD.
Morgan Stanley delivered its oral opinion to the Xilinx board of directors on October 26, 2020, which opinion
was subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated as of October 26, 2020, that as of such date and based
upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken as set forth in the written opinion, the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Xilinx common stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares).
BofA Securities delivered its oral opinion to the Xilinx board of directors on October 26, 2020, which opinion
was subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated as of October 26, 2020, that as of such date and based
upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken as set forth in the written opinion, the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Xilinx
common stock.
Neither AMD nor Xilinx has obtained, nor will either of them obtain, an updated opinion from DBO, Credit
Suisse, Morgan Stanley or BofA Securities, as applicable, regarding the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the exchange ratio, including as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or of the special
meetings, or prior to the completion of the merger. Each of the respective opinions of DBO, Credit Suisse,
Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities was necessarily based on general financial, economic, monetary, market
and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to DBO, Credit
Suisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, as applicable, only as of the dates of the respective opinions of
DBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, and such opinions do not address the fairness of
the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, at the time the merger is completed. Changes in the
operations and prospects of AMD or Xilinx, general financial, economic, monetary, market and other
conditions, circumstances and factors that may be beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, and on which each
of the respective opinions of DBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities was based, may alter
the value of AMD or Xilinx or the prices of shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock by the time the merger is
completed. The opinions of DBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities do not speak as of any
date other than the respective dates of such opinions. The recommendation of the AMD board of directors
that AMD stockholders vote “FOR” the AMD share issuance proposal and “FOR” the AMD adjournment
proposal and the recommendation of the Xilinx board of directors that Xilinx stockholders vote “FOR” the
Xilinx merger proposal, “FOR” the Xilinx compensation proposal and “FOR” the Xilinx adjournment proposal
are each made as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinions that
AMD and Xilinx received from their respective financial advisors, see “The Merger-Opinions of AMD’s
Financial Advisors” and “The Merger-​Opinion of Xilinx’s Financial Advisors.”
Whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in the
businesses of AMD and Xilinx, which could have an adverse effect on their respective businesses and financial results.
Whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause
disruptions in the businesses of AMD and Xilinx, including by diverting the attention of AMD and Xilinx
management toward the completion of the merger. In addition, AMD and Xilinx have each diverted significant
management resources in an effort to complete the merger and are each subject to restrictions contained in the
merger agreement on the conduct of their respective businesses. If the merger is not completed, AMD and
Xilinx will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which they
will have received little or no benefit.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Xilinx directors and executive officers have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to,
those of Xilinx stockholders generally.
When considering the recommendations of the Xilinx board of directors on how to vote on the proposals
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Xilinx stockholders should be aware that Xilinx directors
and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Xilinx
stockholders generally. These interests include the continued service of certain Xilinx directors as directors of
the combined company, the treatment in the merger of outstanding equity, equity-based and incentive awards,
severance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements, and the right to continued
indemnification of former Xilinx directors and officers by the combined company.
Xilinx stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider the recommendations of the Xilinx
board of directors that they vote to approve the Xilinx merger proposal. The Xilinx board of directors was
aware of and considered these interests when it determined that the merger was fair to and in the best
interests of Xilinx and its stockholders, approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, and
recommended that Xilinx stockholders adopt the merger agreement. The interests of Xilinx directors and
executive officers are described in more detail under “Interests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.”
AMD or Xilinx may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.
To the extent permitted by law, AMD or Xilinx may determine to waive, in whole or part, one or more of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the merger. AMD and Xilinx currently expect to
evaluate the materiality of any waiver and its effect on AMD or Xilinx stockholders, as applicable, in light of
the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies is required in light of such waiver. Any determination as
to whether to waive any condition to the merger, and as to whether to re-solicit stockholder approval and/or
amend this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a result of such waiver, will be made by AMD or Xilinx, as
applicable, at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.
The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be
willing to pay more to acquire or merge with either AMD or Xilinx.
The merger agreement contains “no shop” provisions that restrict the ability of AMD and Xilinx to, among
other things (each as described under “The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”):
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the
submission or announcement by any person of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
furnish any information regarding AMD, Xilinx or their respective subsidiaries in connection with, for
the purpose of soliciting, initiating, encouraging or facilitating, or in response to, an acquisition
proposal;
engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to
any acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an acquisition proposal; or
approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, any
letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle with respect to
any acquisition proposal.
Furthermore, there are only limited exceptions to the requirement under the merger agreement that neither the
AMD nor Xilinx boards of directors withdraw, modify, amend or qualify the AMD recommendation or the

Xilinx recommendation, as applicable (each as defined under “The Merger Agreement-Representations and
Warranties”). Although the AMD or Xilinx board of directors is permitted to effect a change of
recommendation, after complying with certain procedures set forth in the merger agreement, in response to a
superior proposal or to an intervening event (if the applicable board of directors determines in good faith that
a failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law),
such change of recommendation would entitle the other party to terminate the merger agreement and collect a
termination fee from the party making a change of recommendation. See “The Merger Agreement-Termination
of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees.”
These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer from considering or proposing an
acquisition or merger, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than that implied by
the exchange ratio in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per
share price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee.
The merger will involve substantial costs.
AMD and Xilinx have incurred and expect to incur non-recurring costs associated with combining the
operations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. As of the
date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AMD and Xilinx estimate that their aggregate costs associated
with the merger and related transactions will be approximately $80 million and $138 million, respectively. These
costs include filing and registration fees with the SEC, printing and mailing costs associated with this joint
proxy/registration statement, and legal, accounting, investment banking, consulting, public relations and
proxy solicitation fees. These costs do not include severance and retention payments that may be made to
certain Xilinx employees and costs that will be incurred in connection with the integration of AMD’s and
Xilinx’s businesses. Some of these costs are payable by AMD or Xilinx regardless of whether the merger is
completed.
The combined company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger. The
costs related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either AMD or
the combined company. There are processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that
must be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of Xilinx’s business. Although AMD
expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the
realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction,
merger-related and restructuring costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.
Many of these costs will be borne by AMD even if the merger is not completed. While AMD has assumed that
certain expenses would be incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, there are many factors beyond AMD’s control that could affect the total amount or the
timing of the integration and implementation expenses.
AMD and Xilinx stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders of a corporation to
dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that such corporation pay the fair
value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration
offered to such stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the DGCL, stockholders
generally do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold are either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are
available if stockholders are required by the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares anything
other than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that will
either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash in lieu
of fractional shares or (d) any combination of the foregoing.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Because the merger is of Merger Sub with and into Xilinx and holders of AMD common stock will continue to
hold their shares following completion of the merger, holders of AMD common stock are not entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger.
Because AMD common stock is listed on Nasdaq, a national securities exchange, and because Xilinx
stockholders are not required by the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares of Xilinx common
stock anything other than shares of AMD common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, holders of
Xilinx common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. See “No Appraisal
Rights.”
Lawsuits filed against AMD and/or Xilinx may delay or prevent the merger from being completed.
AMD, Xilinx and members of the AMD and Xilinx boards of directors currently are and may in the future be
parties, among others, to various claims and litigation related to the merger agreement and the merger,
including putative shareholder class actions. See “The Merger-Litigation Relating to the Merger.” Among
other remedies, the plaintiffs in such matters are seeking to enjoin the merger. The results of complex legal
proceedings are difficult to predict, and could prevent or delay the merger from being completed in a timely
manner, and could result in substantial costs to AMD and Xilinx, including, but not limited to, costs
associated with the indemnification of their respective directors and officers. The existence of litigation
relating to the merger could also impact the likelihood of obtaining the required approvals from either AMD or
Xilinx stockholders. Moreover, the pending litigation and any future additional litigation could be time
consuming and expensive, could divert the attention of AMD and Xilinx management away from their regular
businesses and, if any one of these lawsuits is adversely resolved against either AMD or Xilinx, could have a
material adverse effect on AMD’s or Xilinx’s respective financial condition.
One of the conditions to the completion of the merger is that no injunction by any court or other governmental
entity of competent jurisdiction will be in effect that prevents, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of
the merger. As such, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the
consummation of the merger, that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from becoming effective or from
becoming effective.
Risks Relating to the Combined Company
Combining the businesses of AMD and Xilinx may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the
combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the
combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company’s common stock.
The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of AMD and Xilinx to combine their
businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings. AMD and
Xilinx have entered into the merger agreement because each believes that the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders and that combining the businesses of AMD and Xilinx will produce benefits and cost savings.
See “The Merger-​Recommendation of the AMD Board of Directors; AMD’s Reasons for the Merger” and “The
Merger-​Recommendation of the Xilinx Board of Directors; Xilinx’s Reasons for the Merger.”
However, AMD and Xilinx must successfully combine their respective businesses in a manner that permits
these benefits to be realized. In addition, the combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost
savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If the combined
company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not
be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.
An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could
have

TABLE OF CONTENTS
an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which
may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company.
In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated
benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower
than what AMD and Xilinx expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If AMD and Xilinx are not
able to adequately address integration challenges, they may be unable to successfully integrate their
operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.​
The failure to successfully integrate the businesses and operations of AMD and Xilinx in the expected time frame may
adversely affect the combined company’s future results.
AMD and Xilinx have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate independently.
There can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the
integration process could result in the loss of key AMD or Xilinx employees, the loss of customers, the
disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards,
controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and
an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the
following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of AMD and Xilinx in order
to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger so the combined company performs as expected:
combining the companies’ operations and corporate functions;
combining the businesses of AMD and Xilinx and meeting the capital requirements of the combined
company, in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve any cost savings or other
synergies anticipated to result from the merger, the failure of which would result in the anticipated
benefits of the merger not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;
integrating personnel from the two companies, especially in the COVID-19 environment which has
required employees to work remotely in most locations;
integrating the companies’ technologies and technologies licensed from third parties;
integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers;
identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;
harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development and compensation programs,
internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;
maintaining existing agreements with customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, avoiding delays
in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, and
leveraging relationships with such third parties for the benefit of the combined company;
addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management
philosophies;
consolidating the companies’ administrative and information technology infrastructure;
coordinating distribution and marketing efforts;
managing the movement of certain positions to different locations;
coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and
effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory or other governmental
approvals.
In addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company’s or both companies’ management and
resources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two
47 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may have been
beneficial to such company, which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the
combined company.
The combined company may not be able to retain customers, suppliers or distributors, or customers, suppliers or
distributors may seek to modify contractual relationships with the combined company, which could have an adverse
effect on the combined company’s business and operations. Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or
relationships with AMD or Xilinx.
As a result of the merger, the combined company may experience impacts on relationships with customers,
suppliers and distributors that may harm the combined company’s business and results of operations. Certain
customers, suppliers or distributors may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the
merger whether or not contractual rights are triggered as a result of the merger. There can be no guarantee that
customers, suppliers and distributors will remain with or continue to have a relationship with the combined
company or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the merger. If any customers, suppliers or
distributors seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations or discontinue the relationship with the
combined company, then the combined company’s business and results of operations may be harmed.
Furthermore, the combined company will not have long-term arrangements with many of its significant
suppliers. If the combined company’s suppliers were to seek to terminate or modify an arrangement with the
combined company, then the combined company may be unable to procure necessary supplies from other
suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.
AMD and Xilinx also have contracts with vendors, landlords, licensors and other business partners which
may require AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the
merger, or which may otherwise contain limitations applicable to such contracts following the merger. If these
consents cannot be obtained, the combined company may suffer a loss of potential future revenue, incur
costs and lose rights that may be material to the combined company’s business. In addition, third parties with
whom AMD or Xilinx currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their
relationship with either party in anticipation of the merger. Any such disruptions could limit the combined
company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The adverse effect of any such
disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger or by a termination of the
merger agreement.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined
company’s business and operations.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, suppliers,
distributors, consumers and other third parties due to the combination of AMD’s and Xilinx’s businesses
following the merger. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and
results of operations or may cause disruptions to the combined company’s operations.
The AMD and Xilinx unaudited prospective financial information is inherently subject to uncertainties, the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this document is preliminary and the combined
company’s actual financial position and results of operations after the merger may differ materially from these
estimates and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the effect
of any divestitures that may be required in connection with the merger.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and unaudited pro forma per share data
included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only, contain a
variety of adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and are not necessarily indicative of what the
combined company’s actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the merger been
completed on the dates indicated. The combined company’s actual results and financial position after the
merger may differ

TABLE OF CONTENTS
materially and adversely from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
does not reflect the effect of any divestitures that may be required in connection with the merger. See
“Comparative Historical Unaudited Pro Forma Per Share Data” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Statements.”
While presented with numeric specificity, the AMD and Xilinx unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information provided in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is based on numerous variables and
assumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and competition, general
business, the semiconductor and related industries, and economic, market and financial conditions and
additional matters specific to AMD’s or Xilinx’s business, as applicable) that are inherently subjective and
uncertain and are beyond the control of the respective management teams of AMD and Xilinx. As a result,
actual results may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
Important factors that may affect actual results and cause these unaudited projected financial forecasts to not
be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to AMD’s or Xilinx’s business, as
applicable (including each company’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable
periods), industry performance, general business and economic conditions. See “The Merger-AMD Unaudited
Financial Projections,” “The Merger-Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections” and “The Merger-Certain
Estimated Synergies.”
The combined company’s debt may limit its financial flexibility.
AMD and Xilinx continue to review the treatment of their existing indebtedness. AMD and Xilinx may seek to
repay, refinance, repurchase, redeem, exchange or otherwise terminate their existing indebtedness prior to, in
connection with or following the completion of the merger. If either AMD or Xilinx seeks to refinance its
existing indebtedness, there can be no guarantee that it will be able to execute the refinancing on favorable
terms or at all. Alternatively, AMD and Xilinx may seek to leave all or a portion of their existing indebtedness
outstanding as the primary obligation of the combined company or to incur additional indebtedness or
refinancing indebtedness prior to, in connection with or following the completion of the merger.
AMD’s or Xilinx’s substantial indebtedness could have adverse effects on such company’s and/or the
combined company’s financial condition and results of operations, including:
increasing its vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;
limiting its ability to compete and its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business
and the industry;
limiting its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders;
limiting its ability to borrow additional funds; and
increasing its interest expense and requiring it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from
operations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.
The companies’ ability to arrange any additional financing for the purposes described above or otherwise will
depend on, among other factors, the companies’ respective financial positions and performance, as well as
prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond their control. The level and quality of the combined
company’s earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, will impact the determination
of the combined company’s credit ratings. A decrease in the ratings assigned to the combined company by the
ratings agencies may negatively impact the combined company’s access to the debt capital markets and
increase the combined company’s cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the combined company
will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
combined
49 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
company will be able to maintain the current creditworthiness or prospective credit ratings of AMD or Xilinx,
and any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the
liquidity, capital position or access to capital markets of the combined company.
If the existing indebtedness of AMD and/or Xilinx remains outstanding, or if either company refinances its existing
indebtedness, covenants contained in the agreements governing such indebtedness will impose restrictions on the
combined company and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect their ability to operate their businesses.
The agreements that govern the indebtedness of AMD and Xilinx, in addition to any refinanced indebtedness,
may contain various affirmative and negative covenants. Such covenants may, subject to certain significant
exceptions, restrict the ability of the combined company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things,
incur liens, incur debt, engage in mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, transfer assets outside the
ordinary course of business, make loans or other investments, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests,
make other payments with respect to equity interests, repay or repurchase subordinated debt and engage in
affiliate transactions. In addition, the agreements governing the existing indebtedness of AMD and Xilinx
contain financial covenants that would require the combined company to maintain certain financial ratios
under certain circumstances. The ability of the combined company and its subsidiaries to comply with these
provisions may be affected by events beyond their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could
result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the combined company’s
repayment obligations.
Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, distributed to stockholders of the combined company will be
uncertain.
AMD has not historically paid cash dividends on its capital stock. Whether any dividends are declared or
paid to stockholders of the combined company, and the amounts of any such dividends that are declared or
paid, are uncertain and depend on a number of factors. If dividends are paid to stockholders of the combined
company, they may not be of the same amount as paid by Xilinx to its stockholders prior to the merger. The
AMD board of directors will have the discretion to determine the dividend policy of the combined company,
including the amount and timing of dividends, if any, that the combined company may declare from time to
time, which may be impacted by any of the following factors:
the combined company may not have enough cash to pay such dividends or to repurchase shares
due to its cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;
decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all
times entirely at the discretion of the AMD board of directors, which could change its dividend
practices at any time and for any reason;
the combined company’s desire to maintain or improve the credit ratings on its debt;
the amount of dividends that the combined company may distribute to its stockholders is subject to
restrictions under Delaware law and is limited by restricted payment and leverage covenants in the
combined company’s credit facilities and indentures and, potentially, the terms of any future
indebtedness that the combined company may incur; and
certain limitations on the amount of dividends subsidiaries of the combined company can distribute
to the combined company, as imposed by state law, regulators or agreements.
Stockholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not
been declared.
The combined company is subject to risks arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The outbreak of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, has
spread across the globe and disrupted the global economy. Governmental actions to reduce the spread of
50 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
COVID-19 have negatively impacted the macroeconomic environment in many ways, while the pandemic itself
has significantly increased economic uncertainty and abruptly reduced economic activity.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the combined company is highly uncertain and is
difficult to predict. The pandemic’s effects and their extent will depend on various factors, including, but not
limited to, the duration, scope and impact of the pandemic, restrictions on business and social distancing
guidelines that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities and how quickly and to what
extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Relevant adverse consequences of the
pandemic could include reduced liquidity, increased volatility of the combined company’s stock price,
operational disruption or failure due to spread of disease within the combined company or due to restrictions
on business and social distancing guidelines imposed or requested by governmental authorities,
unavailability of raw materials, disruption in the supply chain and increased cybersecurity and fraud risks due
to increased online and remote activity, as well as the adverse consequences of a macroeconomic slowdown,
recession or depression.
Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the combined company may continue to experience adverse
impacts to its business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including
reduced availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and the negative financial effects from any
recession or depression that may occur.
Any impairment of the combined company’s tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets,
including goodwill, may adversely impact the combined company’s financial position and results of operations.
The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC
805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. AMD will
record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their
respective fair values at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price over the net
fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the merger, the
combined company is expected to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated
balance sheet. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.”
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all
tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are
present. If, in the future, the combined company determines that tangible or intangible assets, including
goodwill, are impaired, the combined company would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment
testing of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as
it relates to the determination of fair value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash
flows of the combined company’s business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in
the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, which may have a material adverse impact on the
combined company’s financial position and results of operations.
The AMD bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the U.S.
federal district courts as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between AMD and its stockholders, which
will restrict the ability of stockholders of the combined company to choose the judicial forum for disputes with the
combined company or its directors, officers or employees.
The AMD bylaws provide that, unless AMD consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive
forum for the following types of actions or proceedings: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of AMD; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former
AMD director, officer, employee or stockholder to AMD or its stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim
arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the AMD charter or the AMD bylaws or as to which the DGCL
confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (iv) any action asserting a claim
governed by
51 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the internal affairs doctrine. Nothing in the AMD charter or the AMD bylaws would preclude stockholders
that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent the
Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law.
Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities
Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. The AMD
bylaws provide that the U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint
asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. However, there is uncertainty as to whether a
court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the
Securities Act.
These forum selection provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it
finds favorable for disputes with the combined company or its directors, officers or other employees, which
may discourage such lawsuits. While Delaware courts have determined that such forum selection provisions
are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act
against the combined company and its directors, officers or other employees in a venue other than in the U.S.
federal district courts. In such instance, the combined company would expect to vigorously assert the validity
and enforceability of these forum selection provisions. This may require further significant additional costs
associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the forum
selection provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions, any of which could seriously
harm the combined company’s business.
Other Risk Factors of AMD and Xilinx
AMD’s and Xilinx’s businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, AMD and
Xilinx are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks described in, as applicable, AMD’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and Xilinx’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended March 28, 2020, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company’s subsequently
filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, each of which are filed with the SEC
and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More

Matters to Be Considered at the AMD Special Meeting
The purpose of the AMD special meeting is to consider and vote on each of the following proposals, each of
which is further described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus:
AMD Proposal 1: Approval of the Share Issuance. To consider and vote on the AMD share issuance
proposal; and
AMD Proposal 2: Adjournment of the AMD Special Meeting. To consider and vote on the AMD
adjournment proposal.
Recommendation of the AMD Board of Directors
The AMD board of directors unanimously recommends that AMD stockholders vote:
AMD Proposal 1: “FOR” the AMD share issuance proposal; and
AMD Proposal 2: “FOR” the AMD adjournment proposal.
After careful consideration, the AMD board of directors unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of the
merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of AMD and its stockholders; (ii)
approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the merger and the share issuance, each on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement; and (iii) recommended that AMD stockholders approve of the AMD share issuance proposal. See
“The Merger-​Recommendation of the AMD Board of Directors; AMD’s Reasons for the Merger.”
Record Date for the AMD Special Meeting and Voting Rights
The record date to determine AMD stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the AMD
special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof is February 10, 2021. As of the close of
business on the AMD record date, there were 1,211,803,421 shares of AMD common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting.
55 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each AMD stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of AMD common stock such holder owned of
record at the close of business on the AMD record date with respect to each matter properly brought before
the AMD special meeting. Only AMD stockholders of record at the close of business on the AMD record date
are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the AMD special meeting and any and all adjournments or
postponements thereof.
Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
A quorum of AMD stockholders is necessary to conduct the AMD special meeting. The presence, virtually via
the AMD special meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of AMD common stock entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting will constitute a quorum. Shares of
AMD common stock represented at the AMD special meeting by virtual attendance via the AMD special
meeting website or by proxy and entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which an AMD
stockholder directs an “abstention” from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.
However, because all of the proposals for consideration at the AMD special meeting are considered “non-
routine” matters under Nasdaq rules (as described below), shares held in “street name” will not be counted as
present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the AMD stockholder provides their
bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals at the AMD special
meeting. If a quorum is not present, the AMD special meeting will be adjourned or postponed until the holders
of the number of shares of AMD common stock required to constitute a quorum attend.
Under Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” on behalf of the
beneficial owner of such shares have the authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain “routine”
proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners. However, banks,
brokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under
Nasdaq rules are “non-routine.” This can result in a “broker non-vote,” which occurs on an item when (i) a
bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more “routine” proposals to be
voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other “non-routine” proposals without
instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank,
broker or other nominee with voting instructions on a “non-routine” matter. All of the proposals before the
AMD special meeting are considered “non-routine” matters under Nasdaq rules, and banks, brokers or other
nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the AMD special meeting. As a
result, AMD does not expect any broker non-votes at the AMD special meeting and if you hold your shares of
AMD common stock in “street name,” your shares will not be represented and will not be voted on any matter
unless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance
with the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you
cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote
on any of the proposals before the AMD special meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the
beneficial owners.
Required Votes
Except for the AMD adjournment proposal, the vote required to approve each of the proposals listed below
assumes the presence of a quorum at the AMD special meeting. As described above, AMD does not expect
there to be any broker non-votes at the AMD special meeting.

that are virtually present via the AMD special
meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on
the AMD share issuance proposal.
Any shares not virtually present or
represented by proxy (including due to the

or other nominee to provide voting
instructions to such bank, broker or other
nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of

Approval requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the issued and

that are virtually present via the AMD special
meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on
the AMD adjournment proposal.
Any shares not virtually present or
represented by proxy (including due to the
failure of an AMD stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker
or other nominee to provide voting
instructions to such bank, broker or other
nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of
the AMD adjournment proposal.
An abstention or other failure of any shares
virtually present or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on
the AMD adjournment proposal will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the AMD
adjournment proposal. However, if an AMD
stockholder who holds shares in “street name”
through a bank, broker or other nominee
provides voting instructions for one or more
other proposals, but not for the AMD
adjournment proposal, voting power will
deemed to be withheld with respect to the
AMD adjournment proposal and such failure to
provide voting instructions will have no effect
on the AMD adjournment proposal.
Vote of AMD Directors and Executive Officers
As of February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
AMD directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote
approximately 1% of the total outstanding shares of AMD common stock. Although none of them has entered
into any agreement obligating them to do so, AMD currently expects that all AMD directors and executive
officers will vote their shares “FOR” the AMD share issuance proposal and “FOR” the AMD adjournment
proposal. See “Interests of AMD Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” as well as “Information
About AMD’s Board of Directors and Executive Officers,” “AMD Directors’ Compensation and Benefits” and
“AMD Executive Compensation.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Methods of Voting
Registered Stockholders
If you are an AMD stockholder of record, you may vote at the AMD special meeting by proxy over the
internet or telephone or by mail, or by virtually attending and voting at the AMD special meeting via the AMD
special meeting website, as described below.
By Internet: By following the instructions provided on your proxy card.
By Telephone: By following the instructions provided on your proxy card.
By Mail: If you have received a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail, you may complete and
return by mail the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope.
Virtually via the AMD Special Meeting Website: By visiting the AMD special meeting website, you can
virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting. AMD stockholders who plan to virtually attend
the AMD special meeting will need the 16-digit control number included on their proxy card in order
to access the AMD special meeting website.
Unless revoked, all duly executed proxies representing shares of AMD common stock entitled to vote at the
AMD special meeting will be voted at the AMD special meeting and, where a choice has been specified on the
proxy card, will be voted in accordance with such specification. If you submit an executed proxy without
providing instructions for any proposal, then the AMD officers identified on the proxy will vote your shares
consistent with the recommendation of the AMD board of directors on such proposal. If you are an AMD
stockholder of record, proxies submitted over the internet or by telephone as described above must be
received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 6, 2021. To reduce administrative costs and help the
environment by conserving natural resources, AMD asks that you submit a proxy to vote your shares through
the internet or by telephone.
By executing and delivering a proxy in connection with the AMD special meeting, you designate certain AMD
officers identified therein as your proxies at the AMD special meeting. If you deliver an executed proxy, but do
not specify a choice for any proposal properly brought before the AMD special meeting, such proxies will
vote your shares of AMD common stock on such uninstructed proposal in accordance with the
recommendation of the AMD board of directors. AMD does not expect that any matter other than the
proposals listed above will be brought before the AMD special meeting, and the AMD bylaws provide that the
only business that may be conducted at the AMD special meeting are those proposals brought before the
AMD special meeting by or at the direction of the AMD board of directors.
Beneficial (Street Name) Stockholders
If you hold your shares of AMD common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee in “street name”
instead of as a registered holder, you must follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee in order to vote your shares. Your voting instructions must be received by your bank, broker or
other nominee prior to the deadline set forth in the information from your bank, broker or other nominee on
how to submit voting instructions. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other
nominee for a proposal, your shares of AMD common stock will not be voted on that proposal because your
bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals to be
voted on at the AMD special meeting. See “-Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes.”
If you hold your shares of AMD common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee in “street name”
(instead of as a registered holder), you must obtain a specific control number from your bank, broker or other
nominee in order to virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting
website. See “-Virtually Attending the AMD Special Meeting.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Revocability of Proxies
Any AMD stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time before the proxy is voted at the
AMD special meeting. If you are an AMD stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by any one of
the following actions:
by sending a signed written notice of revocation to AMD’s Corporate Secretary, provided such
notice is received no later than the close of business on April 6, 2021;
by voting again over the internet or telephone as instructed on your proxy card before the closing of
the voting facilities at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 6, 2021;
by submitting a properly signed and dated proxy card with a later date that is received by AMD no
later than the close of business on April 6, 2021; or
by virtually attending the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website and requesting
that your proxy be revoked, or virtually voting via the AMD special meeting website as described
above.
Only your last submitted proxy will be considered.
Execution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect an AMD stockholder’s right to virtually attend
and vote at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website.
Written notices of revocation and other communications relating to the revocation of proxies should be
addressed to:
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 
Attn: Corporate Secretary 
corporate.secretary@amd.com 
2485 Augustine Drive 
Santa Clara, California 95054
If your shares of AMD common stock are held in “street name” and you previously provided voting
instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions. You may also change your vote
by obtaining your specific control number and instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee and
voting your shares at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website.
Proxy Solicitation Costs
AMD is soliciting proxies to provide an opportunity to all AMD stockholders to vote on agenda items,
whether or not such AMD stockholders are able to virtually attend the AMD special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. AMD will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from AMD
stockholders. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, AMD will request that banks, brokers and other
nominee record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of AMD common stock and
secure their voting instructions, if necessary. AMD may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and
other nominees on request for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.
AMD has also retained Mackenzie Partners to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with AMD
stockholders and estimates that it will pay them a fee of approximately $60,000, plus reimbursement for certain
out-of-pocket fees and expenses. AMD also has agreed to indemnify Mackenzie Partners against various
liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
Proxies may be solicited on behalf of AMD or by AMD directors, officers and other employees in person or by
mail, telephone, facsimile, messenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic
communication. AMD directors, officers and employees will not be paid any additional amounts for their
services or solicitation in this regard.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Virtually Attending the AMD Special Meeting
If you wish to virtually attend the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website, you must (i) be
a AMD stockholder of record at the close of business on February 10, 2021 (the AMD record date), (ii) hold
your shares of AMD common stock beneficially in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee as of the AMD
record date or (iii) hold a valid proxy for the AMD special meeting.
To enter the AMD special meeting website and virtually attend the AMD special meeting, you will need the
16-digit control number located on your proxy card. If you hold your shares of AMD common stock in street
name beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to virtually attend the AMD special
meeting via the AMD special meeting website, you will need to obtain your specific control number and
further instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee. The 16-digit control number is also needed to
access the list of AMD stockholders entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting during the time of the
meeting.
If you plan to virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website,
AMD still encourages you to vote in advance by the internet, telephone or (if you received a paper copy of
the proxy materials) by mail so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to virtually attend
the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website. Voting your proxy by the internet, telephone
or mail will not limit your right to virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special
meeting website if you later decide to do so.
Householding
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy
statements and notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a
single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” provides cost savings for companies. AMD has previously adopted
householding for AMD stockholders of record. As a result, AMD stockholders with the same address and last
name may receive only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Registered AMD stockholders
(those who hold shares of AMD common stock directly in their name with AMD’s transfer agent) may opt out
of householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending
a written request to AMD at the address below.
Some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple AMD
stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected
stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to
your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If,
at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to
request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.
AMD will promptly deliver a copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any AMD stockholder who only
received one copy of these materials due to householding upon request in writing to: Advanced Micro
Devices, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, corporate.secretary@amd.com, 2485 Augustine Drive, Santa Clara,
California 95054 or by calling (408) 749-4000.
Tabulation of Votes
The AMD board of directors will appoint an independent inspector of election for the AMD special meeting.
The inspector of election will, among other matters, determine the number of shares of AMD common stock
virtually present or represented by proxy at the AMD special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum,
determine the validity of all proxies and ballots and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to
AMD stockholders at the AMD special meeting.
60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Adjournments
If a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the AMD
special meeting to approve the AMD share issuance proposal, then AMD stockholders may be asked to vote
on the AMD adjournment proposal.
At any subsequent reconvening of the AMD special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may
be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting, and all proxies will be voted in the same
manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the AMD special meeting, except for any
proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened
meeting.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you as an AMD stockholder in connection with
the solicitation of proxies by the AMD board of directors for use at the AMD special meeting. At the AMD
special meeting, AMD is asking AMD stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the
issuance of shares of AMD common stock to Xilinx stockholders in connection with the merger. Based on the
number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding as of February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior
to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AMD expects to issue approximately 423.6 million shares
of AMD common stock to Xilinx stockholders in connection with the merger. The actual number of shares of
AMD common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be determined at the effective time based
on the exchange ratio of 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock and the
number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding at such time. Based on the number of shares of AMD
common stock and Xilinx common stock outstanding as of February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior
to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, upon completion of the merger, former Xilinx stockholders
are expected to own approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of AMD common stock and AMD
stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately 74.1% of the outstanding
shares of AMD common stock.
The AMD board of directors, after careful consideration, unanimously determined that the terms of the merger
agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of AMD and its stockholders, and approved and
declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and
the share issuance.
The AMD board of directors unanimously recommends that AMD stockholders vote “FOR” the AMD share issuance
proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD share issuance proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD
common stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal. Accordingly, any shares
not virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,
broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD share issuance proposal. An
abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the
AMD special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the AMD share issuance proposal. However, assuming a quorum is
present at the AMD special meeting, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a
bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not for the
AMD share issuance proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld with respect to the AMD share
issuance proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will have no effect on the AMD share
issuance proposal.

the solicitation of additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the AMD share issuance
proposal or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this joint proxy statement/prospectus is timely
provided to AMD stockholders.
AMD is asking AMD stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the AMD board of
directors to vote in favor of any adjournment of the AMD special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the AMD share issuance proposal or to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to this joint proxy statement/prospectus is timely provided to AMD
stockholders.
The AMD board of directors unanimously recommends that AMD stockholders vote “FOR” the AMD adjournment
proposal.
Whether or not a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD
common stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD adjournment proposal. Accordingly, any shares not
virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,

or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD
special meeting on the AMD adjournment proposal to vote on the AMD adjournment proposal will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the AMD adjournment proposal. However, if an AMD stockholder who
holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or
more other proposals, but not for the AMD adjournment proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld

64 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Record Date for the Xilinx Special Meeting and Voting Rights
The record date to determine Xilinx stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Xilinx
special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof is February 10, 2021. As of the close of
business on the Xilinx record date, there were 245,766,700 shares of Xilinx common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting (which includes 7,587 Xilinx RSUs which had
vested but were yet to be settled).
Each Xilinx stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Xilinx common stock such holder owned of
record at the close of business on the Xilinx record date with respect to each matter properly brought before
the Xilinx special meeting. Only Xilinx stockholders of record at the close of business on the Xilinx record date
are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Xilinx special meeting and any and all adjournments or
postponements thereof.
Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
A quorum of Xilinx stockholders is necessary to conduct the Xilinx special meeting. The presence, virtually
via the Xilinx special meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of Xilinx common stock entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting will constitute a quorum. Shares of
Xilinx common stock represented at the Xilinx special meeting by virtual attendance via the Xilinx special
meeting website or by proxy and entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which a Xilinx
stockholder directs an “abstention” from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.
However, because all of the proposals for consideration at the Xilinx special meeting are considered “non-
routine” matters under Nasdaq rules (as described below), shares held in “street name” will not be counted as
present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the Xilinx stockholder provides their
bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals at the Xilinx special
meeting. If a quorum is not present, the Xilinx special meeting will be adjourned or postponed until the holders
of the number of shares of Xilinx common stock required to constitute a quorum attend.
Under Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” on behalf of the
beneficial owner of such shares have the authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain “routine”
proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners. However, banks,
brokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under
Nasdaq rules are “non-routine.” This can result in a “broker non-vote,” which occurs on an item when (i) a
bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more “routine” proposals to be
voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other “non-routine” proposals without
instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank,
broker or other nominee with voting instructions on a “non-routine” matter. All of the proposals before the
Xilinx special meeting are considered “non-routine” matters under Nasdaq rules, and banks, brokers or other
nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the Xilinx special meeting. As a
result, Xilinx does not expect any broker non-votes at the Xilinx special meeting and if you hold your shares of
Xilinx common stock in “street name,” your shares will not be represented and will not be voted on any matter
unless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance
with the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you
cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote
on any of the proposals before the Xilinx special meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the
beneficial owners.

Required Votes
Except for the Xilinx adjournment proposal, the vote required to approve each of the proposals listed below

holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting

present or represented by proxy (including
due to the failure of a Xilinx stockholder who
holds shares in “street name” through a
bank, broker or other nominee to provide
voting instructions to such bank, broker or
other nominee) will have no effect on the
outcome of the Xilinx compensation
proposal.
An abstention or other failure of any shares
virtually present or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting
on the Xilinx compensation proposal to vote
on the Xilinx compensation proposal will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”

addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds
shares in “street name” through a bank,
broker or other nominee provides voting
instructions for one or more other proposals,
but not for the Xilinx compensation proposal,
it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Xilinx compensation

of the Xilinx adjournment proposal. An
abstention or other failure of any shares

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Vote of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers
As of February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
Xilinx directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote less
than 1% of the total outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock. Although no Xilinx director or executive
officer has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, Xilinx currently expects that all Xilinx
directors and executive officers will vote their shares “FOR” the Xilinx merger proposal, “FOR” the Xilinx
compensation proposal and “FOR” the Xilinx adjournment proposal. See “Interests of Xilinx Directors and
Executive Officers In The Merger” and the arrangements described in Xilinx’s Definitive Proxy Statement on
Schedule 14A for Xilinx’s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, filed with the SEC on June 19, 2020, which is
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Methods of Voting
Registered Stockholders
If you are a Xilinx stockholder of record, you may vote at the Xilinx special meeting by proxy through the
internet, by telephone or by mail, or by virtually attending and voting at the Xilinx special meeting via the
Xilinx special meeting website, as described below.
By Internet: By following the instructions provided on your proxy card.
By Telephone: By following the instructions provided on your proxy card.
By Mail: If you have received a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail, you may complete and
return by mail the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope.
Virtually via the Xilinx Special Meeting Website: By visiting the Xilinx special meeting website, you can
virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting. In order to virtually attend and vote at the
Xilinx special meeting, you must first register at the Xilinx special meeting website in order to obtain a
unique meeting invitation by electronic mail.
Unless revoked, all duly executed proxies representing shares of Xilinx common stock entitled to vote at the
Xilinx special meeting will be voted at the Xilinx special meeting and, where a choice has been specified on the
proxy card, will be voted in accordance with such specification. If you submit an executed proxy without
providing instructions for any proposal, then the Xilinx officers identified on the proxy will vote your shares
consistent with the recommendation of the Xilinx board of directors on such proposal. If you are a Xilinx
stockholder of record, proxies submitted over the internet or by telephone as described above must be
received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 6, 2021. To reduce administrative costs and help the
environment by conserving natural resources, Xilinx asks that you submit a proxy to vote your shares through
the internet or by telephone.
By executing and delivering a proxy in connection with the Xilinx special meeting, you designate certain Xilinx
officers identified therein as your proxies at the Xilinx special meeting. If you deliver an executed proxy, but do
not specify a choice for any proposal properly brought before the Xilinx special meeting, such proxies will
vote your shares of Xilinx common stock on such uninstructed proposal in accordance with the
recommendation of the Xilinx board of directors. Xilinx does not expect that any matter other than the
proposals listed above will be brought before the Xilinx special meeting, and the Xilinx bylaws provide that
the only business that may be conducted at the Xilinx special meeting are those proposals brought before the
Xilinx special meeting by or at the direction of the Xilinx board of directors.
Beneficial (Street Name) Stockholders
If you hold your shares of Xilinx common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee in “street name”
instead of as a registered holder, you must follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee in order to vote your shares. Your voting instructions must be received by your bank, broker or
other

TABLE OF CONTENTS
nominee prior to the deadline set forth in the information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to
submit voting instructions. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee
for a proposal, your shares of Xilinx common stock will not be voted on that proposal because your bank,
broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals to be voted on
at the Xilinx special meeting. See “-Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes.”
If you hold your shares of Xilinx common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee in “street name”
(instead of as a registered holder), you must obtain a specific control number from your bank, broker or other
nominee in order to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting
website. See “-Virtually Attending the Xilinx Special Meeting.”
Revocability of Proxies
Any Xilinx stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time before the proxy is voted at the
Xilinx special meeting. If you are a Xilinx stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by any of the
following actions:
by sending a signed written notice of revocation to Xilinx’s Corporate Secretary, provided such
notice is received no later than the close of business on April 6, 2021;
by voting again over the internet or telephone as instructed on your proxy card before the closing of
the voting facilities at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 6, 2021;
by submitting a properly signed and dated proxy card with a later date that is received by Xilinx no
later than the close of business on April 6, 2021; or
by virtually attending the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website and requesting
that your proxy be revoked, or by virtually attending and voting at the Xilinx special meeting via the
Xilinx special meeting website as described above.
Only your last submitted proxy will be considered.
Execution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect a Xilinx stockholder’s right to virtually attend and
vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website.
Written notices of revocation and other communications relating to the revocation of proxies should be
addressed to:
Xilinx, Inc. 
Attn: Corporate Secretary 
corporate.secretary@xilinx.com 
2100 Logic Drive 
San Jose, California 95124 
(408) 559-7778
If your shares of Xilinx common stock are held in “street name” and you previously provided voting
instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions. You may also change your vote
by obtaining your specific control number and instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee and
voting your shares at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website.
Proxy Solicitation Costs
Xilinx is soliciting proxies to provide an opportunity to all Xilinx stockholders to vote on agenda items,
whether or not such Xilinx stockholders are able to virtually attend the Xilinx special meeting or any
adjournment or
68 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
postponement thereof. Xilinx will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from Xilinx stockholders. In addition
to the solicitation of proxies by mail, Xilinx will request that banks, brokers and other nominee record holders
send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of Xilinx common stock and secure their voting
instructions, if necessary. Xilinx may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and other nominees on
request for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.
Xilinx has also retained Innisfree to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with Xilinx stockholders
and estimates that it will pay them a fee of approximately $40,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket
fees and expenses. Xilinx also has agreed to indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and expenses that
relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions). Proxies may be solicited on
behalf of Xilinx or Xilinx directors, officers and other employees in person or by mail, telephone, facsimile,
messenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic communication. Xilinx
directors, officers and employees will not be paid any additional amounts for their services or solicitation in
this regard.
Virtually Attending the Xilinx Special Meeting
If you wish to virtually attend the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website, you must (i) be
a Xilinx stockholder of record at the close of business on February 10, 2021 (the Xilinx record date), (ii) hold
your shares of Xilinx common stock beneficially in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee as of the Xilinx
record date or (iii) hold a valid proxy for the Xilinx special meeting.
To enter the Xilinx special meeting website and virtually attend the Xilinx special meeting, you must first
register at the Xilinx special meeting website to obtain a unique meeting invitation by email. If you hold your
shares of Xilinx common stock in street name beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee and you
wish to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website, you must
provide a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee during registration to obtain a virtual control
number. If you are unable to obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee, you will be able to
register to attend the Xilinx special meeting, but may not vote your shares at the Xilinx special meeting.
If you plan to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website,
Xilinx still encourages you to vote in advance by the internet, telephone or (if you received a paper copy of
the proxy materials) by mail so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to virtually attend
the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website. Voting your proxy by the internet, telephone
or mail will not limit your right to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special
meeting website if you later decide to do so.
Householding
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy
statements and notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a
single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” provides cost savings for companies. Xilinx has previously adopted
householding for Xilinx stockholders of record. As a result, Xilinx stockholders with the same address and last
name may receive only one copy of this joint proxy statement /prospectus. Registered Xilinx stockholders
(those who hold shares of Xilinx common stock directly in their name with Xilinx’s transfer agent) may opt out
of householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending
a written request to Xilinx at the address below.
Some brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple Xilinx
stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected
stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to
your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If,
at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement or notice, or
69 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future
deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.
Xilinx will promptly deliver a copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any Xilinx stockholder who
received only one copy of these materials due to householding upon request in writing to: Xilinx, Inc., Attn:
Investor Relations, ir@xilinx.com, 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124 or by calling (408) 626-4293.
Tabulation of Votes
The Xilinx board of directors will appoint an independent inspector of election for the Xilinx special meeting.
The inspector of election will, among other matters, determine the number of shares of Xilinx common stock
represented at the Xilinx special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum, determine the validity of all
proxies and ballots and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to Xilinx stockholders at the
Xilinx special meeting.
Adjournments
If a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the Xilinx
special meeting to approve the Xilinx merger proposal, then Xilinx stockholders may be asked to vote on the
Xilinx adjournment proposal.
At any subsequent reconvening of the Xilinx special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may
be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same
manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the Xilinx special meeting, except for any
proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened
meeting.

If you need assistance voting or completing your proxy card, or if you have questions regarding the Xilinx
special meeting, please contact Innisfree, Xilinx’s proxy solicitor for the Xilinx special meeting, at:

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you as a Xilinx stockholder in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by the Xilinx board of directors for use at the Xilinx special meeting. At the Xilinx
special meeting, Xilinx is asking Xilinx stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Xilinx, with Xilinx being the surviving
corporation in the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD. Upon completion of the merger,
Xilinx stockholders will be entitled to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx
common stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (together with cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of AMD common stock).
The Xilinx board of directors, after careful consideration, unanimously determined that the merger is fair to and
in the best interests of Xilinx and its stockholders, and approved and declared advisable the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.
The Xilinx board of directors accordingly unanimously recommends that Xilinx stockholders vote “FOR” the Xilinx
merger proposal.
The merger and a summary of the terms of the merger agreement are described in more detail under “The
Merger” and “The Merger Agreement,” and Xilinx stockholders are encouraged to read the full text of the
merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A hereto.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx merger proposal requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock
entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx merger proposal. Accordingly, an abstention or
other failure to vote on the Xilinx merger proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Xilinx
merger proposal.
It is a condition to the completion of the merger that Xilinx stockholders approve the Xilinx merger proposal.

THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE XILINX MERGER PROPOSAL

XILINX PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY NON-BINDING VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION FOR
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, Xilinx is required to submit to a
non-binding advisory stockholder vote certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to Xilinx
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed under “Interests of
Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Xilinx Named
Executive Officers-Golden Parachute Compensation.” The Xilinx compensation proposal gives Xilinx
stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of Xilinx named
executive officers.
Accordingly, Xilinx is asking Xilinx stockholders to vote “FOR” the adoption of the following resolution, on a
non-binding advisory basis:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Xilinx named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K
under the heading “Interests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Quantification of
Payments and Benefits to Xilinx Named Executive Officers-Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the
associated narrative discussion and the agreements, plans, arrangements or understandings pursuant to
which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the Xilinx compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger
agreement. Accordingly, if you are a Xilinx stockholder, you may vote to approve the Xilinx merger proposal
and vote not to approve the Xilinx compensation proposal, and vice versa. The vote on the Xilinx
compensation proposal is advisory and non-binding. As a result, if the merger is completed, the merger-related
compensation may be paid to Xilinx named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the
terms of the compensation agreements and arrangements even if Xilinx stockholders do not approve the Xilinx
compensation proposal.
The Xilinx board of directors unanimously recommends that Xilinx stockholders vote “FOR” the Xilinx compensation
proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx compensation proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx
common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy and

meeting, any shares not virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx

compensation proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx compensation proposal to vote on the Xilinx

The following is a description of material aspects of the merger. While AMD and Xilinx believe that the
following description covers the material terms of the merger, the description may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You are encouraged to read carefully this entire joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the text of the merger agreement attached as Annex A hereto, for a more
complete understanding of the merger. In addition, important business and financial information about each
of AMD and Xilinx is contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
General
AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have entered into the merger agreement, which provides for the merger of
Merger Sub with and into Xilinx. As a result of the merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and
Xilinx will continue its existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned
subsidiary of AMD. The surviving corporation will be named “Xilinx, Inc.”
Merger Consideration
At the effective time, each share of Xilinx common stock (other than shares held in treasury by Xilinx or held
directly by AMD or Merger Sub (which shares will be cancelled)) that was issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD
common stock as well as cash (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes) in lieu of any
fractional shares of AMD common stock.
The exchange ratio is fixed, which means that it will not change between now and the date of the merger,
regardless of whether the market price of AMD or Xilinx common stock changes. Therefore, the value of the
merger consideration will depend on the market price of AMD common stock at the effective time. The market
price of AMD common stock has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and
is expected to continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the dates of the
respective AMD and Xilinx special meetings, through the date the merger is completed and thereafter. The
market price of AMD common stock, when received by Xilinx stockholders in connection with the merger,
could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of AMD common stock on the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain
current market quotations for AMD and Xilinx common stock before deciding how to vote on any of the
proposals described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. AMD common stock is traded on Nasdaq under
the symbol “AMD” and Xilinx common stock is traded on Nasdaq under the symbol “XLNX.”
Background of the Merger
Each of AMD’s and Xilinx’s board of directors and senior management team regularly reviews their respective
company’s performance, future growth prospects and overall strategic direction and considers potential
opportunities to strengthen their respective businesses and enhance stockholder value. These reviews have
included consideration of whether the continued execution of each company’s strategy or possible strategic
opportunities, joint ventures or combination with third parties offered the best avenue to maximize stockholder
value.
From time to time over the past few years, AMD and Xilinx have had informal discussions regarding potential
strategic partnerships, collaborations and a potential combination between the two companies. In connection
with Xilinx’s approach to AMD about a potential business combination of the two companies, on August 13,
2018, AMD and Xilinx signed a mutual non-disclosure agreement. Xilinx is not a party or subject to any non-
disclosure or other agreement with a party other than AMD, including with Company A (as defined below),
with respect to a potential business combination that includes any standstill or “don’t-ask, don’t-waive”
provision that would inhibit such party from making a proposal. Shortly thereafter, the parties’ management
teams presented
74 TABLE OF CONTENTS
overviews of their respective businesses in order to assess support for the strategic logic of a combination,
but due to deal structuring and timing issues, these discussions were put on hold. While Dr. Lisa Su,
President and Chief Executive Officer of AMD and Victor Peng, President and Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx,
stayed in touch over time, no proposals (binding or non-binding) were exchanged between the parties until
2020. The Xilinx board of directors (the “Xilinx Board”) understood that Mr. Peng would be meeting with Dr.
Su, and potentially representatives of other potential counterparties, from time to time and directed that Mr.
Peng report to the Xilinx Board if these discussions solidified at a suitable time for Xilinx to consider engaging
in a business combination with AMD or another potential counterparty.
On August 19, 2019, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting to discuss a potential business combination between
Xilinx and AMD. On October 8, 2019, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met and continued their discussions of a potential
business combination between the parties. During these discussions, Dr. Su and Mr. Peng discussed a variety
of matters, including semiconductor market dynamics, the rationale for AMD acquiring Xilinx and the
importance of retaining key personnel in any proposed combination. Dr. Su communicated that Mr. Peng’s
leadership in the combined company would be important for the success of the combination to provide
continuity for the Xilinx business. Dr. Su noted that she envisioned that Mr. Peng would be a close partner
with her in the combined company, and they discussed, without any commitment or specific proposal on roles,
that Mr. Peng would be well-positioned from a leadership standpoint in the combined company should a
combination occur. Mr. Peng noted that this was not the right time for Xilinx to engage in discussions on a
combination with AMD but that because the strategic rationale for combining the companies was compelling,
it made sense to continue to stay in contact.
On November 19, 2019, the AMD board of directors (the “AMD Board”) held a meeting with members of senior
management and representatives of DBO Partners LLC (“DBO”), who had previously discussed strategic
alternatives with the AMD Board, in attendance. The AMD Board discussed with its advisors and senior
management potential strategic transactions that AMD may want to consider, including a potential transaction
between AMD and Xilinx.
On December 8, 2019, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of senior management and representatives
of DBO attending. Each of Dr. Su and DBO provided the AMD Board with an analysis of a potential strategic
transaction with Xilinx. The AMD Board discussed possible strategies for approaching Xilinx regarding a
potential strategic transaction and authorized Dr. Su to approach Mr. Peng with a non-binding proposal.
On December 9, 2019, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met, and Dr. Su conveyed to Mr. Peng that AMD was prepared to
make a non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx. Mr. Peng reiterated that this was not the right time for Xilinx to
engage in discussions on a combination with AMD but that he would discuss it with Dennis Segers, Chairman
of the Xilinx Board. Mr. Peng and Dr. Su agreed to meet again after the New Year.
On December 10, 2019, Mr. Peng and the Chief Executive Officer of another semiconductor company
(“Company A”) were both participants in a broader, pre-scheduled meeting, following which the Chief
Executive Officer of Company A asked to speak with Mr. Peng separately. At the meeting, the Chief Executive
Officer of Company A conveyed Company A’s interest in exploring a potential business combination with
Xilinx. Mr. Peng responded that the timing was difficult at this time and suggested speaking again after the
holidays.
On December 20, 2019, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of senior management attending. Dr. Su
provided an update to the AMD Board on her discussions with Mr. Peng regarding an acquisition of Xilinx by
AMD. She noted that they arranged to meet again on January 2, 2020 to discuss the rationale for a strategic
transaction in more detail.
On January 2, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met to further discuss a potential acquisition of Xilinx by AMD, and,
to that end, Dr. Su made a presentation to Mr. Peng summarizing at a high level AMD’s business, product
roadmaps and financial overview as well as potential synergies and benefits that could be achieved through a
combination with Xilinx, without proposing a price or other terms. Mr. Peng noted that the timing remained
challenging, particularly given the transaction consideration would likely be all-stock or stock-rich and recent
fluctuations in each party’s respective stock price, but he agreed to consider the concept in consultation with
the Xilinx Board.
75 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 16, 2020, Mr. Peng communicated to Dr. Su that the Xilinx Board had been updated on the
discussions between Mr. Peng and Dr. Su and that the Xilinx Board was continuing to consider whether to
engage in a potential transaction with AMD. Mr. Peng noted the Xilinx Board had several concerns, including
with respect to the fluctuations of both companies’ stock prices in a stock-rich transaction and that AMD
would need to make a compelling offer to address these risks and provide adequate downside protection to
Xilinx stockholders. Dr. Su stated that she was aiming to provide a non-binding indication of interest to Xilinx
in the second half of February.
On January 23, 2020, at the Chief Executive Officer of Company A’s request, Mr. Peng met with the Chief
Executive Officer of Company A, who made a presentation to Mr. Peng summarizing at a high level Company
A’s business and perspectives on a potential combination with Xilinx. Mr. Peng noted that the timing was
difficult from a business perspective to consider combining the two companies’ businesses. The Chief
Executive Officer of Company A agreed to follow up sometime in the future, with no specific timeframe for
reconnecting.
On February 11 and 12, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of senior management and
representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (“Credit Suisse”) attending. Dr. Su discussed
the timing of an offer and Mr. Peng’s potential role after the proposed transaction. Representatives of DBO
and Credit Suisse provided a review of Xilinx’s earnings, stock price performance, and preliminary analysis.
The AMD Board approved submission of a non-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.
On February 14, 2020, AMD formally retained DBO as a financial advisor to AMD as it related to the
contemplated transaction between AMD and Xilinx. After considering multiple banks of high quality and
reputation who were unlikely to have conflicts with respect to a transaction between AMD and Xilinx as
potential financial advisors to the AMD Board, and after discussing each bank’s experience, expertise and
qualifications, the AMD Board selected DBO on the basis of its qualifications, expertise and reputation, its
knowledge and understanding of AMD’s business, industry and affairs, and the absence of any conflicts with
respect to Xilinx.
On February 16, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a telephone call, during which Dr. Su conveyed that the AMD
Board had authorized a non-binding proposal, and that she would be seeking a response by March 2, 2020.
Later on February 16, 2020, Dr. Su delivered to Mr. Peng a non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx at a price of
$115.00 per share of Xilinx common stock, comprised of $15.00 per share in cash and $100.00 per share in
shares of AMD common stock.
On February 20, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and
representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), Xilinx’s outside legal advisor,
attending. At the meeting, Mr. Peng reported on AMD’s February 16 proposal. Also at this meeting,
representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), who had provided strategic financial
advice to Xilinx on other occasions, were invited to present to the Xilinx Board. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley reviewed certain financial aspects of Xilinx. The Xilinx Board discussed the current prospects of Xilinx
on a standalone basis, including potential upside opportunities to create value for Xilinx stockholders as well
as potential headwinds over the near to medium term. The Xilinx Board determined that, although they saw the
potential strategic logic behind a combination with AMD, the February 16 proposal was not at a sufficient
valuation level to warrant a counterproposal or price guidance to AMD at this time. The Xilinx Board
considered how best to respond by AMD’s requested deadline of March 2, 2020. In addition, Mr. Peng
provided an update to the Xilinx Board on Mr. Peng’s recent meetings with the Chief Executive Officer of
Company A. After discussions, the Xilinx Board determined that certain recent activity at Company A would
render a transaction of the size necessary for a combination with Xilinx challenging from a business execution
perspective and directed that Mr. Peng deliver this message to Company A. At this meeting, and at nearly
every subsequent meeting of the Xilinx Board leading up to the public announcement of the merger, the Xilinx
Board met in executive session with only independent directors and representatives of Skadden present.
Because no Xilinx director (other than potentially Mr. Peng, who did not participate in such executive
sessions) had a conflict of interest with respect to a transaction between AMD and Xilinx, no special
committee of independent directors of the Xilinx Board was established.
76 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 28, 2020, the Xilinx Board held another meeting, at which they further discussed a potential
transaction with AMD. A representative of Skadden discussed the directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of
considering a strategic transaction and various considerations that should be part of the Xilinx Board’s
decision-making process. Also at this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed its preliminary
views on certain financial aspects of AMD. After discussions, the Xilinx Board reiterated its previous
consensus view that while a combination with AMD could potentially result in significant upside opportunity
for Xilinx stockholders, the February 16 proposal was not sufficiently compelling to serve as a starting point
for negotiations or warrant a counterproposal or price guidance. The Xilinx Board also determined that it was
important for AMD to understand the uniqueness of Xilinx as an asset and the meaningful contribution to the
value of the combined company that Xilinx would bring, which in turn requires a greater valuation and
percentage ownership of the combined company. The Xilinx Board directed Mr. Peng to deliver this message
to AMD.
Later on February 28, 2020, Mr. Peng spoke to Dr. Su by telephone and conveyed the message as directed by
the Xilinx Board. Mr. Peng and Dr. Su agreed to meet on March 2, 2020 to discuss further, with Dr. Su noting
that AMD would not have a revised proposal at that time.
On March 2, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met as scheduled. Mr. Peng conveyed the considerations that were of
particular importance to the Xilinx Board as it related to a potential transaction, emphasizing the importance of
a significant premium to acknowledge the uniqueness of Xilinx as an asset and the meaningful contribution
that Xilinx would bring to the combined company and downside protection for Xilinx stockholders given
recent fluctuations in AMD’s share price. Dr. Su agreed to consider these points, and they agreed to speak
again on March 6, 2020.
On March 6, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by telephone. Dr. Su stated that AMD was not in a position to
provide a revised proposal and probed for guidance on price and other terms and to potentially engage in
preliminary due diligence in order to support any changes to AMD’s February 16 proposal. Mr. Peng
responded that Xilinx was also not in a different place from the prior indications and that the Xilinx Board
needed the proposal price to increase before engaging in further discussions.
On March 9, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of management and representatives of DBO,
Credit Suisse and Latham and Watkins LLP (“Latham”) attending. Dr. Su provided an update to the AMD
Board on recent discussions with Mr. Peng. Representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse reviewed alternatives
for an updated acquisition proposal and potential effects. The AMD Board approved submission of a second
non-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.
On March 10, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke again by telephone. Dr. Su noted that after a meeting of the
AMD Board the previous day, the AMD Board was still supportive of a potential transaction with Xilinx and
would target providing a revised proposal in one week’s time. Dr. Su acknowledged that this timing would
miss Xilinx’s next regularly scheduled board meeting, which was scheduled for March 11 and 12, 2020.
On March 11 and 12, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Among other topics, members
of Xilinx senior management gave an update to the Xilinx Board on COVID-19, which was a rapidly evolving
situation, as it related to Xilinx and its personnel as well as the broader marketplace. In addition, Mr. Peng
provided an update on his recent discussions with Dr. Su with respect to a potential business combination
and also reported to the Xilinx Board in detail his October 8, 2019 discussion with Dr. Su, including the
importance of Mr. Peng’s leadership role in the combined company to provide continuity for the Xilinx
business if the companies were to combine. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed certain preliminary
financial analyses. After discussions, the Xilinx Board directed Mr. Peng to communicate to AMD that any
revised proposal should provide for an all-stock deal and use an exchange ratio rather than a fixed price given
the volatility in the market. Also on March 12, 2020, Morgan Stanley delivered to the Xilinx Board a
relationship disclosure, which did not contain any issues of note.
Later on March 12, 2020, Mr. Peng met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to convey the message
as directed by the Xilinx Board at its March 11 and 12, 2020 meeting. Mr. Peng suggested that the parties
77 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reconnect in the fall if the market environment, in light of COVID-19 and other factors, and Company A’s
business, were more settled.
On March 13, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone to communicate the direction provided by the
Xilinx Board about a revised proposal. Dr. Su responded that the AMD Board and AMD’s outside advisors
agreed that using an exchange ratio was the appropriate way to proceed.
Also on March 13, 2020, AMD entered into an engagement letter with Credit Suisse as an additional financial
advisor to AMD as it related to the contemplated transaction between AMD and Xilinx. After discussing the
potential advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor as a complement to DBO, and
considering the magnitude of the potential transaction and the benefits of having an additional perspective
throughout the process, the AMD Board selected Credit Suisse based on its qualifications, experience and
reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking and financial advisory firm.
On March 16, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives
of DBO and Credit Suisse attending. Dr. Su summarized for the AMD Board her conversations with Mr. Peng
since the previous board meeting. Representatives from DBO and Credit Suisse reviewed proposed terms and
considerations for the acquisition proposal. The AMD Board approved submission of a revised non-binding
proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.
On March 17, 2020, Dr. Su contacted Mr. Peng by telephone to communicate a revised non-binding proposal
with a fixed exchange ratio of 2.2 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, which
resulted in an illustrative purchase price of approximately $92.14 per share of Xilinx common stock based on
AMD’s closing trading price on the date of the proposal. Dr. Su delivered the proposal to Mr. Peng in written
form after the call. Mr. Peng subsequently discussed the proposal with Mr. Segers and, consistent with the
discussions of the Xilinx Board during its March 11 and 12, 2020 meetings, discussed that, at this level, the
Xilinx Board had already determined that the proposal was at an insufficient valuation to engage in
substantive discussions and agreed that Mr. Peng should deliver that message to Dr. Su.
On March 19, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone to deliver the message that the revised proposal
was not sufficient from a price perspective and that, given the unprecedented market volatility, the parties
should stop discussions and check back in when the market environment, in light of COVID-19 and other
factors, was more settled. Mr. Peng suggested they might revisit a potential combination again in the fall.
There were no further substantive discussions between AMD and Xilinx until August 4, 2020.
On March 20, 2020 and March 21, 2020, Dr. Su communicated to the AMD Board the substance of her March
19 conversation with Mr. Peng.
On May 6, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management attending. The AMD
Board discussed the status of possible strategic transactions and collaborations, including a potential
acquisition of Xilinx by AMD. Dr. Su confirmed that Xilinx had rejected AMD’s March 17 proposal and that
there were no active discussions between AMD and Xilinx.
On July 13, 2020, the Chief Executive Officer of Company A requested a video call with Mr. Peng, at which the
Chief Executive Officer of Company A discussed certain updates on Company A’s business and also
conveyed that Company A would be delivering a non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx at a price of $120.00
per share of Xilinx common stock, comprised of $40.00 in cash and $80.00 in shares of Company A common
stock. The Chief Executive Officer noted that the leadership at Company A included a number of executives
from companies that Company A had previously acquired and suggested that a combination with Xilinx would
follow that track record, and perhaps to a greater extent considering the relative size of Xilinx’s business and
the potential combination with Xilinx compared to past acquisitions, without getting into specifics about the
potential combined company management. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A delivered the proposal
to
78 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Mr. Peng in writing after the call. Mr. Peng informed Mr. Segers of the proposal from Company A, and Mr.
Segers informed the Xilinx Board.
On August 3, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Skadden attending. Mr. Peng reported on Company A’s July 13 proposal.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed certain historical information with respect to Xilinx’s
financial performance, as well as preliminary financial analyses with respect to a potential transaction
involving Company A or AMD. The Xilinx Board also discussed perspectives regarding the strategic rationale
for pursuing a potential transaction with either Company A or AMD as well as Xilinx’s standalone strategic
plan, including certain execution risks related thereto, and other potential strategic counterparties for Xilinx.
After discussions, the Xilinx Board determined that not only did Company A’s July 13 proposal significantly
undervalue Xilinx, but also that a potential combination with Company A posed substantial risks from both a
regulatory approval and execution perspective, and therefore Company A’s proposal did not warrant a
counterproposal or further discussion at this time. The Xilinx Board directed Mr. Peng to deliver this message
to Company A.​
On August 4, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su were both participants in a broader, pre-scheduled video call,
following which Dr. Su asked to speak with Mr. Peng separately. Dr. Su communicated that given the current
macroeconomic climate and resilience of the semiconductor sector, she wanted to revisit extending a revised
non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx. Mr. Peng responded that although the timing was still not ideal from
Xilinx’s perspective, and noted that when they last spoke, they had talked about possibly revisiting
discussions regarding a potential business combination in the fall, he would inform the Xilinx Board of this
development. Dr. Su reported that the AMD Board was meeting later that week and that she would contact Mr.
Peng thereafter.
On August 6 and 7, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and
representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse attending. Representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse provided a
summary of the overall semiconductor landscape, potential strategic alternatives including the transaction
with Xilinx and noted that because of the current macroeconomic climate and resilience of the semiconductor
sector, it was an attractive time to consider restarting discussions to acquire Xilinx. The AMD Board approved
submission of a third non-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD, which was delivered
to Xilinx on August 9, 2020.
On August 8, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Company A by telephone to deliver the
message as directed by the Xilinx Board at its August 3, 2020 meeting. Mr. Peng noted that if Company A were
to submit a revised proposal that addressed the Xilinx Board’s concerns surrounding both valuation and the
regulatory approval and execution risks, he would bring that revised proposal to the Xilinx Board for
consideration. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A agreed to consider this feedback with the board of
directors of Company A and implied there would be a response to Xilinx thereafter but did not commit to a
specific timing or format for the response.
On August 9, 2020, Dr. Su contacted Mr. Peng by telephone and conveyed that, as authorized by the AMD
Board, she would be delivering a revised non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx in an acquisition in which
100% of the outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock would be exchanged for shares of AMD common
stock at a price of $132.50 per share of Xilinx common stock, with the final exchange ratio to be determined
prior to signing a definitive agreement. Dr. Su delivered the proposal to Mr. Peng in written form after the call.
On August 13, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Skadden attending, at which Mr. Peng and Mr. Segers updated the Xilinx Board on
AMD’s August 9 proposal. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed certain preliminary financial analyses
of AMD and Xilinx. The Xilinx Board discussed relative advantages and disadvantages of a combination with
AMD compared to Company A and other potential counterparties, as well as continuing on a standalone
basis. Following the discussion, the Xilinx Board authorized Xilinx management to engage in a discussion with
AMD regarding its August 9 proposal with a view toward improving that offer. The Xilinx Board also
authorized Xilinx
79 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
management to continue discussions with Morgan Stanley around potentially engaging them in connection
with Xilinx’s review of potential strategic transactions. In addition, Mr. Segers reported that he had received
outreach from the Chairperson of the board of directors of Company A, who wanted to speak with him. The
Xilinx Board determined that Mr. Segers should speak with the Chairperson of the Board of Company A within
the next week and, consistent with the message that Mr. Peng had already conveyed to the Chief Executive
Officer of Company A on August 8, 2020, reiterate the Xilinx Board’s view that Company A’s July 13 proposal
significantly undervalued Xilinx and was not sufficient to warrant a counterproposal or further discussion at
this time.
On August 17, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by video call. Mr. Peng communicated that, while the Xilinx
Board had seriously considered AMD’s August 9 proposal, the price would need to significantly improve in
order for the Xilinx Board to authorize engagement in an initial management meeting. In accordance with the
Xilinx Board’s instructions, Mr. Peng suggested that an improved offer of greater than $140.00 per share of
Xilinx common stock would likely enable further discussions.
On August 24, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives
of DBO and Credit Suisse attending. Dr. Su provided an update on recent discussions she had with Mr. Peng
and discussed the feedback provided by Mr. Peng on August 17. Representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse
reviewed with the AMD Board potential responses to the Xilinx feedback, next steps and a proposed timeline.
The AMD Board approved a fourth non-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.
On August 25, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke again by video call, during which Dr. Su communicated a
revised non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx in an acquisition in which 100% of the outstanding shares of
Xilinx common stock would be exchanged for shares of AMD common stock at a price of $137.00 per share of
Xilinx common stock, with the final exchange ratio to be determined prior to signing a definitive agreement. Dr.
Su delivered the proposal to Mr. Peng in written form after the call.
On August 28, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting to discuss AMD’s August 25 proposal, with members of
senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Skadden attending. Representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided preliminary financial analyses with respect to the August 25 proposal, and
representatives of Skadden reviewed the Xilinx Board’s fiduciary duties in these circumstances, including as it
related to Company A and potential other counterparties. The Xilinx Board determined that the appropriate
next step would be for AMD and Xilinx to each deliver a management presentation, and then Xilinx would
provide a counterproposal to AMD following the presentations. In view of the current status of the
discussions and that the parties would be moving forward, the Xilinx Board also discussed engaging BofA
Securities as a second financial advisor, given BofA Securities’ expertise in the semiconductor industry and
familiarity with AMD and Xilinx, which the Xilinx Board felt would be helpful as a complement to Morgan
Stanley, given the magnitude of the potential transaction, the importance of the investment decision, and also
because it would be helpful to have a second perspective while going through this process. The Xilinx Board
also weighed the potential advantages and disadvantages of having two financial advisors. After discussions,
the Xilinx Board directed Xilinx management to reach out to BofA Securities to discuss a potential engagement
and determine if there might be any potential conflicts of interest.
Later on August 28, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by video call to deliver the message that while the Xilinx
Board was open to proceeding with mutual management meetings, the Xilinx Board was not prepared to
support a transaction on the terms of AMD’s August 25 proposal. Mr. Peng noted that the Xilinx Board
remained focused on the right intersection of the appropriate risk-adjusted value for Xilinx stockholders based
on Xilinx’s potential intrinsic value, the percentage of the combined company that Xilinx stockholders would
ultimately own and the companies’ relative contributions. Mr. Peng suggested that, given the Xilinx Board had
a regular board meeting scheduled during the week of September 7, 2020, it would make sense for AMD’s
management meeting to take place in advance of the Xilinx Board meeting, and Xilinx’s management meeting
could take place right after the Xilinx Board meeting on September 11, 2020. Dr. Su agreed to proceed with
mutual management meetings and noted she would discuss the sequencing and logistics with John Caldwell,
Chairman of the AMD Board.
80 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 29, 2020, a representative of Xilinx management reached out to BofA Securities to discuss
potentially engaging BofA Securities as a second financial advisor to Xilinx in connection with Xilinx’s review
of potential strategic transactions.
On August 30, 2020, Dr. Su contacted Mr. Peng by telephone to communicate that AMD would be able to
provide a management presentation to Xilinx on September 7, 2020, which would enable Xilinx management to
provide an update to the Xilinx Board during their meeting. Dr. Su also offered to speak with the Xilinx Board
during their meeting, and Mr. Peng agreed it would be good for her to speak directly to the Xilinx Board about
AMD’s business and her point of view on the potential combination.
On August 31, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by telephone to discuss the logistics of the upcoming
meetings.
On September 5, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and a
representative of Latham attending. The AMD Board reviewed and discussed Xilinx’s response to AMD’s
proposal, the overall plans for due diligence and AMD’s preliminary long-range financial plan that would be
shared with Xilinx in the upcoming management presentation.
On September 7, 2020, representatives of AMD management provided a management presentation to
representatives of Xilinx management.
From September 8 through September 10, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with
members of senior management attending and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and
Skadden attending for certain portions. Among other topics discussed, members of senior management
reported to the Xilinx Board their findings from the management presentation that AMD had given to Xilinx,
focusing in particular on the areas of engineering, product and technology. Then, representatives of each of
Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities discussed with the Xilinx Board AMD’s management presentation from a
financial perspective. Representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities also discussed with the
Xilinx Board certain preliminary financial analyses of AMD and Xilinx. That afternoon, Dr. Su presented to the
independent directors of the Xilinx Board her strategic vision for AMD and the rationale supporting a
transaction with Xilinx, and Dr. Su expressed her view that Mr. Peng’s continued leadership in the combined
company would be critical in order to provide business continuity for the Xilinx business and realize the
anticipated benefits of a transaction. After Dr. Su’s presentation, the Xilinx Board discussed their perspectives
on a potential transaction with AMD and began formulating a view on the appropriate counterproposal.
On September 11, 2020, representatives of Xilinx management provided a management presentation to
representatives of AMD management.
Later on September 11, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and
representatives of Skadden attending. At the meeting, members of senior management provided the Xilinx
Board with an update on the Xilinx management presentation to AMD that had taken place earlier that day. In
addition, after reviewing the proposed terms of the engagements with Morgan Stanley as lead financial
advisor and BofA Securities as a second financial advisor for this matter, as well as their respective
relationship disclosures, the Xilinx Board unanimously approved the engagement of each of Morgan Stanley
and BofA Securities in accordance with their respective terms. After considering multiple banks of high
quality and reputation who were unlikely to have conflicts with respect to a transaction between Xilinx and
AMD as potential financial advisors to the Xilinx Board, and after discussing each bank’s experience,
expertise and qualifications, the Xilinx Board selected (i) Morgan Stanley due to its qualifications, experience
and reputation, its knowledge and involvement in recent transactions in the industry, its knowledge of Xilinx’s
business and affairs, and the absence of any material conflicts with respect to AMD and (ii) after discussing
the advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor, given the magnitude of the
potential transaction, the importance of the investment decision and also because it would be helpful to have
a second perspective while going through the process, BofA Securities due to its experience in transactions
similar to the contemplated transaction, its reputation in the investment community, its familiarity with Xilinx
and its business, and the absence of any material conflicts with

respect to AMD. The Xilinx Board also instructed Mr. Peng not to discuss his own potential compensation as
part of the combined company with representatives of AMD unless and until the Xilinx Board consents to
such discussion, and Mr. Peng confirmed there had been no such discussions to date and accepted the Xilinx
Board’s instruction. After discussions, including as to the information provided at the September 10, 2020
meeting, the Xilinx Board authorized Mr. Peng to propose to AMD an all-stock transaction valued at $145.00
per share of Xilinx common stock, with some form of downside protection against the fluctuations of AMD’s
stock but also an ability to participate in the upside, as well as proportionate representation on the post-
closing AMD Board.
On September 13, 2020, Mr. Peng spoke to Dr. Su by video call and conveyed Xilinx’s non-binding
counterproposal as authorized by the Xilinx Board. Mr. Peng noted that for the downside protection element,
the Xilinx Board was open-minded between a downside collar (i.e., setting a minimum value for the exchange
ratio) and a cash/stock election (i.e., Xilinx stockholders could decide closer to closing if they wanted to
receive cash, up to a specified, capped amount, or stock, based on AMD’s then-current stock price). Mr. Peng
also conveyed the Xilinx Board’s request for proportionate representation on the post-closing AMD Board.
On September 14, 2020, at the direction of AMD and Xilinx, as applicable, representatives of Morgan Stanley,
BofA Securities, DBO and Credit Suisse had a telephone call to discuss pricing mechanisms that could
theoretically be used in a potential transaction between the parties.
Also on September 14, 2020, the Chief Executive Officer of Company A contacted Mr. Peng by telephone and
conveyed that Company A had been working on revising its July 13 proposal into a true “merger of equals”
transaction, with the current Chief Executive Officer of either Company A or Xilinx serving as the Chief
Executive Officer of the combined company, with the other serving as Chairperson of the combined company,
and a combined company board being comprised 50% of Company A directors and 50% of Xilinx directors.
The Chief Executive Officer of Company A noted that Company A was prepared to deliver a written non-
binding proposal to Xilinx but would not do so if the timing was not suitable for Xilinx. Mr. Peng agreed to
consider this concept in consultation with the Xilinx Board and then provide a response. After the call, Mr.
Peng updated Mr. Segers on this conversation and determined that he and Mr. Segers would provide an
update to the Xilinx Board at the next meeting to determine the appropriate response to Company A.
On September 16, 2020, Xilinx formally engaged Morgan Stanley as its lead financial advisor and BofA
Securities as its second financial advisor and executed an engagement letter with each of Morgan Stanley and
BofA Securities.
On September 17, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and
representatives of DBO, Credit Suisse and Latham attending. Dr. Su provided an update to the AMD Board on
her discussions with Xilinx’s directors and executive team. Dr. Su reviewed Xilinx’s technology capabilities,
risk factors, growth prospects and long term financial targets. AMD management provided its preliminary due
diligence findings to the AMD Board and discussed potential synergies between AMD and Xilinx.
Representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse discussed the deal structure considerations relating to the latest
counterproposal from Xilinx. The AMD Board then discussed potential responses to Xilinx’s counterproposal
and approved a counterproposal of (i) an exchange ratio representing a purchase price of $139.00 per share
(without any collar mechanism) and (ii) the addition of two members of the Xilinx board of directors. The AMD
Board also approved the formation of a transaction committee (the “AMD Transaction Committee”),
consisting of Messrs. Caldwell and Joe Householder, for purposes of convenience and efficiency, with the
authority to oversee and administer the day-to-day process with respect to the potential acquisition of Xilinx
by AMD.
On September 19, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting, at which Dr. Su conveyed a revised proposal to
acquire Xilinx in a transaction in which 100% of the outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock would be
exchanged for shares of AMD common stock at a price of $139.00 per share of Xilinx common stock, with the
final exchange ratio to be determined prior to signing a definitive agreement, and to appoint two Xilinx
directors to the post-closing company board. Dr. Su expressed the AMD Board’s concerns regarding either
form of downside protection that the Xilinx Board had suggested, insofar as it could be construed as a lack of
confidence on the part of the Xilinx Board in the transaction.
82 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 20, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Skadden attending. Mr. Peng reported on AMD’s
September 19 proposal. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Xilinx Board with certain preliminary
financial analyses. After discussions, the Xilinx Board determined that, based on the feedback received from
the AMD Board, it seemed highly unlikely that the AMD Board would support any transaction that included
downside protection at the time of announcement and, in view of AMD’s perspective, the Xilinx Board should,
in the negotiations, focus instead on maximizing value for Xilinx stockholders rather than downside protection.
On that basis, the Xilinx Board determined that the appropriate counterproposal on price would be that if
AMD’s price per share, based on a 10-day unaffected VWAP ending on the last business day before signing a
definitive agreement (the “AMD announcement price”), were $70.00 or lower, the “Xilinx transaction price”
would be $140.00 per share; if the AMD announcement price were $80.00 or higher, the Xilinx transaction price
would be $145.00; and if the AMD announcement price were between $70.00 and 80.00, the Xilinx transaction
price would be linearly interpolated between $140.00 and $145.00, with the exchange ratio to be calculated by
dividing the Xilinx transaction price by the AMD announcement price. The Xilinx Board also directed Mr. Peng
to request three seats for Xilinx directors on the post-closing company board in order to be more proportionate
to Xilinx stockholders’ implied pro forma ownership. In the event that AMD continued to reject Xilinx’s
structured proposals on price, the Xilinx Board also gave Mr. Peng guidance on the price threshold at which
they would be prepared to accept a deal, subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence and negotiation of
a mutually acceptable definitive agreement. Also at the meeting, Mr. Peng reported to the Xilinx Board on his
recent conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A. Mr. Peng noted that a “merger of equals”
offer with Company A as the acquirer would result in an offer price of approximately $101.00, while Company
A’s prior proposal from July 13, 2020 included an offer price of $120.00. The Xilinx Board determined that from
an offer price perspective, as well as taking into account that it was unlikely, from a financial point of view, that
Company A could do anything to meaningfully improve its proposal, and given the latest proposal from AMD
was valued at $139.00, it would not be worthwhile to engage with Company A at this time, and authorized Mr.
Peng to respond to Company A accordingly. The Xilinx Board also considered the risks and benefits of
performing a further “market check” to assess whether a transaction that offered greater immediate value to
Xilinx stockholders was reasonably available as compared to the transaction proposed by AMD, in terms of
price, timing, likelihood of consummation, regulatory and other considerations, and the effect such “market
check” would have on AMD’s engagement and interest. The Xilinx Board also considered that any “market
check” could result in public leaks of a potential sale process, which could also have an adverse impact on
employees, customers and external partners. The Xilinx Board concluded that a “market check” was unlikely to
result in a better outcome for Xilinx stockholders.​
Also on September 20, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting and Mr. Peng delivered the counterproposal
as directed by the Xilinx Board.
On September 21, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to deliver the response
as directed by the Xilinx Board. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A responded with understanding and
noted that the parties could reconnect another time if it made sense to do so down the line.
Also on September 21, 2020, the AMD Transaction Committee met, with Dr. Su, members of senior management
and representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse attending. The AMD Transaction Committee approved a revised
proposal in response to Xilinx’s September 20  proposal.
On September 22, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting. During the meeting, Dr. Su communicated a revised
proposal, wherein if the AMD announcement price were $73.00 or lower, the “Xilinx transaction price” would
be $140.00 per share; if the AMD announcement price were $83.00 or higher, the Xilinx transaction price would
be $143.00; and if the AMD announcement price were between $73.00 and $83.00, the Xilinx transaction price
would be interpolated between $140.00 and $143.00 using $141.00 as the midpoint, with the exchange ratio to
be calculated by dividing the Xilinx transaction price by the AMD announcement price. Dr. Su also reiterated
that maintaining a relatively small post-closing AMD Board continued to be important, such that only two
Xilinx
83 
th
TABLE OF CONTENTS
directors would be offered positions on the AMD Board. Dr. Su stated that this was AMD’s “best and final”
proposal. Shortly after this meeting, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone and conveyed that, before taking
AMD’s revised proposal to the Xilinx Board, he wanted to adjust the midpoint Xilinx transaction price to be
$141.50, rather than $141.00, so there would be symmetry between the $140.00 and $143.00 guardrails, and
noted he anticipated that this element of fairness would be important to the Xilinx Board. Dr. Su responded
that, while she was not currently authorized by the AMD Board to agree to this adjustment, she confirmed her
understanding that Mr. Peng would be taking AMD’s proposal as adjusted in this manner to the Xilinx Board,
and, if approved by the AMD Board, that this proposal as adjusted would be AMD’s “best and final”
proposal (the “Final AMD Proposal”).
On September 22, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Skadden attending. Mr. Peng reported on the Final
AMD Proposal and the latest discussions with Dr. Su around both price and board representation. After
discussions, the Xilinx Board unanimously agreed to the economic terms of the Final AMD Proposal, subject
to satisfactory completion of due diligence and negotiation of a mutually acceptable definitive agreement, but
also requested that Mr. Peng convey to Dr. Su that, while they would not terminate discussions over the issue
of two versus three seats for Xilinx directors on the post-closing AMD Board, the Xilinx Board would
appreciate consideration of a third seat, both for proportionate representation from a pro forma ownership
perspective and also to ensure sufficient understanding of the Xilinx business on the post-closing AMD
Board.
Later on September 22, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone to convey the message as directed by
the Xilinx Board. Dr. Su responded that she would discuss with the AMD Board and respond the following
day.
On September 23, 2020, the AMD Transaction Committee met, with Dr. Su and members of senior management
present, and approved Xilinx’s September 22 counterproposal.
Later on September 23, 2020, Dr. Su delivered to Mr. Peng a document reflecting the agreed-upon price terms
as set forth in the Final AMD Proposal and a post-closing AMD Board representation of at least two Xilinx
directors with up to three Xilinx directors at AMD’s discretion. The parties agreed to proceed expeditiously to
negotiate a mutually acceptable definitive agreement and to complete their respective due diligence reviews,
subject to further review and approval by the parties’ respective boards.
Later on September 23, 2020, representatives of Skadden delivered to Latham a draft NDA amendment to
revive the standstill and non-solicit provisions of the parties’ existing NDA, which had previously expired, a
draft clean team agreement and a draft joint defense agreement. Skadden also provided a draft non-binding
term sheet outlining certain proposed terms for the potential transaction to representatives of Latham, which
included the following key terms: (i) a requirement for AMD to agree to any divestures or limitations on its
post-closing business in order to obtain the approval of the transaction by antitrust authorities; (ii) a fiduciary
termination fee payable by Xilinx to AMD equal to 3% of Xilinx’s equity value in the event of a termination of
the merger agreement following a change in recommendation by the Xilinx Board; (iii) a fiduciary termination
fee payable by AMD to Xilinx equal to 3% of AMD’s equity value in the event of a termination of the merger
agreement following a change in recommendation by the AMD Board; (iv) a termination fee payable by AMD
to Xilinx equal to 0.5% of AMD’s equity value in the event AMD’s stockholders did not approve the
transaction; and (v) a regulatory termination fee payable by AMD to Xilinx equal to $2.5 billion in the event
the merger agreement were terminated as a result of a failure to obtain necessary antitrust approvals.
On September 26, 2020, Mr. Segers spoke with Dr. Su about the post-closing AMD Board representation of
Xilinx directors and discussed how to move this conversation forward.
Also on September 26, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by video call to discuss certain business topics raised
by Dr. Su relating to the potential transaction, including better understanding each party’s business
internationally.
On September 27, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke again by video call to continue their discussion of certain
business topics raised by Dr. Su. In addition to certain communications and operations matters, Dr. Su raised
the
84 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
topic of Mr. Peng’s role and title if the acquisition of Xilinx were to be completed and, after a discussion,
determined that the title of President would be best, subject to confirmation by the AMD Board. Prior to the
execution of the merger agreement, there were no discussions regarding the specific terms of Mr. Peng’s
employment post-closing. Dr. Su also mentioned the topic of whether Mr. Peng would serve on the post-
closing AMD Board and potential issues relating thereto. Mr. Peng responded that he could not advocate from
a personal perspective, but that it was a desire of the Xilinx Board to ensure there would be a good
understanding of the Xilinx business on the post-closing AMD Board. Dr. Su and Mr. Peng determined that
the appropriate next step would be for Mr. Caldwell to speak with Mr. Peng and Mr. Segers. After the call, Mr.
Peng updated Mr. Segers on this conversation.
Also on September 27, 2020, AMD and Xilinx executed the NDA amendment, and the joint defense agreement
and clean team agreement were executed on September 29, 2020 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The

Xilinx senior management, representatives of Xilinx’s outside advisors, members of AMD senior management
and representatives of AMD’s outside advisors, as applicable, on various business, financial, tax, accounting

representation, and noted that he was scheduled to speak with Mr. Caldwell later that day to further discuss.
Representatives of Skadden discussed a number of anticipated potential issues in the merger agreement,
including with respect to deal certainty, and potential responses.
Also on October 2, 2020, representatives of Latham delivered an initial draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Skadden. The draft included the following key terms, many of which were responsive to the
previously provided non-binding term sheet: (i) a requirement that AMD use reasonable best efforts to obtain
antitrust approvals, but no specific obligation for AMD to agree to any divestures or limitations on its post-
closing business; (ii) a mutual “force the vote” in the event the board of directors of either AMD or Xilinx
were to change its recommendation to stockholders with respect to the transaction as a result of an
intervening event, but not as a result of a superior proposal; (iii) a fiduciary termination fee payable by Xilinx
to AMD equal to 3.25% of Xilinx’s equity value in the event of a termination of the merger agreement following
a change in recommendation by the Xilinx Board; (iv) a fiduciary termination fee payable by AMD to Xilinx
equal to 3.25% of Xilinx’s equity value in the event of a termination of the merger agreement following a
change in recommendation by the AMD Board; and (v) no termination fee payable by AMD to Xilinx in the
event of a failure to obtain the approval of AMD stockholders or necessary antitrust approvals.

between Mr. Peng and Dr. Su on September 27, 2020. Mr. Caldwell expressed to Mr. Peng the AMD Board’s
excitement about the potential transaction and that the AMD Board viewed Mr. Peng continuing with the
combined company to run the Xilinx business as essential. Mr. Caldwell also noted that, whether or not Mr.
Peng served on the post-closing AMD Board, which would raise governance issues, Mr. Peng would still have
significant involvement and exposure to the AMD Board. After the call, Mr. Peng updated Mr. Segers on this
conversation.​
On October 8, 2020, the Wall Street Journal published an article reporting on a potential combination of AMD
and Xilinx.

value in the event of a termination of the merger agreement following a change in recommendation by the
AMD Board; and (iv) a reinsertion of the termination fees payable by AMD to Xilinx in the event of a failure to
obtain the approval of AMD stockholders (equal to 0.5% of AMD’s equity value) or necessary antitrust
approvals (equal to $2.5 billion).
Also on October 9, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and

an update to the Xilinx Board on certain due diligence findings. Also at this meeting, after referencing their
respective financial analyses of the exchange ratio, which each had reviewed with the Xilinx Board at the
Xilinx Board meeting on October 24, 2020, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities each delivered to the Xilinx
Board an oral opinion, each of which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken as set forth in the respective written opinions, in the case of the opinion delivered by Morgan
Stanley, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Xilinx common stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares), and, in the case of the opinion
delivered by BofA Securities, the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to holders of Xilinx common stock, as more fully described below under “-Opinion of Xilinx’s
Financial Advisors-Opinion of Morgan Stanley” and “-Opinion of Xilinx’s Financial Advisors-Opinion of BofA
Securities,” respectively. After discussions, including as to the matters described below under “-
Recommendation of the Xilinx Board of Directors; Xilinx’s Reasons for the Merger,” the Xilinx Board
unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
are fair to and in the best interests of Xilinx and its stockholders; (ii) declared advisable, approved and
authorized in all respects the merger agreement, the performance of Xilinx of its obligations thereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the merger agreement; and (iii) recommended that Xilinx stockholders adopt the merger agreement.
Later on October 26, 2020, following the approval of the merger agreement and the merger by the AMD Board
and the Xilinx Board, AMD and Xilinx finalized and executed the merger agreement, and on the morning of
October 27, 2020, prior to the opening of trading, issued a joint press release announcing that they had
entered into the merger agreement.
Recommendation of the AMD Board of Directors; AMD’s Reasons for the Merger
At a special meeting held on October 26, 2020, the AMD board of directors unanimously: (i) determined that
the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of AMD and its
stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger and the share issuance, each on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the merger agreement; and (iii) recommended that AMD stockholders approve the AMD share
issuance proposal.
ACCORDINGLY, THE AMD BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT AMD
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE AMD SHARE ISSUANCE PROPOSAL AND “FOR” THE AMD
ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.
As described under “-Background of the Merger,” in evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger and the share issuance, the AMD board of directors held a number
of meetings and consulted with AMD senior management and its outside legal and financial advisors. In
reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and to recommend that AMD stockholders vote to
approve the AMD share issuance proposal, the AMD board of directors considered a number of factors,
including, but not limited to the following (which are not necessarily presented in order of their relative
importance to the AMD board of directors):
Benefits of the Acquisition. The AMD board of directors believe that the acquisition of Xilinx
enhances AMD’s leadership position in high performance computing and expands AMD’s data center
business. Combining AMD’s and Xilinx’s complementary technologies and markets is expected,
taking into account AMD’s industry experience, publicly available information about other industry
participants and management’s best view as to industry-related information that is not publicly
available, to create the industry’s strongest portfolio of high performance processors, spanning
CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
adaptive SOCs and complement and strengthen AMD’s data center portfolio. Further, Xilinx’s leading position
in embedded markets is expected to drive new opportunities for AMD’s CPUs and GPUs. In this regard, the
AMD board of directors noted:
that Xilinx’s strengths in FPGA, adaptive SOCs and software platforms are highly complementary
with AMD’s CPUs and GPUs;
AMD’s and Xilinx’s complementary focus on leading-edge process technology and packaging
technologies, and the combined technology strengths of AMD and Xilinx creating
complementary technology leadership in the industry in multi-generation architectures, data
center innovation and software enablement;
the manufacturing benefits of applying learnings from AMD’s early adoption and high-volume
production ramp of advanced process nodes across the spectrum of Xilinx’s products;
the markets of the combined company by combining Xilinx’s leadership position and established
relationships in communications infrastructure, industrial, automotive, aerospace, defense and
other key verticals with AMD’s existing strengths in PC, gaming and data centers, expanding
AMD’s total addressable market to $110 billion, based on internal management estimates derived
from publicly available information about both companies and the markets in which they operate,
as well as AMD’s industry experience;
that the combined company will have greater research and development resources, engineering
expertise and technology, which will allow AMD to better serve customers and accelerate
innovation;
that the combined company’s complementary product offerings and engineering and technical
strengths will be aligned with important secular growth trends, such as cloud computing,
artificial intelligence, big data analytics, smart networking and software-defined infrastructure;
that the combination of AMD’s CPU and GPU compute engines with Xilinx’s flexible accelerators,
SmartNIC products, software stacks and domain expertise would enable the combined company
to offer solutions to customers in the telecom, edge, industrial and networking markets that
unlock additional levels of performance on critical workloads;
that the cultures of AMD and Xilinx are strongly aligned, including shared values and
commitment to innovation, execution and customer collaboration, and that this culture, along
with AMD’s commitment to excellence, will accelerate high performance and adaptive computing
visions of the combined company and create a premier growth franchise;
the expectation that the combined company will have increased financial strength and flexibility,
with an estimated $11.6 billion in combined revenue in the twelve month period prior to signing;
that the merger would immediately diversify AMD’s revenue streams and be accretive to AMD’s
margins, cash flow and earnings per share, without taking into account expected synergies;
the expectation that the merger will create synergies of approximately $300 million within 18
months subsequent to closing, driven primarily by lower operating expenses and cost of goods
sold; and
the expectation that the combined company will be well-capitalized with a stronger balance sheet
and an investment grade profile.
Exchange Ratio and Merger Consideration. The AMD board of directors considered the relative
favorability of the exchange ratio relative to the exchange ratios historically implied by the relative
trading prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock over various periods and relative to the current
assessment of the valuation of each company and of the synergies and other benefits of the merger,
in addition to:
the fact that, upon completion of the merger, AMD stockholders and former Xilinx stockholders

will own approximately 74% and 26%, respectively, of the combined company (based on fully
diluted shares outstanding of the combined company);
the oral opinion of DBO, rendered to the AMD board of directors, subsequently confirmed in a
written opinion dated October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of October 26, 2020, and subject to
the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken and other matters considered by DBO in connection with the preparation of its
opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to AMD (which opinion is more fully described below under “-Opinions of AMD’s
Financial Advisors-​Opinion of DBO” and is attached as Annex B hereto); and
the oral opinion of Credit Suisse, rendered to the AMD board of directors, subsequently
confirmed in a written opinion dated October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of October 26, 2020,
and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken and other matters considered by Credit Suisse in connection with the
preparation of its opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to AMD (which opinion is more fully described below under “-Opinions
of AMD’s Financial Advisors-Opinion of Credit Suisse” and is attached as Annex C hereto).
Other Factors Considered by the AMD Board of Directors. In addition to considering the factors
described above, the AMD board of directors considered the following additional factors that
weighed in favor of the merger:
historical information concerning AMD’s and Xilinx’s respective businesses, financial condition,
results of operations, earnings, trading prices, technology positions, managements, competitive
positions and prospects on stand-alone and forecasted combined bases; and
the current and prospective business environment in which AMD and Xilinx operate, including
international, national and local economic conditions and the competitive and regulatory
environment, and the likely effect of these factors on AMD and the combined company.
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The AMD board of directors considered that the terms of the merger
agreement, taken as a whole, including the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants, and
the circumstances under which the merger agreement may be terminated, in its belief, are reasonable.
The AMD board of directors also reviewed and considered the conditions to the completion of the
merger, and concluded that while the completion of the merger is subject to various regulatory
approvals, such approvals were likely to be satisfied on a timely basis.
The AMD board of directors weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the merger, including:
the risk that, because the exchange ratio under the merger agreement would not be adjusted for
changes in the market price of AMD or Xilinx common stock, the then-current trading price of the
shares of AMD common stock to be issued to holders of shares of Xilinx common stock upon the
consummation of the merger could be significantly higher than the trading price prevailing at the time
the merger agreement was entered into;
the fact that each of the opinions of DBO and Credit Suisse as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement speaks only as of the date of such
opinion and did not and will not take into account events occurring or information that has become
available after such date, including any changes in the operations and prospects of AMD or Xilinx,
general economic, monetary, market and other conditions and other factors that may be beyond the
control of AMD and Xilinx and on which the fairness opinions were based, any of which may be
material;
the risk that Xilinx’s financial performance may not meet AMD’s expectations;
the risk that the merger may not be completed or may be delayed despite the parties’ efforts, including
91

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the possibility that conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the merger may not be satisfied,
and the potential resulting disruptions to AMD’s and Xilinx’s businesses;
the potential length of the regulatory approval process and the possibility that governmental
authorities might seek to require certain actions of AMD or Xilinx or impose certain terms, conditions
or limitations on AMD’s or Xilinx’s businesses in connection with granting approval of the merger or
might otherwise seek to prevent or delay the merger;
the potential challenges and difficulties in integrating the operations of AMD and Xilinx and the risk
that anticipated cost savings and operational efficiencies between the two companies, or other
anticipated cost benefits of the merger, might not be realized or might take longer to realize than
expected;
the difficulties and challenges inherent in completing the merger and integrating the businesses,
operations and workforce of Xilinx with those of AMD and the possibility of encountering difficulties
in achieving expected revenue growth and other non-cost synergies;
the possible diversion of management attention for an extended period of time during the pendency
of the merger and, following closing, the integration of the two companies;
the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger, including those incurred
regardless of whether the merger is consummated;
that AMD would be required to pay to Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion in the event the merger
agreement were to be terminated in certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required
regulatory approvals;
the risk that AMD stockholders may not approve the AMD share issuance proposal at the AMD
special meeting or that Xilinx stockholders may not approve the adoption of the merger agreement at
the Xilinx special meeting;
that AMD would be required to pay to Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion in the event the merger
agreement were to be terminated in connection with a superior proposal or a change in the
recommendation by the AMD board of directors to its stockholders with respect to approval of the
share issuance;
the ability of the Xilinx board of directors, subject to certain conditions, to change its
recommendation supporting the merger in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event
other than a superior proposal, if the Xilinx board of directors determines that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Xilinx board of directors’ fiduciary
duties to its stockholders under applicable laws;
the ability of the Xilinx board of directors, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the merger
agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal; and
risks of the type and nature described under entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The AMD board of directors considered all of these factors as a whole and, on balance, concluded that the
potential benefits of the merger outweighed the risks and uncertainties of the merger.
In addition, the AMD board of directors was aware of and considered that AMD directors and executive
officers would have the right to continued service for, employment by and the right to continued
indemnification by the combined company. See “Interests of AMD’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors that the AMD board of directors considered is not
intended to be exhaustive, but rather is meant to include the material factors that the AMD board of directors
considered. The AMD board of directors collectively reached the conclusion to approve the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in light of the various
factors
92

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
described above and other factors that the members of the AMD board of directors believed were appropriate.
In view of the complexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the AMD board of
directors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the AMD board of directors did not find
it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights or values to
any of the factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or
unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the AMD board of directors. In considering the factors discussed
above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The foregoing description of AMD’s consideration of the factors supporting the merger is forward-looking in
nature. This information should be read in light of the factors discussed under “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Recommendation of the Xilinx Board of Directors; Xilinx’s Reasons for the Merger
At a meeting held on October 26, 2020, the Xilinx board of directors unanimously: (i) determined that the terms
of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of
Xilinx and its stockholders; (ii) declared advisable, approved and authorized in all respects the merger
agreement, the performance of Xilinx of its obligations thereunder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement; and (iii)
recommended that Xilinx stockholders adopt the merger agreement.
ACCORDINGLY, THE XILINX BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT XILINX
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE XILINX MERGER PROPOSAL, “FOR” THE XILINX COMPENSATION
PROPOSAL AND “FOR” THE XILINX ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.
As described under “-Background of the Merger,” in evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger, the Xilinx board of directors held a number of meetings and
consulted with Xilinx senior management and its outside legal and financial advisors. In reaching its decision
to approve the merger agreement and to recommend that Xilinx stockholders vote to adopt the merger
agreement, the Xilinx board of directors considered a number of factors, including, but not limited to the
following (which are not necessarily presented in order of their relative importance to the Xilinx board of
directors):
the opportunity to combine two successful businesses with well-positioned and proven product and
technology portfolios and complementary product offerings, combining CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs,
Adaptive SoCs and deep software expertise, to enable leadership in computing platforms for cloud,
edge and end devices;
the importance of scale in the competitive market environments in which Xilinx and AMD operate, and
the potential for the merger to enhance the combined company’s ability to compete effectively in
those environments and across multiple end markets, including the ability to capitalize on new growth
opportunities and to compete for customers and key employee talent;
the markets of the combined company by combining Xilinx’s leadership position and established
relationships in communications infrastructure, industrial, automotive, aerospace, defense and other
key verticals with AMD’s existing strengths in PC, gaming and data centers, expanding the combined
company’s total addressable market to $110 billion, based on internal management estimates derived
from publicly available information about both companies and the markets in which they operate, as
well as AMD’s industry experience;
the cultural alignment between Xilinx and AMD, including shared cultures of innovation, excellence
and collaboration, and that this cultural alignment will accelerate high performance and adaptive
computing visions of the combined company and create a premier growth franchise;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Xilinx board of directors’ consideration, from time to time, with the assistance of Xilinx
management and Xilinx’s financial and legal advisors, of the various strategic alternatives available to
Xilinx, including remaining an independent company and continuing to execute on Xilinx’s strategic
plan, and the Xilinx board of directors’ belief that the merger presents a more favorable opportunity
for Xilinx stockholders than the potential value that may result from remaining a standalone company
or pursuing other strategic alternatives;
the Xilinx board of directors’ knowledge of, and discussions with Xilinx management regarding,
Xilinx’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings, strategy and future prospects, including
Xilinx’s opportunities to create stockholder value in the future on a standalone basis and potential
risks in the execution of Xilinx’s strategic plan;
discussions with Xilinx management and Xilinx’s financial and legal advisors regarding AMD’s
business, operations, strategy and future prospects, and the Xilinx board of directors’ view regarding
the combined company’s financial condition as well as the diversification and growth expected to
result from the merger;
the expectation that the combined company could achieve approximately $300 million of cost
synergies within 18 months subsequent to closing and that Xilinx stockholders will be able to
participate in the benefits of such synergies as stockholders of the combined company;
the Xilinx board of directors’ view that the combined company will be well-capitalized with a strong
balance sheet and ability to generate free cash flow and, thereby, return capital to stockholders;
the implied value of the consideration to be received by Xilinx stockholders in the merger (which was
$142.99 per share of Xilinx common stock, calculated based on the exchange ratio of 1.7234 and the
average daily volume weighted average price per share of AMD common stock on the Nasdaq for the 
ten consecutive trading day period up to and including October 8, 2020, the last trading day prior to
media reports regarding a potential transaction between AMD and Xilinx, which represented an
approximate premium of 34.9% based on the closing price per share of Xilinx common stock of $105.99
on October 8, 2020);​
the exchange ratio of 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock is
fixed, which affords Xilinx stockholders the opportunity to benefit from any appreciation in the value
of the AMD common stock after the announcement of the merger, that the exchange ratio was the
result of extensive negotiation between the parties and the Xilinx board of directors’ belief that the
final exchange ratio represented the highest and best value that Xilinx could obtain from AMD;​
Xilinx stockholders will own approximately 25.9% of the combined company on a pro forma basis
(based on the number of shares of Xilinx common stock and AMD common stock outstanding as of
February 10, 2021 and the exchange ratio) and have the opportunity to participate in the future
earnings and growth of the combined company;
the fact that, at the effective time, at least two Xilinx directors will be appointed to the AMD board of
directors and that AMD agreed to nominate such individuals for election to the AMD board of
directors at AMD’s first annual meeting of stockholders following the closing, which will allow for
oversight of and input into the strategy of the combined company;
the fact that, at the effective time, Mr. Peng will join the combined company as President responsible
for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives, which will provide a level of continuity for the
Xilinx business, its stockholders and other stakeholders and help realize the anticipated benefits of
the merger;
the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, rendered to the Xilinx board of directors, subsequently confirmed
in a written opinion dated October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of October 26, 2020, and based upon
and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth

the written opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares of Xilinx common stock (other than holders of the Excluded
Shares) (which opinion is more fully described under “-Opinions of Xilinx’s Financial Advisors-​
Opinion of Morgan Stanley” and is attached as Annex D hereto);
the oral opinion of BofA Securities, rendered to the Xilinx board of directors, subsequently confirmed
in a written opinion dated October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and
subject 
to various assumptions and limitations described in its written opinion, the exchange ratio provided
for in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Xilinx common stock (which
opinion is more fully described under “-Opinions of Xilinx’s Financial Advisors-Opinion of BofA
Securities” and is attached as Annex E hereto);
the expected treatment of the merger as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more fully described under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”;
the Xilinx board of directors’ view, based on discussions with Xilinx management, of the ability for
AMD to integrate and combine the respective AMD and Xilinx businesses;
the review by the Xilinx board of directors with its legal and financial advisors of the structure of the
proposed merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement, including the parties’
representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to their respective obligations to complete
the proposed merger and the termination provisions and related termination fees, as well as the Xilinx
board of directors’ conclusion that, although the proposed merger was subject to various regulatory
approvals and other conditions, such approvals were likely to be obtained and the proposed merger
completed on a timely basis. In connection with such review, the Xilinx board of directors also 
considered the following specific aspects of the merger agreement (which are not necessarily
presented in order of relative importance):
that Xilinx and AMD agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to complete the
merger and obtain the necessary approvals and clearances required under applicable antitrust
laws, including the obligation of AMD to agree to make divestitures, license, hold assets
separate and implement other changes or restrictions in its business if necessary to obtain
antitrust approval for the merger, so long as the divestitures, licenses or restrictions would not
limit AMD with respect to assets, licenses, businesses, operations or product lines that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on (i) Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (ii) AMD and its subsidiaries (taken as a
whole), but for purposes of (ii), deemed to be the same size as Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken
as a whole), and that AMD will be required to pay a termination fee of $1.0 billion if the merger
agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain such antitrust
approvals;
the nature of the closing conditions included in the merger agreement, including the reciprocal
exceptions to the events that would constitute a material adverse effect on either Xilinx or AMD
for purposes of the merger agreement, as well as the likelihood of satisfaction of all conditions to
completion of the transactions;
the fact that there are limited circumstances in which the AMD board of directors may terminate
the merger agreement or change its recommendation that AMD stockholders approve the AMD
share issuance proposal, and the requirement that AMD pay Xilinx a $1.5 billion termination fee if
the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if the merger
agreement is terminated by Xilinx as a result of a change in recommendation by the AMD board
of directors;
Xilinx’s right to engage in negotiations with, and provide information to, a third party that makes
an unsolicited bona fide written proposal relating to an alternative transaction, if the Xilinx board
of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
financial advisor, that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
transaction that is superior to the merger with AMD and that failure to engage in such
discussions or negotiations, or provide such information, would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Xilinx board of director’s fiduciary duties to Xilinx and its stockholders;
the right of the Xilinx board of directors to change its recommendation that Xilinx stockholders
vote to adopt the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal or certain intervening
events, subject to certain conditions, and the Xilinx board of directors’ view that the termination
fee of $1.0 billion payable to AMD under certain circumstances is customary and reasonable and
would not preclude or deter a willing and financially capable third party from making an
acquisition proposal for an alternative transaction;
the fact that there are no financing conditions or contingencies, and that AMD does not require
financing in order to complete the merger; and
the fact that Xilinx has the right to specifically enforce AMD’s obligations under the merger
agreement.
In the course of its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the Xilinx board of directors also
considered a variety of risks, uncertainties and other potentially negative factors, including the following
(which are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
the fact that the exchange ratio under the merger agreement is fixed, meaning that Xilinx stockholders
could be adversely affected and the implied value of the merger consideration will decline if there is a
decline in the trading price of the AMD common stock;
that there is no assurance that, even if approved by Xilinx stockholders, the merger will be completed
on the anticipated timeline or at all;
the risk that the combined company will not realize all of the anticipated strategic and other benefits
of the merger, including the possibility that AMD’s financial performance may not meet Xilinx’s
expectations and that the expected synergies may not be realized or will cost more to achieve than
anticipated;
the challenges inherent in completing the merger and integrating the business, operations and
workforce of Xilinx and AMD and the risk that the anticipated benefits of the merger might not be
realized or may take longer to realize than expected;
the amount of time it could take to complete the merger, including that completion of the merger
depends on factors outside of the control of Xilinx or AMD, and the risk that the pendency of the
merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the execution of the merger
agreement could have an adverse impact on Xilinx or AMD, including their respective customer,
supplier and other business relationships and potentially impact the trading price of their respective
common stock;
the possible diversion of management attention for an extended period of time during the pendency
of the merger;
the risk that, despite the retention efforts of Xilinx and AMD prior to the consummation of the merger,
the combined company may not retain key personnel or there may be employee attrition;
the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the ability of Xilinx to solicit or negotiate
alternative transactions and that such provisions and the potential requirement to pay AMD a
termination fee of $1.0 billion, as described under “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees,” may
deter a potential acquirer from proposing an alternative transaction for Xilinx that would provide
Xilinx stockholders with greater value than the merger;
AMD’s right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate with respect to certain
acquisition proposals from third parties made prior to the time AMD stockholders adopt the AMD
share issuance;

the potential for litigation relating to the proposed merger and the associated costs, burden and
inconvenience involved in defending any such proceedings;
the restrictions in the merger agreement on the conduct of Xilinx’s business during the period
between execution of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger, including that Xilinx
is required to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material
respects, subject to specific limitations, which could delay or prevent Xilinx from pursuing certain
business opportunities or strategic transactions that may arise and could have a negative impact on
Xilinx’s ability to maintain its existing business and employee relationships;
the risk that Xilinx stockholders may not approve the adoption of the merger agreement at the Xilinx
special meeting or that AMD stockholders may not approve the AMD share issuance proposal at the
AMD special meeting;
the possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to or challenge the merger or may impose
terms and conditions on their approvals that adversely affect the business or financial results of
Xilinx, AMD or the combined company, as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement-
Regulatory Approvals,” and the fact that AMD is not required to undertake divestitures or agree to
any restrictions that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on (i) Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (ii) AMD and its
subsidiaries (taken as a whole), but for purposes of clause (ii), deemed to be the same size as Xilinx
and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole);
the fact that the opinion of Morgan Stanley as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement speaks only as of the date of such opinion and did
not and will not take into account events occurring or information that has become available after
such date, including any changes in the operations and prospects of Xilinx or AMD, financial,
economic, market and other conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Xilinx and
AMD and on which such opinion was based, any of which may be material;
the fact that the opinion of BofA Securities as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger speaks only as of the date of such opinion and did not and

the fact that Xilinx stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger;
the transaction costs and retention costs to be incurred in connection with the proposed merger,
regardless of whether the proposed merger is completed; and
the risks of the type and nature described under “Risk Factors” and the matters described under
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
The Xilinx board of directors considered the factors described above as a whole, including through engaging
in discussions with Xilinx senior management and Xilinx’s outside legal and financial advisors. Based on this
review and consideration, the Xilinx board of directors unanimously concluded that these factors, on balance,
supported a determination that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Xilinx and its stockholders, and to make its recommendation
to Xilinx stockholders that they vote to adopt the merger agreement.
In considering the recommendation of the Xilinx board of directors that Xilinx stockholders vote to adopt the
merger agreement, Xilinx stockholders should be aware that Xilinx directors and executive officers may have
certain interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Xilinx stockholders
generally, including the treatment of equity awards held by such directors and executive officers in the merger,
as described under “Interests of Xilinx’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.” The Xilinx board of
97

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
directors was aware of and took these interests into account when approving the merger agreement and
determining that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of Xilinx and its stockholders.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors that the Xilinx board of directors considered is not,
and is not intended to be, exhaustive. The Xilinx board of directors collectively reached the conclusion to
approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger, in light of the various factors described above and other factors that the Xilinx board of directors
believed were appropriate. In view of the complexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative,
that the Xilinx board of directors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Xilinx board
of directors did not find it useful to, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or
specific weights or values to any of the factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to
make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was
favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Xilinx board of directors. In considering the
factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Xilinx board of directors in
approving the merger agreement is forward-looking in nature. This information should be read in light of the
factors discussed under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinions of AMD’s Financial Advisors
Opinion of DBO
AMD retained DBO to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with
the merger. After considering multiple banks of high quality and reputation who were unlikely to have conflicts
with respect to a transaction between Xilinx and AMD as potential financial advisors to the AMD Board, and
after discussing each bank’s experience, expertise and qualifications, the AMD board of directors selected
DBO to act as AMD’s financial advisor based on DBO’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, and its
knowledge and understanding of AMD’s business and affairs. At the meeting of the AMD board of directors
on October 26, 2020, DBO rendered to the AMD board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing, that as of October 26, 2020, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by DBO, as
set forth in its written opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to AMD.​
The full text of the written opinion of DBO to the AMD board of directors, dated as of October 26, 2020, which sets forth,
among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations
on the scope of the review undertaken by DBO in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B hereto and is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, which opinion DBO expressly consented may be included in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. You should carefully read and consider DBO’s written opinion in its entirety, as it contains
important information. DBO’s opinion was directed to the AMD board of directors, in its capacity as such, and addresses
only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement to AMD as of
the date of the opinion, and does not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the merger or related
transactions or any other matter. DBO’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute any opinion or
recommendation as to how AMD stockholders or any other person should vote or act with respect to the merger or any
other matter. The summary of the opinion of DBO set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion and performing its related financial analyses, DBO, among other
things:
reviewed certain business and financial information concerning Xilinx;
98

• 
•

• 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning AMD
and Xilinx, respectively;
reviewed certain financial projections concerning AMD and Xilinx prepared by AMD and Xilinx
management, respectively;
reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from
the merger, prepared by AMD;
discussed with senior executives of AMD their assessment of the past and current operations,
financial condition and prospects of AMD, including information relating to certain strategic,
financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger;
discussed with senior executives of Xilinx their assessment of the past and current operations,
financial condition and prospects of Xilinx, including information relating to certain strategic,
financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger;
reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on AMD’s earnings per share, cash flow and financial
ratios;
compared the financial performance of Xilinx with that of certain publicly-traded companies that DBO
deemed comparable with Xilinx;
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of AMD and Xilinx and
certain parties and their respective financial and legal advisors;
reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, dated October 25, 2020, and certain related documents; and
performed such other financial analyses and considered such other factors as DBO deemed
appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, with the AMD board of directors’ consent, DBO assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the data, material and other information that was
publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to DBO by AMD and Xilinx (including, without
limitation, the information described above), or that was otherwise reviewed by DBO. DBO relied on
assurances of the respective managements of AMD and Xilinx that they were not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. DBO noted that projecting the
future results of any company is inherently subject to uncertainty. With respect to the financial projections,
DBO was advised by AMD management, and DBO assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared in
good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
AMD and Xilinx of the future financial performance of AMD and Xilinx, respectively. DBO expressed no view
or opinion with respect to the respective financial projections of AMD or Xilinx or the assumptions on which
they were made. DBO relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of
AMD and Xilinx of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the merger; (ii) the
timing and risks associated with the integration of AMD and Xilinx; (iii) the ability to retain key employees of
AMD and Xilinx, respectively; and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, AMD’s and Xilinx’s existing
and future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models.​
In addition, DBO assumed that the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the last draft it
reviewed and that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger
agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including that the merger will
be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Code. DBO also assumed that in connection with the
receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the merger,
no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on
AMD, Xilinx or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the merger. DBO is not a legal, tax,
regulatory or actuarial advisor. DBO is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of AMD and Xilinx and its legal, tax, regulatory or
99 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
actuarial advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory or actuarial matters and assumed the correctness in all
respects material to its analysis of all legal, tax, regulatory or actuarial advice given to AMD and the AMD
board of directors, including, without limitation, advice as to the legal, accounting and tax consequences of
the terms of, and transactions contemplated by, the merger agreement to AMD, the AMD stockholders or any
other person.
DBO’s opinion was addressed to the AMD board of directors in its consideration of the merger, and its
opinion does not address the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as
compared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to AMD, nor does it address
the underlying business decision by AMD to engage in the merger or the terms of the merger agreement or the
documents referred to therein. DBO’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any AMD
stockholder or any other person should vote on or act with respect to the merger or any matter related thereto.
DBO’s opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to AMD, as of October 26, 2020, of
the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement. DBO did not express any view on, and DBO’s opinion
does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any
other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in
connection with the merger. DBO expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of
the compensation to any Xilinx officer, director or employee, or any class of such persons, in each case in
their capacity as such. Furthermore, DBO was not asked to address, and its opinion does not address, the
fairness to, or any other consideration to be paid to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of AMD or Xilinx. DBO did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities, nor did DBO receive any such valuation or appraisals, of AMD or Xilinx. DBO’s opinion was
necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to DBO, as of October 26, 2020. Events occurring after October 26, 2020 may affect DBO’s
opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and DBO expressly disclaimed any obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion or advise any person of any in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which
DBO becomes aware after such date.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by DBO in connection with its oral
opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter dated October 26, 2020 to the AMD board of directors.
The following summary is not a complete description of DBO’s opinion or the financial analyses performed
and factors considered by DBO in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described
represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on
or before October 23, 2020, the last practical date prior to the meeting of the AMD board of directors to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. The various analyses summarized
below were based on the closing price of $86.51 per share of AMD common stock and $105.99 per share of
Xilinx common stock as of October 8, 2020, the last date prior to rumors of the merger being publicly reported
in a notable publication, and are not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Some of these
summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
the financial analyses used by DBO, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the
tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and of
the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the process underlying DBO’s opinion.​
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, DBO, with the consent and
at the direction of the AMD board of directors, used and relied upon, among other things, certain financial
projections provided by AMD and Xilinx management and estimates with respect to the potential cost
synergies, including the costs necessary to achieve such cost synergies, expected by AMD management to
result from the merger. The AMD financial projections provided by AMD management for the period through
the 2025 fiscal​

year, including its long-range projections through the 2023 fiscal year and extrapolated by AMD management
for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, which projections were prepared on a basis excluding share-based
compensation expense, are referred to as the “AMD projections” and are described under “-AMD Unaudited
Financial Projections,” and the Xilinx management projections provided by Xilinx management as adjusted by
AMD management for the period through 2025, which projections were prepared on bases both including and
excluding share-based compensation expense, are referred to as the “AMD adjusted Xilinx projections” and
are described under “-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections.” The estimates of potential cost synergies
provided by AMD’s management are described under “-Certain Estimated Synergies.”
Stand-Alone Xilinx Financial Analysis
Selected Comparable Public Company Analysis
DBO reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for Xilinx to corresponding
financial information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies in the processors and networking,
analog and communications sectors that DBO deemed comparable, based on its experience and professional
judgment, to Xilinx, which selected publicly traded companies are referred to as the “selected comparable
companies” and which information is shown below:

Although none of the selected comparable companies is directly comparable to Xilinx, these companies were
selected by DBO, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies in the processors and
networking, analog and communications sectors with certain operational and financial characteristics, which,
for purposes of its analyses, DBO considered to be similar to those of Xilinx. None of the selected companies
identified as meeting DBO’s selection criteria were excluded from the analysis.
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings, S&P Capital IQ, Wall Street research and
closing stock prices, as of October 23, 2020, the last trading day prior to the date of DBO’s opinion, for the
selected comparable companies and as of October 8, 2020 for Xilinx, the last date prior to rumors of the merger
being publicly reported in a notable publication, DBO calculated, for each selected comparable company and
for Xilinx, the following multiples and ratios: (i) aggregate value (calculated as the market value of common
equity (using the fully diluted equity value), plus outstanding principal debt (excluding in-the-money
convertible debt), less cash and cash equivalents, plus additional adjustments as necessary) as a multiple of
2021 calendar year estimated EBITDA on a non-GAAP basis as-reported by the selected comparable company
(2021E AV/EBITDA); and (ii) the price to estimated adjusted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis as-
reported by the selected comparable company ratio for the 2021 calendar year (2021E P/E).

Calculated by averaging the daily metrics for the selected comparable companies and calculating the
medians of the averaged values over the described time period.
Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis DBO selected a 2021E AV/​
EBITDA multiple reference range of 22.5x to 27.5x and 2021E P/E multiple reference range of 25.0x to 35.0x. In
selecting these reference ranges, DBO made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional
judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects
of Xilinx and the comparable companies that could affect the public trading values in order to provide a
context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Applying these reference ranges to
Xilinx’s 2021 calendar year estimated adjusted EBITDA and Xilinx’s 2021 calendar year estimated adjusted
earnings per share, in each case, based on the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections, DBO calculated the following
implied ranges of values per share, rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of Xilinx common stock:​

While none of the companies that participated in the Selected Transactions-Large Semiconductor Acquisitions
is directly comparable to AMD or Xilinx, the companies that participated in the Selected Transactions-Large
Semiconductor Acquisitions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be
considered similar to certain of AMD’s or Xilinx’s results, market size and product profile.
Premiums
For each of the Selected Transactions-Large Semiconductor Acquisitions, DBO calculated the premium per
share paid by the acquiror based on information they obtained from SEC filings, Wall Street research and S&P
Capital IQ data by comparing the transaction value per share to the target company’s: (i) closing share price as
of one trading day prior to announcement or, where applicable, prior to rumor or leak; and (ii) average closing
share price for the 30-trading day period prior to announcement or, where applicable, prior to rumor or leak.

professional judgment and experience, DBO selected a range of premiums of 22% to 55%, based on the 25th
and 75th percentiles from the above one-trading day period analysis, and premiums of 27% to 51%, based on
the 25th and 75th percentiles from the above 30-trading day period analysis, and applied such premiums to (i)
the closing share price of Xilinx common stock on October 8, 2020, the last trading day before the public
reporting of the merger in a notable publication, and (ii) the average closing share price of Xilinx common
stock for the 30-trading day period prior to October 8, 2020, respectively, to calculate ranges, rounded to the
nearest whole dollar, of implied equity values per share of Xilinx common stock as follows:

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings, S&P Capital IQ and publicly available Wall
Street research, for each transaction DBO also calculated aggregate value to next-twelve-months EBITDA (AV/​
NTM EBITDA) multiples and price to next-twelve-months earnings per share (NTM P/E) multiples by
comparing the transaction value and transaction value per share to the target company’s next-twelve-months
EBITDA and next-twelve-months earnings per share, respectively, at the time of announcement. The low, 25th

The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were
diverse and there are inherent differences in the businesses, operations, financial conditions and prospects of
Xilinx and the companies included in the Selected Transactions-Large Semiconductor Acquisitions analysis.
Based upon its professional judgment and experience, DBO selected a range of AV/ EBITDA multiples of 22.5x
to 27.5x and applied such range to the projected 2021 adjusted EBITDA of Xilinx based on the AMD adjusted
Xilinx projections, on a basis unburdened by share-based compensation costs, and a range of P/E multiples of
30.0x to 37.5x and applied such range to the projected 2021 adjusted earnings per share of Xilinx based on the
AMD adjusted Xilinx projections, on a basis unburdened by share-based compensation costs. Based on its
analysis, DBO calculated a range of implied values per share of Xilinx common stock, rounded to the nearest
whole dollar, as follows:

Discounted Equity Value Analysis of Xilinx
DBO performed a discounted equity analysis of Xilinx. In performing this analysis, DBO calculated the
estimated value per share of Xilinx common stock as-of-the-end-of 2023 and as-of-the-end-of 2024,
respectively, by applying a NTM P/E multiple reference range of 25.0x to 32.5x to Xilinx’s estimated next-
twelve-months earnings per share as of the end of the respective periods, in each case as reflected in the
AMD adjusted Xilinx

projections, and taking into account an annual dividend of $1.52 per share of common stock based on a run-
rate quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share of common stock determined by DBO based on Xilinx’s current
quarterly dividend. DBO derived the multiples based on certain comparable public companies and historical
trading multiples determined by DBO based on its experience in the industry and judgment as a financial
advisor. The as-of-the-end-of 2023 and 2024 per share values were then discounted to present value using
discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%. This range of discount rates was determined based on DBO’s
analysis of Xilinx’s cost of equity, which was informed by the historical and projected systematic risk of Xilinx
and the comparable companies as compared to the market as a whole, the risk-free rate and market risk
premium based on academic and industry research, and company operating metrics. Based on its analysis,
DBO calculated a range of implied values per share of Xilinx common stock, rounded to the nearest whole
dollar, of $121 to $165 per share based on the end of 2023 analysis, and of $125 to $173 per share based on the
end of 2024 analysis.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of Xilinx
DBO performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Xilinx by calculating the estimated present value of the
unlevered free cash flows (see “-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections”) of Xilinx reflected in the AMD
adjusted Xilinx projections for Q4 2020 and the years from 2021 through 2024 and terminal value at the end of
that period based on an exit multiple range of 25.0x to 32.5x applied to Xilinx’s estimated next-twelve-months
earnings as of the end of that period based on the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections and adjusted for the net
impact of interest. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense.
DBO derived the exit multiples based on certain comparable public companies and historical trading multiples,
determined by DBO, based on its experience in the industry and judgment as a financial advisor. The
unlevered free cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value using discount rates
ranging from 7.5% to 9.5%. This range of discount rates was determined based on DBO’s analysis of Xilinx’s
weighted average cost of capital, which was informed by the historical and projected systematic risk of Xilinx
and the comparable companies as compared to the market as a whole, the risk-free rate and market risk
premium based on academic and industry research, and company operating metrics. Based on its analysis,
DBO calculated a range of implied values per share of Xilinx common stock, rounded to the nearest whole
dollar, of $128 to $173 per share.
Stand-Alone AMD Financial Analysis
Selected Comparable Public Company Analysis
DBO reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for AMD to corresponding
financial information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies in the processors and networking,
analog and communications sectors that DBO deemed comparable, based on its experience and professional
judgment, to AMD, which selected publicly traded companies are referred to as the “selected comparable
companies” and which information is shown below:

Although none of the selected comparable companies is directly comparable to AMD, these companies were
selected by DBO, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies in the processors and
networking, analog and communications sectors with certain operational and financial characteristics, which,
for purposes of its analyses, DBO considered to be similar to those of AMD. None of the selected companies
identified as meeting DBO’s selection criteria were excluded from the analysis.

Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis DBO selected a 2021E AV/​
EBITDA multiple reference range of 30.0x to 45.0x and a 2021E P/E multiple reference range of 45.0x to 60.0x. In
selecting these reference ranges, DBO made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional
judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects
of AMD and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading values in order to provide
a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Applying these reference ranges to
AMD’s 2021 fiscal year estimated adjusted EBITDA and AMD’s 2021 fiscal year estimated adjusted earnings
per share, in each case, based on the AMD projections, DBO calculated the following implied ranges of values
per share, rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of AMD common stock:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Equity Value Analysis of AMD
DBO performed a discounted equity analysis of AMD by calculating the estimated per share value of AMD
common stock. In performing this analysis, DBO calculated the estimated value per share of AMD common
stock as of the end of 2023 and as of the end of 2024, respectively, by applying a NTM P/E multiple reference
range of 30.0x to 37.5x to AMD’s estimated next-twelve-months earnings per share as of the end of 2023 and a
NTM P/E multiple range of 27.5x to 35.0x to AMD’s estimated next-twelve-months earnings per share as of the
end of 2024, in each case as reflected in the AMD projections. DBO derived the multiples based on certain
comparable public companies and historical trading multiples determined by DBO based on its experience in
the industry and judgment as a financial advisor. The per share values as-of-the-end-of 2023 and 2024 were
then discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 10.5%. This range of discount
rates was determined based on DBO’s analysis of AMD’s cost of equity, which was informed by the historical
and projected systematic risk of AMD and the comparable companies as compared to the market as a whole,
the risk-free rate and market risk premium based on academic and industry research, and company operating
metrics. Based on its analysis, DBO calculated a range of implied values per share of AMD common stock,
rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of $74 to $98 per share, based on the end of 2023 analysis and of $70 to
$97 per share based on the end of 2024 analysis.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of AMD
DBO performed a discounted cash flow analysis of AMD by calculating the estimated present value of the
unlevered free cash flows (see “-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections”) of AMD reflected in the AMD
projections for Q4 2020 and the years from 2021 through 2024 and terminal value at the end of that period
based on an exit multiple range of 27.5x to 35.0x applied to AMD’s estimated next-twelve-months earnings as
of the end of the period based on the AMD projections and adjusted for the net impact of interest, which for
2024 and 2025 were extrapolated by AMD management. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based
compensation was treated as a cash expense with regards to AMD’s projected unlevered free cash flows. DBO
derived the exit multiples based on comparable public companies and historical trading multiples, determined
by DBO based on its experience in the industry and judgment as a financial advisor. The unlevered free cash
flows and terminal value were then discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to
10.5%. This range of discount rates was determined based on DBO’s analysis of AMD’s weighted average
cost of capital, which was informed by the historical and projected systematic risk of AMD and the
comparable companies as compared to the market as a whole, the risk-free rate and market risk premium based
on academic and industry research, and company operating metrics. Based on its analysis, DBO calculated a
range of implied values per share of AMD common stock, rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of $79 to $106
per share.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of Synergies (Standalone)
DBO also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the estimated synergies expected by AMD
management to be realized in connection with the merger (see “-Certain Estimated Synergies”). In performing
this analysis, DBO calculated the estimated present value of the expected annual after tax synergies, net of the
costs to achieve such synergies, referred to as “net synergies,” estimated for the period from 2020 through
2025, and based on the assumption that the merger is consummated in the fourth quarter of AMD’s 2021 fiscal
year, all as provided to DBO by AMD management. The terminal value of the net synergies at the end of 2024
was estimated by using perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% and the 2025 estimates. The range
of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by DBO utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking
into account the AMD projections, the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections and market expectations regarding
longterm real growth of gross domestic product and inflation and trends in the industries and sectors in which
AMD and Xilinx operate. The net synergies and terminal values were then discounted to present value using
discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 10.5%, which range was selected based on DBO’s experience in the
industry and judgment as a financial advisor to reflect an estimate of the cost of capital of the combined
company following consummation of the merger and reflecting the minimum and maximum discount rates used
in the discounted cash flow analyses of Xilinx and AMD, to derive a range of illustrative present values of the
expected net
107 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
synergies. DBO then divided the range of illustrative present values it derived by the number of fully-diluted
outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock, as provided by the management of Xilinx, to calculate a range of
implied values per share of Xilinx common stock of the expected net synergies and rounded to the nearest
whole dollar, of $10 to $26 per share.
Exchange Ratio Analysis
Comparable Companies, Discounted Equity Value, Discounted Cash Flow and Selected Transactions-Large
Semiconductor Analyses
Based upon a comparison of the range of implied equity values per share for each of Xilinx and AMD
calculated pursuant to the selected comparable public companies analyses (including the historical trading
analyses), discounted equity value analyses and discounted cash flow analyses described above, DBO
calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios for the merger. DBO also calculated a range of implied exchange
ratios for the merger based on the discounted cash flow analyses described above, inclusive of expected
synergies resulting from the merger, by adding the implied value per share of Xilinx common stock of the net
synergies calculated as described above under “-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of Synergies (Standalone).”
DBO also calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios for the merger by comparing the range of low to high
implied equity values per share for Xilinx common stock calculated pursuant to the selected large
semiconductor transactions described above under “-Stand-Alone Xilinx Financial Analysis-Selected
Transactions Large Semiconductor Analysis” based both on 1-Day and 30-Days average premiums paid and
implied multiples (both AV/EBITDA and P/E) 
and the range of low to high implied equity values per share for the AMD common stock calculated pursuant
to discounted cash flow analysis of AMD, on a stand-alone basis and without synergies, described above
under “-Stand-Alone AMD Financial Analysis-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.”​
With respect to any given range of exchange ratios, the higher ratio assumes the highest implied value per
share of Xilinx common stock divided by the lowest implied value per share of AMD common stock, and the
lower ratio assumes the lowest implied value per share of Xilinx common stock divided by the highest implied
value per share of AMD common stock. DBO’s analysis indicated the following implied ranges of exchange
ratios, which it compared to the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement of 1.7234 shares of AMD
common stock per share of Xilinx common stock.

DBO calculated the low, 25th percentile, median, mean, 75th percentile and high exchange ratio premiums paid
in the seven Selected Transactions-Large Stock Acquisitions relative to the exchange ratio of the acquiror and
target (defined as the target’s closing stock price divided by acquiror’s closing stock price) for the average
closing stock prices 10 trading days, 30 trading days, 60 trading days, six months and 12 months prior to the
original announcement of the transaction or, where applicable, prior to rumor or leak.
DBO also reviewed the historical trading prices for AMD and Xilinx common stock for various time periods
prior to October 8, 2020, the last date prior to rumors of the merger being publicly reported in a notable
publication. DBO calculated historical average exchange ratios for these periods by first dividing the closing
price per share of Xilinx common stock on each trading day during the period by the closing price per share of
AMD common stock on the same trading day, and subsequently taking the average of these daily historical
exchange ratios over such periods, which we refer to as the historical Xilinx/AMD exchange ratio for such
period. DBO then calculated the premiums implied by the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement of
1.7234 shares of AMD common stock per share of Xilinx common stock compared to the historical Xilinx/AMD
exchange ratio for such periods.​

DBO then applied the 25th percentile premiums and 75th percentile premiums of the precedent Selected
Transactions-Large Stock Acquisitions for these periods to the historical Xilinx/AMD exchange ratio for the
corresponding period to derive a range of implied exchange ratios for the merger, and compared these implied
exchange ratios, which are set forth in the following table, to the exchange ratio set forth in the merger
agreement of 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock per share of Xilinx common stock.
DBO also observed that applying the low and high premiums derived from the precedent Selected

General
In connection with the review of the merger by the AMD board of directors, DBO performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, DBO considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. DBO believes that selecting any portion of its
analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, DBO may have given various analyses and factors more or
less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable
than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described
above should not be taken to be DBO’s view of the actual value of AMD or Xilinx. In performing its analyses,
DBO made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of AMD
or Xilinx. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on AMD’s and Xilinx’s business and
the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of AMD and Xilinx and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any
estimates contained in DBO’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
DBO conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial
point of view of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement to AMD and in connection with the
delivery of its opinion, dated October 26, 2020, to the AMD board of directors. These analyses do not purport
to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of AMD’s or Xilinx’s common stock might actually
trade.​
The exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was determined through arms-length negotiations
between AMD and Xilinx and was unanimously approved by the AMD board of directors. DBO provided
advice to the AMD board of directors during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any
specific exchange ratio or amount of consideration to AMD or the AMD board of directors, nor did DBO opine
that any specific exchange ratio or amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio or
amount of consideration for the merger. DBO’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as
compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such
alternatives could be achieved or are available.
DBO’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute any opinion or recommendation as to how AMD
stockholders or any other person should vote or act with respect to the merger or any other matter. DBO’s
opinion and its presentation to the AMD board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration
by the AMD board of directors in deciding to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
opinion of the AMD board of directors with respect to the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement or
of whether the AMD board of directors would have been willing to agree to different exchange ratio or amount
of consideration. DBO’s opinion was approved by DBO’s opinion committee in accordance with DBO’s
customary practice.​
AMD retained DBO based upon DBO’s qualifications, experience in similar transactions and familiarity with
AMD and AMD’s industry. DBO provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of persons
and entities from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. DBO, its affiliates, directors, members,
110 
•

• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
managers, officers and employees may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
structure and effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of AMD, Xilinx, or any other company
that may be involved in the merger. In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, DBO has provided
advisory services to AMD and its affiliates for which it received aggregate fees of approximately $400,000. In
the two years preceding the date of its opinion, DBO has not had a material relationship with Xilinx or any of
its affiliates and has not received any fees from Xilinx or any of its affiliates. DBO and its affiliates may in the
future provide investment banking services to Xilinx, AMD or entities that are affiliated with Xilinx or AMD
and may receive fees for the rendering of such services.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, DBO provided AMD financial advisory services and a financial
opinion, described in this section and attached as Annex B hereto, in connection with the merger, and AMD
has agreed to pay DBO a fee of approximately $27.0 million for its services, approximately $24.3 million of
which is payable contingent upon the closing of the merger, including a portion of which may be paid in the
form of AMD common stock. In addition to the fee described above, at AMD’s sole discretion, an additional
payment of up to $10.0 million may be made at closing. AMD has also agreed to reimburse DBO for its
reasonable expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in
connection with its engagement. In addition, AMD has agreed to indemnify DBO and its affiliates, its and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each other person, if any, controlling DBO or any of
its affiliates from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities related to, arising out of or in
connection with DBO’s engagement.
Opinion of Credit Suisse
On October 26, 2020, Credit Suisse rendered its oral opinion to the AMD board of directors (which was
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Credit Suisse’s written opinion dated as of the same date) to
the effect that, as of October 26, 2020, and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made,
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered by Credit Suisse in
connection with the preparation of its opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair,
from a financial point of view, to AMD.​
Credit Suisse’s opinion was directed to the AMD board of directors and only addressed the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to AMD of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement and did not address any other aspect or
implication of the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse’s opinion in this joint proxy statement/​prospectus is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, a copy of which is attached as Annex C hereto and sets
forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other
matters considered by Credit Suisse in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However, neither Credit Suisse’s
written opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is intended to be, and they do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to any security holder as
to how such security holder should vote or act with respect to any matter relating to the merger.
In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse:
reviewed an execution copy of the merger agreement;
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to AMD and Xilinx;
reviewed certain other information relating to AMD and Xilinx, including: (i) financial forecasts
relating to Xilinx for the 2021 through 2025 fiscal years, prepared by Xilinx management as
extrapolated through the 2032 fiscal year by Xilinx management; (ii) financial forecasts relating to
Xilinx for the calendar quarter ending December 2020 and the 2020 through 2025 calendar years
prepared by AMD management (the “AMD adjusted Xilinx projections”); and (iii) financial forecasts
relating to AMD for the fiscal quarter ending December 2020 and the 2020 through 2023 fiscal years

and other transactions which had been effected; and
considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial,
economic and market criteria which Credit Suisse deemed relevant.
In connection with its review, Credit Suisse did not independently verify any of the foregoing information and,
with the consent of the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse assumed and relied upon such information
being complete and accurate in all respects material to its analyses and opinion. With respect to the AMD
projections and the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections, Credit Suisse was advised by AMD management, and
Credit Suisse assumed with the consent of the AMD board of directors, that such forecasts had been
reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
AMD management as to the future financial performance of AMD and Xilinx, respectively. With respect to the
Synergies Estimates, Credit Suisse was advised by AMD management, and Credit Suisse assumed with the
consent of the AMD board of directors, that (i) they had been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of AMD management as to the potential cost
synergies, including the costs necessary to achieve such cost synergies, anticipated to result from the merger
and (ii) the Synergies Estimates will be realized in the amounts and at the times indicated thereby. At the
direction of the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse assumed that the AMD projections, the AMD adjusted
Xilinx projections and the Synergies Estimates are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate AMD, Xilinx and
the merger and, at the direction of the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse relied upon the AMD projections,
the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections and the Synergies Estimates for purposes of its analyses and opinion.
Credit Suisse expressed no view or opinion with respect to the AMD projections, the AMD adjusted Xilinx
projections or the Synergies Estimates, or the assumptions and methodologies upon which they are based.​
For purposes of its analyses and opinion, Credit Suisse was advised and Credit Suisse assumed that the
merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. With the consent of
the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse also assumed that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or
third party consents, approvals or agreements in connection with the merger, no modification, delay,
limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on AMD, Xilinx or the
contemplated benefits of the merger. In addition, for purposes of its analyses and opinion, with the consent of
the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse assumed that the merger and any related transactions will be
consummated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement thereof that
was material to Credit Suisse’s analyses or opinion. In addition, Credit Suisse was not requested to make, and
has not made, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
AMD or Xilinx, nor was Credit Suisse furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. With the consent of
the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse further assumed that the final form of the merger agreement, when
executed by the
112 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
parties thereto, would conform to the execution copy reviewed by Credit Suisse in all respects material to
Credit Suisse’s analyses and opinion.
Credit Suisse’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to AMD of the exchange
ratio set forth in the merger agreement and did not address any other aspect or implication of the merger or
any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise,
including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger and the fairness of the amount or nature of, or
any other aspect relating to, any compensation or consideration to be received or otherwise payable to any
officers, directors, employees, security holders or affiliates of any party to the merger, or class of such
persons, relative to the exchange ratio or otherwise. Furthermore, Credit Suisse did not express any advice or
opinion regarding matters that require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, intellectual property, tax,
environmental, executive compensation or other similar professional advice. Credit Suisse assumed that AMD
had or would obtain such advice or opinions from the appropriate professional sources. The issuance of
Credit Suisse’s opinion was approved by Credit Suisse’s authorized internal committee.
Credit Suisse’s opinion was necessarily based on information made available to Credit Suisse as of the date of
its opinion and upon financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated
on the date of its opinion. As the AMD board of directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets
had been experiencing unusual volatility and Credit Suisse expressed no opinion or view as to any potential
effects of such volatility on AMD, Xilinx or the merger. Credit Suisse did not undertake, and is under no
obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events
occurring or coming to Credit Suisse’s attention after the date of its opinion. Credit Suisse’s opinion did not
address the relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might have
been available to AMD, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the AMD board of directors or
AMD to proceed with or effect the merger. Credit Suisse did not express any opinion as to what the value of
shares of AMD common stock actually would be when issued pursuant to the merger or the price or range of
prices at which AMD or Xilinx common stock may be purchased, sold or otherwise transferred at any time.​
Credit Suisse’s opinion and analyses were for the information of the AMD board of directors (in its capacity
as such) in connection with its consideration of the merger and were among many factors considered by the
AMD board of directors in evaluating the merger. Credit Suisse’s opinion did not constitute advice or a
recommendation to the AMD board of directors with respect to the merger or advice or any recommendation
to any security holder as to how such holder should vote or act on any matter relating to the merger. Neither
Credit Suisse’s opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the exchange ratio or of the views of the AMD
board of directors with respect to the merger.
In preparing its opinion to the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse performed a variety of analyses,
including those described below. The summary of Credit Suisse’s financial analyses is not a complete
description of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse’s opinion. The preparation of such an opinion is a
complex process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to
the financial, comparative and other analytic methods employed and the adaptation and application of those
methods to the unique facts and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither Credit Suisse’s opinion
nor the analyses underlying its opinion are readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Credit Suisse arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a
whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any individual analysis, analytic
method or factor. Accordingly, Credit Suisse believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses, analytic methods and factors, without considering all analyses and factors
or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion.
In performing its analyses, Credit Suisse considered business, economic, industry and market conditions,
financial and otherwise, and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its
opinion. No company, business or transaction used in Credit Suisse’s analyses for comparative purposes is
identical to
113

TABLE OF CONTENTS
AMD, Xilinx or the merger. While the results of each analysis were taken into account in reaching its overall
conclusion with respect to fairness, Credit Suisse did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding
individual analyses. The implied valuation reference ranges indicated by Credit Suisse’s analyses are
illustrative and not necessarily indicative of actual values nor predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses
relating to the value of assets, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices
at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which may depend on a variety of factors, many of
which are beyond the control of AMD and Credit Suisse. Much of the information used in, and accordingly
the results of, Credit Suisse’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed in connection with the preparation of
Credit Suisse’s opinion rendered to the AMD board of directors on October 26, 2020. The analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the assumptions,
qualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit
Suisse’s analyses.
For purposes of its analyses, Credit Suisse reviewed a number of financial metrics including:
Enterprise Value-generally the value, as of a specified date, of the relevant company’s outstanding
equity securities (taking into account its options and other outstanding dilutive securities) plus the
value as of such date of its net debt (the value of its outstanding indebtedness, preferred stock and
capital lease obligations less the amount of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet) and non-
controlling interests, less the value as of such date of its equity method investments (as applicable);
Adjusted EBITDA-generally the amount, for a specified time period, of the relevant company’s
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude, as applicable, the
impact of stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating
items; and
Adjusted EPS-generally the amount, for a specified time period, of the relevant company’s earnings
per weighted average shares outstanding (taking into account its options and other outstanding
dilutive securities), adjusted to exclude, as applicable, the impact of stock-based compensation
expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items.
Financial Analyses Regarding Xilinx
Selected Companies Analysis Regarding Xilinx
Credit Suisse considered certain financial data for Xilinx and selected companies with publicly traded equity
securities Credit Suisse deemed relevant. The selected companies were selected because they were deemed to

analysis. Stock prices for the selected companies used in the selected companies analysis described below
were as of October 23, 2020. The estimates of Xilinx’s future financial performance for the year ending
December 2021 used in the selected companies analysis described below were based on the AMD adjusted
Xilinx projections. Estimates of the future financial performance of the selected companies listed below for the

Selected Transactions Analysis Regarding Xilinx
Credit Suisse also considered the financial terms of certain business combinations and other transactions
Credit Suisse deemed relevant since 2015. The selected transactions were selected because the target
companies were deemed to be similar to Xilinx in one or more respects (based on Credit Suisse’s experience
and professional judgment). Financial data for the selected transactions were based on public filings, publicly

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding Xilinx
Credit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to Xilinx by calculating the
estimated net present value of the projected after-tax, unlevered free cash flows of Xilinx, treating stock-based
compensation as a cash expense, based on the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections. Credit Suisse applied, based
on its experience and professional judgment, a range of terminal value multiples of 17.0x to 22.0x to the Xilinx
NTM Adjusted EBITDA estimate for the year ending December 2025 and discount rates ranging from 7.5% to
9.5% derived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated
an implied equity value per share reference range for Xilinx common stock of $121.52 to $163.26.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding Xilinx Including Synergies Estimates
Credit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to Xilinx, including the impact of
the Synergies Estimates, by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected after-tax, unlevered
free cash flows impact of the Synergies Estimates based on the Synergies Estimates anticipated by AMD’s
management to result from the merger. Credit Suisse applied, based on its experience and professional
judgment, a range of terminal value multiples of 17.0x to 22.0x to the NTM Adjusted EBITDA impact of the
Synergies Estimates for the year ending December 2025 and discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 9.5% derived
from a weighted average cost of capital calculation. Credit Suisse then summed the estimated net present
values of the Synergies Estimates impact and the corresponding enterprise values of Xilinx implied by the
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding Xilinx. The discounted cash flow analysis including Synergies
Estimates indicated an implied equity value per share reference range for Xilinx common stock of $137.36 to
$185.01.

an implied equity value per share reference range for AMD common stock of $70.23 to $100.57.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding AMD
Credit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to AMD by calculating the
estimated net present value of the projected after-tax, unlevered free cash flows of AMD, treating stock-based

Financial Analyses Regarding the Merger
Implied Exchange Ratio Analysis
Credit Suisse then reviewed the 1.7234x exchange ratio for the consideration provided in the merger and
compared it with the ranges of exchange ratios implied by its analyses. For each approach noted below, the
implied reference range of exchange ratios was determined by (a) using as the bottom end, the amount
calculated by dividing the lower bound of the per share reference range for Xilinx common stock by the upper
bound of the per share reference range for AMD common stock and (b) using as the top end, the amount
calculated by dividing the upper bound of the per share reference range for Xilinx common stock by the lower
bound of the per 
share reference range for AMD common stock. This analysis resulted in the following implied exchange ratio
reference ranges, as compared to the exchange ratio of 1.7234x set forth in the merger agreement:​

Supplemental Information
Credit Suisse also noted for the AMD board of directors certain additional information that was not
considered material to Credit Suisse’s financial analyses with respect to its opinion but was referenced for
informational purposes, including the following:
Historical Trading High and Low Stock Prices. Credit Suisse reviewed the closing stock prices for
each trading day during the twelve-month period ended October 8, 2020 for AMD and Xilinx common
stock and noted that the high and low closing prices during such period were $92.18 and $28.38 for
AMD common stock and $111.87 and $68.98 for Xilinx common stock. The ranges of high and low
closing stock prices implied an exchange ratio range of 0.7483x to 3.9419x. Credit Suisse noted that the
exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is 1.7234x;
Historical Trading Exchange Ratios. Credit Suisse reviewed the exchange ratios implied by the
closing stock prices for each trading day during the twelve-month period ended October 8, 2020 for

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Xilinx common stock and noted that the high, low, and mean during such period were 3.2703x, 1.1424x,
and 1.8319x, respectively. Credit Suisse also reviewed the exchange ratios implied by the closing
stock prices for each trading day during the 5-year period ended October 8, 2020 for AMD and Xilinx
common stock and noted that the high, low, and mean during such period were 26.2732x, 1.1424x, and
6.3706x, respectively. Credit Suisse noted that the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is
1.7234x; and
Equity Research Price Targets. Credit Suisse reviewed the publicly available price targets for AMD
and Xilinx common stock published by certain equity research analysts prior to October 8, 2020 and
since July 28, 2020. Credit Suisse noted that the selected research analysts’ share price targets
reviewed with the AMD board of directors (i) for AMD ranged from $62.00 to $120.00 per share (with a
mean of $82.92 and a median of $84.00) and (ii) for Xilinx ranged from $86.00 to $130.00 (with a mean of
$110.79 and a median of $110.00). The ranges of price targets implied an exchange ratio range of
0.7167x to 2.0968x. Credit Suisse noted that the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is
1.7234x.
Other Matters
After discussing the potential advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor as a
complement to DBO, and considering the magnitude of the potential transaction and the benefits of having an
additional perspective throughout the process, AMD retained Credit Suisse as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger based on Credit Suisse’s qualifications, experience and reputation as an
internationally recognized investment banking and financial advisory firm. Credit Suisse is entitled to receive a
transaction fee of $18.0 million, approximately $16.2 million of which is payable contingent upon the closing of
the merger. In addition to the fee described above, at AMD’s sole discretion, an additional payment of up to
$10.0 million may be made at the closing of the merger.
Credit Suisse and its affiliates have in the past provided and currently are providing investment banking and
other financial advice and services to AMD and its affiliates for which advice and services Credit Suisse and
its affiliates have received and would expect to receive compensation, including among other things, during
the past two years, having been and continuing to be a lender under AMD’s credit facility. Credit Suisse and
its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial advice and services to AMD,
Xilinx and their respective affiliates for which advice and services Credit Suisse and its affiliates would expect
to receive compensation. In the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Credit Suisse has been paid
approximately $1.5 million in fees for investment banking services from AMD and its subsidiaries in matters
unrelated to the merger. Credit Suisse is a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and
brokerage activities as well as providing investment banking and other financial advice and services. In the
ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse and its affiliates may acquire, hold or sell, for its and its affiliates’
own accounts and the accounts of customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial instruments
(including bank loans and other obligations) of AMD, Xilinx and their respective affiliates, and any other
company that may be involved in the merger, as well as provide investment banking and other financial advice
and services to such companies and their affiliates.
Opinion of Xilinx’s Financial Advisors
Opinion of Morgan Stanley
After considering multiple banks of high quality and reputation who were unlikely to have conflicts with
respect to a transaction between Xilinx and AMD as potential financial advisors to the Xilinx Board, and after
discussing each bank’s experience, expertise and qualifications, Xilinx retained Morgan Stanley to act as
financial advisor to the Xilinx board of directors in connection with the proposed merger. The Xilinx board of
directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications,
expertise and reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the industry, and its
knowledge of Xilinx’s business and affairs. At the meeting of the Xilinx board of directors on October 26, 2020,
Morgan Stanley rendered its

oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of such date, and based upon and subject to the
various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Xilinx
common stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares).
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of October 26, 2020, which sets forth, among
other things, the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D. You are encouraged to read the entire opinion carefully and
in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was rendered for the benefit of the Xilinx board of directors, in its
capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement to the holders of shares of Xilinx common stock (other than holders of the
Excluded Shares) as of the date of the opinion. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address any other aspect of
the merger or related transactions, including the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, the price at which shares of AMD common stock or
Xilinx common stock would trade at any time in the future, or the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of Xilinx, or any class of such persons, relative to the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Xilinx common stock pursuant to the merger. The
opinion was addressed to, and rendered for the benefit of, the Xilinx board of directors and was not intended
to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of shares of Xilinx common stock or
any holder of shares of AMD common stock as to how to vote with respect to the merger.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information
of Xilinx and AMD, respectively;
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Xilinx
and AMD, respectively;
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the managements of Xilinx and AMD, respectively,
including certain adjustments to the financial projections of AMD and certain extrapolations to those
of Xilinx and AMD in each case prepared at the direction of Xilinx;
reviewed and discussed with the management of Xilinx certain publicly available Wall Street research
containing financial projections relating to Xilinx and AMD that are generally reflective of consensus
estimates;
reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from
the merger, prepared by the managements of Xilinx and AMD, respectively;
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Xilinx,
including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from
the merger, with senior executives of Xilinx;
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of AMD,
including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from
the merger, with senior executives of AMD;
reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on AMD’s earnings per share, cash flow, consolidated
capitalization and certain financial ratios;
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Xilinx common stock and AMD common
stock;
compared the financial performance of Xilinx and AMD and the prices and trading activity of the
Xilinx common stock and the AMD common stock with that of certain other publicly-traded
companies comparable with Xilinx and AMD, respectively, and their securities;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Xilinx and AMD and
their financial and legal advisors;
reviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents; and
performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed
appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied, or otherwise made
available to Morgan Stanley by Xilinx and AMD, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect
to the financial projections, as well as certain adjustments to the financial projections of AMD and certain
extrapolations to those of Xilinx and AMD in each case prepared at the direction of Xilinx and information
relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley
assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the respective managements of Xilinx and AMD of the future financial performance of Xilinx
and AMD. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the
managements of Xilinx and AMD of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the
merger; (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of Xilinx and AMD; (iii) their ability to retain
key employees of Xilinx and AMD, respectively and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, Xilinx and
AMD’s existing and future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models. In
addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth
in the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among
other things, that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization, pursuant to the Code, and that the
definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan
Stanley. Morgan 
Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other
approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will
be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in
the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared
to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could
be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a
financial advisor only and at Xilinx’s direction relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment
of Xilinx and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters (existing,
contingent or otherwise). Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or
nature of the compensation to any of Xilinx’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,
relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Xilinx common stock in the
transaction. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
Xilinx or AMD, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, October 26, 2020. Events occurring after October 26, 2020
may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not
assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with
its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion dated October 26, 2020. The following summary is
not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors
considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described
represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at its opinion,
Morgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis described

TABLE OF CONTENTS
below. Considering any portion of such analyses and factors considered, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text
of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
Furthermore, mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful
method of using the data referred to below.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized
and relied upon certain financial projections provided by Xilinx’s and AMD’s managements, including certain
adjustments to the financial projections of AMD prepared at the direction of Xilinx, and referred to below. For
further information regarding the financial projections, see “-Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections” and “-
AMD Unaudited Financial Projections.”
Relative Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the
potential future equity value of a company as a function of the company’s estimated future earnings. The
resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value for
such company’s potential future equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a
range of implied present equity values per share on a stand-alone basis for each of Xilinx and AMD.
To calculate the discounted equity value for AMD, Morgan Stanley utilized estimated calendar years 2022 and
2023 earnings per share based on the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections (as defined below), as well as
estimated calendar year 2022 earnings per share based on the AMD Street Case (as defined below). To
calculate the estimated discounted equity value for Xilinx, Morgan Stanley utilized fiscal years 2023 and 2024
earnings per share based upon the Xilinx projections (as defined below), as well as estimated fiscal year 2023
earnings per share based on the Xilinx Street Case (as defined below). Based upon the application of its
professional judgment and experience after reviewing and comparing certain financial estimates for each of
Xilinx and AMD with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for the
selected comparable companies described in “-Relative Public Trading Multiples Analysis,” Morgan Stanley
applied a range of P/E (as defined below) multiples (based on the range of P/E multiples for the comparable
companies listed in the following section, of 30.0x to 50.0x, in the case of AMD, and 24.0x to 36.0x, in the case
of Xilinx) to these estimates and applied a discount rate of 9.3%, in the case of AMD, and 6.8%, in the case of
Xilinx, which rates were selected based on each company’s estimated cost of equity, taking into account
estimated market risk premium risk free rate, betas and other factors.
Morgan Stanley calculated the high end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the highest per share price for
Xilinx resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above by the lowest per share price for
AMD resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above. Morgan Stanley calculated the
low end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the lowest per share price for Xilinx resulting from the
application of the relevant multiples described above by the highest per share price for AMD resulting from
the application of the relevant multiples described above. Based on the foregoing, Morgan Stanley calculated
the following implied exchange ratio reference range:

Relative Public Trading Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value
of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and
compared certain financial estimates for each of Xilinx and AMD with comparable publicly available
consensus equity analyst research estimates for selected companies that share similar business
characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, product
characteristics, revenue growth, growth margin, profitability and/or other similar operating characteristics
(which are referred to as the “comparable companies”). These companies were the following:
Analog Devices, Inc.;
Broadcom Inc.;
Inphi Corporation;
Intel Corporation;
Lattice Semiconductor Corporation;
Marvell Technology Group Ltd.;
Microchip Technology Inc.;
NVIDIA Corporation;
Qualcomm, Inc.; and
Texas Instruments Incorporated.
In the case of applying the analysis to Xilinx, AMD was included in the group of comparable companies. In
the case of applying the analysis to AMD, Xilinx was included in the group of comparable companies. None of
the selected companies identified as meeting Morgan Stanley’s selection criteria were excluded from the
analysis.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed (a) the ratio of price to earnings (“P/E”), which
Morgan Stanley defined as the ratio of price per share to estimated earnings per share, commonly referred to
as “EPS,” and (b) the ratio of P/E to growth (“P/E/G”), which Morgan Stanley calculated as the P/E divided by
the applicable revenue compounded annual growth rate (in each case the estimated revenue compound annual
growth rate from calendar year 2020 to calendar year 2022), of each of these comparable companies based on
publicly available financial information compiled by Thomson Reuters for comparison purposes. For the
purposes of this analysis and certain other analyses described below, Morgan Stanley utilized (a) the mean of
selected Wall Street research estimates for each of AMD and Xilinx available as of October 8, 2020 in the case
of AMD and as of October 21, 2020 or October 22, 2022 (as applicable) in the case of Xilinx, which is referred
to below as the “AMD Street Case” and the “Xilinx Street Case,” as applicable, (b) financial projections for
Xilinx, prepared by Xilinx and reflecting Xilinx’s LRP (as defined below), which are referred to below as the
“Xilnx projections,” and (c) financial projections for AMD, prepared by AMD, incorporating certain
adjustments thereto made at the direction of Xilinx, which is referred to below as the “Xilinx adjusted AMD
projections.” For further information regarding the financial projections, see “-Xilinx Unaudited Financial
Projections” and “-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections.”

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to either Xilinx or AMD. In
evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of Xilinx, AMD or Morgan Stanley. These include, among other things, the
impact of competition on Xilinx or AMD’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Xilinx or AMD, and the
industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or
median) is not in and of itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Relative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of
a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such
company. Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated present value of the stand-alone unlevered after-tax free
cash flows that AMD and Xilinx were forecasted to generate during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020
through calendar year 2031, in the case of AMD, and during the second-half of fiscal year 2021 through fiscal
year 2032 in the case of Xilinx. For purposes of this analysis, unlevered after-tax free cash flows were
calculated using the following metrics: revenue, EBITDA (treating stock-based compensation as an expense),
EBIT (treating stock-based compensation as an expense), less taxes, adding depreciation, less change in net
working capital and less capital expenditures. Financial data used in this analysis was based on the Xilinx
adjusted AMD projections for the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020 through calendar year 2023 on a
standalone basis, in the case of AMD, and the Xilinx projections for Xilinx’s second half of fiscal year 2020
through fiscal year 2025, in the case of Xilinx. Morgan Stanley performed this analysis based on fully diluted
share counts as of October 20, 2020 provided by the respective managements of AMD and Xilinx, amounting
to a total of 252,117,021 shares of Xilinx common stock and 1,235,191,515 shares of AMD common stock.
Based on the foregoing, Morgan
124 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stanley calculated the terminal year unlevered after-tax free cash flow for AMD at $10,185 million and for Xilinx
at $2,509 million.
Morgan Stanley then estimated the terminal values of both AMD and Xilinx at the end of the forecast period
by using terminal EBITDA multiples ranging from 11.0x to 15.0x, which multiples were selected upon the
application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, after reviewing and comparing certain
financial estimates for each of Xilinx and AMD with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst
research estimates for the selected comparable companies described in “ -Relative Public Trading Multiples
Analysis.” The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of September 30, 2020
using discount rates ranging from 8.3% to 10.3%, in the case of AMD, and 6.8% to 7.8%, in the case of Xilinx,
which discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and
experience, to reflect a weighted average cost of capital calculation for AMD and Xilinx, respectively, taking
into account estimated market risk premium, risk free rate, betas, pre-tax cost of debt and debt to total
capitalization and other factors. The resulting aggregate values were then adjusted for net debt, taking into
account a net debt balance of $1,096 million for Xilinx as of September 26, 2020 and $1,459 million for AMD as
of October 14, 2020.
Morgan Stanley calculated the high end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the highest per share price for
Xilinx resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above by the lowest per share price for
AMD resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above. Morgan Stanley calculated the
low end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the lowest per share price for Xilinx resulting from the
application of the relevant multiples described above by the highest per share price for AMD resulting from
the application of the relevant multiples described above. Based on the foregoing, Morgan Stanley calculated
the following implied exchange ratio reference range:

Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial
analysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Xilinx board of directors,
including the following information described below under “-Precedent Premia Analysis,” “-Relative Historical
Exchange Ratio” and “-Relative Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.”
Precedent Premia Analysis
Morgan Stanley reviewed, based on publicly available information, the premiums paid in selected acquisition
transactions in the United States.
Morgan Stanley considered premiums paid in transactions since 2010 in which the consideration was stock
and which had an equity value of $1.0 billion or more and in which the acquiring company stockholders
retained ownership of between 20% and 40% in the combined company. The premiums paid in such
transactions represented a (i) median and mean of 19.2% with respect to one-day spot exchange ratio
premiums to unaffected prices and (ii) median of 20.9% and mean of 19.2% with respect to 30-trading day
exchange ratio premiums to unaffected prices.
125 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on this analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected reference premium ranges of (i)
12.6% to 23.8% to apply to Xilinx’s closing stock price on October 8, 2020 and (ii) 13.4% to 26.4% to apply to
Xilinx’s closing stock price for the 30-trading day average ending on October 8, 2020.
Morgan Stanley then calculated the exchange ratio implied by dividing the reference ranges for a share of
Xilinx common stock derived from the precedent premia analyses by the unaffected closing price for AMD
common stock. The analyses indicated the following implied the following implied exchange ratio ranges:
Exchange Ratio Premia Paid
Implied Transaction 
Exchange Ratio
Range
1-day Exchange-Ratio Premium (12.6%-23.8%)
1.3795x - 1.5168x
30-day Avg. Exchange-Ratio Premium (13.4%-26.4%)
1.4271x - 1.5910x
No company or transaction utilized as a comparison in the analysis of selected precedent premia transactions
is identical to Xilinx or AMD, or directly comparable to the merger in business mix, timing and size or other
metrics. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing necessarily involves complex considerations
and judgments concerning differences between the merger and the other transactions, Xilinx and AMD and
other factors. In evaluating the precedent premia transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and
assumptions with regard to the applicable transactions, size, business mix, governance matters, industry
performance, geographic mix, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Xilinx or AMD. Mathematical analyses (such as determining the mean or median) are
not in themselves a meaningful method of using comparable data.
Relative Historical Exchange Ratio
Morgan Stanley reviewed the range of the ratio of closing prices of Xilinx common stock divided by the
corresponding closing prices of AMD common stock over the 52-week period ended on October 8, 2020 (the
last full unaffected trading day prior to the market rumors regarding the transaction). For the 52-week period
reviewed, Morgan Stanley observed the relevant range of low and high exchange ratios.

Relative Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed future public market trading price targets for AMD common stock and Xilinx
common stock prepared and published by selected equity research analysts prior to October 8, 2020 (the last
full unaffected trading day prior to the market rumors regarding the transaction). These forward targets
reflected each analyst’s estimate of the 12-month future public market trading price of AMD common stock
and Xilinx common stock. Morgan Stanley also discounted such 12-month future market trading price
estimates by the cost of equity for AMD and Xilinx, respectively.

General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Xilinx board of directors, Morgan Stanley performed a
variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex process and not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole
and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes
that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have
given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the
actual value of AMD or Xilinx. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions
with regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions
and other matters, which are beyond the control of AMD or Xilinx. Any estimates contained in Morgan
Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.​
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement to the holders of shares of
Xilinx common stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares) and in connection with the delivery of its
opinion, dated October 26, 2020, to the Xilinx board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of AMD common stock or Xilinx common stock might
actually trade.
The exchange ratio was determined by AMD and Xilinx through arm’s-length negotiations between AMD and
Xilinx and approved by the Xilinx board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Xilinx board of
directors during these negotiations. Morgan Stanley did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio
to Xilinx or the Xilinx board of directors or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate
exchange ratio for the merger.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Xilinx board of directors was one of many factors taken
into consideration by the Xilinx board of directors in deciding to approve the merger agreement and approve
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Consequently, the analyses as described above
should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Xilinx board of directors with respect to the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Xilinx board of directors would have been
willing to agree to a different exchange ratio. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of
Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary
practice.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any
holder of shares of Xilinx common stock or AMD common stock as to how to vote or act on any matter with
respect to the merger or related transactions or any other action with respect to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address any other aspect of the merger or related
transactions, including the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business
transaction, or other alternatives, the prices at which shares of AMD common stock or Xilinx common stock
would trade at any time in the future, or the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any
officers, directors or employees of any party to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the
exchange ratio.
128 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The Xilinx board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications,
experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,
investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in
securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives
trading, and prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory
services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or
manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise
structure and effect transactions, for their own account or for the accounts of their customers, in debt or
equity securities or loans of Xilinx, AMD and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any currency
or commodity, that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or any related
derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided Xilinx with financial advisory services and
a financial opinion in connection with the merger, described in this section and attached as Annex D hereto,
and for such services Xilinx has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a transaction fee of $70 million, which is
contingent upon the closing of the merger (other than $5 million paid upon public announcement of the
merger), and up to an additional $40 million calculated based on the extent to which the value of Xilinx’s
shares in the merger immediately prior to closing (as measured by the trading price of the AMD common stock
received in the merger) exceeds a specified threshold. Based on the trading price of AMD common stock on
March 4, 2021, the additional fee payable to Morgan Stanley would be approximately $19 million. $5 million of
the transaction fee was paid upon the public announcement of the merger, and the remainder is contingent
upon the closing of the merger. Xilinx has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable
expenses, including reasonable fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in
connection with its engagement. In addition, Xilinx has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates,
their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan
Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses relating to or arising out of Morgan
Stanley’s engagement. In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have
provided financing services to Xilinx and received aggregate fees of less than $3 million from Xilinx in
connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its
affiliates have not provided any financial advisory or financing services to AMD, and, accordingly, have not
received fees for such services from AMD during this time. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial
advisory and financing services to Xilinx and AMD and their respective affiliates in the future and would
expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Opinion of BofA Securities
After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor, given the
magnitude of the potential transaction, importance of the investment decision and also because it would be
helpful to have a second perspective while going through the process, Xilinx retained BofA Securities to act
as one of its financial advisors in connection with the merger. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. Xilinx selected BofA
Securities to act as Xilinx’s financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of BofA Securities’
experience in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity

accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of Xilinx management that they
were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or

AMD and Xilinx and the other matters covered thereby and, based on the assessments of Xilinx management
as to the relative likelihood of achieving the future financial results reflected in the AMD projections and the

modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining
the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Xilinx, AMD or the contemplated

transactions that might be available to Xilinx or in which Xilinx might engage or as to the underlying business
decision of Xilinx to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion with
respect to, and relied, with the consent of Xilinx, upon the assessments of representatives of Xilinx regarding,

BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies,
calculated as equity values, based on closing stock prices on October 23, 2020, plus debt, less cash and cash
equivalents, as a multiple of calendar year 2021 and calendar year 2022 estimated earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciations and amortization, commonly referred to as “EBITDA,” treating stock-based compensation
as an expense and excluding amortization of acquired intangibles and one-time, non-recurring items, which is
referred
132 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to as “adjusted EBITDA.” BofA Securities also reviewed per share equity values of the selected publicly
traded companies, based on closing stock prices on October 23, 2020, as a multiple of calendar year 2021 and
calendar year 2022 estimated earnings per share, commonly referred to as “EPS,” treating stock-based
compensation as an expense and excluding amortization of acquired intangibles and one-time, non-recurring
items, which is referred to as “adjusted EPS.” The mean and median enterprise value / estimated adjusted
EBITDA multiples observed for the tier 1 selected publicly traded companies were 32.4x and 42.8x,
respectively, for calendar year 2021 and 27.4x and 37.9x for calendar year 2022, and the mean and median
enterprise value / estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples for the other selected publicly traded companies were
27.7x and 19.0x, respectively, for calendar year 2021 and 24.9x and 17.8x, respectively, for calendar year 2022.
The mean and median price / estimated adjusted EPS multiples observed for the tier 1 selected publicly traded
companies were 41.6x and 55.5x, respectively, for calendar year 2021 and 34.3x and 45.9x, respectively, for
calendar year 2022, and the mean and median price / estimated adjusted EPS multiples observed for the other
selected publicly traded companies were 34.6x and 23.4x, respectively, for calendar year 2021 and 30.6x and
20.2x, respectively, for calendar year 2022.
BofA Securities then applied calendar year 2021 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples of 21.5x to 36.0x and
calendar year 2022 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples of 19.0x to 30.5x derived from the selected publicly
traded companies to Xilinx’s calendar year 2021 and calendar year 2022 estimated adjusted EBITDA and
applied calendar year 2021 estimated adjusted EPS multiples of 28.5x to 45.5x and calendar year 2022 estimated
adjusted EPS multiples of 24.5x to 37.0x derived from the selected publicly traded companies to Xilinx’s
calendar year 2021 and calendar year 2022 estimated adjusted EPS. Estimated financial data of the selected
publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated
financial data of Xilinx were based on the Xilinx projections. This analysis indicated the following approximate
implied per share equity value reference ranges for Xilinx, as compared to the per share price of Xilinx common
stock implied by the exchange ratio in the merger, calculated based on the closing price of AMD common
stock on October 23, 2020, multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded to the nearest $0.25):

None of the selected companies identified as meeting BofA Securities’ selection criteria were excluded from
the analysis. No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Xilinx. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which Xilinx was compared.

BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise value implied for the target company based on
the consideration payable in the selected transaction as a multiple of the target company’s next twelve
months, which is referred to as “NTM,” estimated adjusted EBITDA and the price paid in the selected
transaction as a multiple of the target company’s NTM estimated adjusted EPS. The mean and median
enterprise value / NTM estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were
21.3x and 22.2x, respectively, and the mean and median price / NTM estimated adjusted EPS multiples
observed for the selected transactions were 29.6x and 27.5x, respectively.
BofA Securities then applied NTM estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples of 18.0x to 29.0x derived from the
selected transactions to Xilinx’s NTM estimated adjusted EBITDA and applied NTM estimated adjusted EPS
multiples of 27.5x to 42.5x derived from the selected transactions to Xilinx’s NTM estimated adjusted EPS.
Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time
of announcement of the relevant transaction, and estimated financial data of Xilinx were based on the Xilinx
projections. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges

characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business
segments or transactions to which Xilinx and the merger were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Xilinx to calculate the estimated present value
of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Xilinx was forecasted to generate during Xilinx’s
third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021 and fiscal years 2022 through fiscal year 2032 based on the Xilinx
projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for Xilinx by applying to Xilinx’s estimated standalone
unlevered, after-tax free cash flow of $2,456 million in the terminal year a range of perpetuity growth rates of
2.75% to 3.25%, which perpetuity growth rates were selected based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment
and experience and input from Xilinx management. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted
to present value, assuming a mid-year convention, as of September 30, 2020 using discount rates ranging from
6.5% to 8.5%, which were based on an estimate of Xilinx’s weighted average cost of capital, derived using the
capital asset pricing model, which took into account, among other things, risk free rate, unlevered beta, and
historical equity risk premium and BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience. From the resulting
enterprise values, BofA Securities added net cash of $1,096 million to derive equity values.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of AMD to calculate the estimated present value
of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that AMD was forecasted to generate during AMD’s
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and fiscal years 2021 through 2031 based on the Xilinx adjusted AMD
projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for AMD by applying to AMD’s estimated standalone
unlevered, after-tax free cash flow of $10,051 million in the terminal year a range of perpetuity growth rates of
3.50% to 4.00%, which perpetuity growth rates were selected based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment
and experience and input from Xilinx management. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted
to present value, assuming a mid-year convention, as of September 30, 2020 using discount rates ranging from
8.50% to 10.50%, which were based on an estimate of AMD’s weighted average cost of capital, derived using
the capital asset pricing model, which took into account, among other things, risk free rate, unlevered beta,
and historical equity risk premium and BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience. From the
resulting enterprise values, BofA Securities added net cash of $1,459 million to derive equity values.

Summary of Material Relative Financial Analyses
Implied Exchange Ratio Analysis-Selected Companies Analysis
Utilizing the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for Xilinx and AMD described above
under “-Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis” for each of Xilinx and AMD, as applicable, by dividing
the low endpoint and the high endpoint of the per share equity reference range derived for Xilinx by the high
endpoint and low endpoint of the per share equity reference range derived for AMD, respectively, without
taking into account the potential pro forma financial effect of the estimated cost savings, BofA Securities
calculated the approximate implied exchange ratio reference ranges. This analysis yielded the following
approximate implied exchange ratio reference ranges, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger:

endpoint and the high endpoint of the per share equity reference range derived for Xilinx by the high endpoint
and low endpoint of the per share equity reference range derived for AMD, respectively, without taking into
account the potential pro forma financial effect of the estimated cost savings, BofA Securities calculated the
approximate implied exchange ratio reference range. This analysis yielded the following approximate implied

Pro Forma Analysis
BofA Securities performed a pro forma analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for the Xilinx
stockholders resulting from the merger based on a comparison of (i) the pro forma ownership by Xilinx
stockholders of the combined company following the merger and (ii) the 100% ownership by Xilinx
stockholders of the Xilinx common stock on a stand-alone basis. For Xilinx on a stand-alone basis, BofA
Securities used the reference range obtained in its discounted cash flow analysis described above under “-
Material Xilinx Financial Analyses-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.” BofA Securities then calculated the
implied pro forma equity value per share of Xilinx common stock resulting from the merger as follows:
the implied equity value of Xilinx on a standalone basis plus the implied equity value of AMD on a
standalone basis (each as calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis described above);
plus the implied equity value of net estimated cost savings to the combined company applying a
perpetuity growth rate of 2.75% to 3.25% and a discount rate range of 6.5% to 8.5% (based on the
perpetuity growth rates and discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analysis with respect to
Xilinx as described above); and
less the decrease in cash from the merger to the combined company.

Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion under “-Summary of Material Xilinx Financial Analyses,” “-Summary of
Material AMD Financial Analyses” and “-Summary of Material Relative Financial Analyses” represents a brief
summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Xilinx board of directors in
connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by BofA
Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and
the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not
readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses
summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of
its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific
analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given
greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Xilinx and AMD. The estimates of the
future performance of Xilinx and AMD in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
those estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part
of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio and were
provided to the Xilinx board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or
the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the
estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual
values of Xilinx or AMD.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between
Xilinx and AMD, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Xilinx board of directors. The
139 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Xilinx board of directors. As described
above, BofA Securities’ opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Xilinx board of
directors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Xilinx
board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio.
Xilinx has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of $20
million, $4 million of which was payable in connection with its opinion and the remainder of which is
contingent upon the completion of the merger. Xilinx also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA
Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in
securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal
investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management,
financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of
companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its
affiliates invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long
or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Xilinx, AMD and
certain of their respective affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may
provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Xilinx and have received or in
the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted as joint
book running manager for a debt offering of Xilinx, (ii) having acted or acting as lender under certain term
loans, letters of credit and other credit facilities for Xilinx, (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury
management services and products to Xilinx and (iv) having provided or providing certain derivatives and
foreign exchange trading services to Xilinx. From October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020, BofA Securities
and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Xilinx of approximately $4 million for investment and
corporate banking services.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the
future may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to AMD and have
received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having
acted or acting as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner for, and a lender under, certain term loans, letters of
credit and other credit facilities of AMD, (ii) having provided or providing certain treasury management
services and products to AMD and (iii) having provided or providing certain derivatives and foreign exchange
trading services to AMD. From October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020, BofA Securities and its affiliates
derived aggregate revenues from AMD of approximately $16 million for investment and corporate banking
services.​
AMD Unaudited Financial Projections
In connection with the merger, AMD management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial
information of AMD for its 2020 through 2023 fiscal years, which AMD management then extrapolated for
AMD’s 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. These projections and extrapolations are referred to together as the “AMD
projections.” Also in connection with the merger, AMD received certain unaudited prospective financial
information concerning Xilinx for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, which AMD management adjusted to
moderate the growth rate to reflect the competitive environment and to provide for a December year end.
These adjusted projections for the years ending December 2020 through December 2025 are referred to as the
“AMD adjusted Xilinx projections.” The AMD projections were prepared for internal use only and were
provided to the AMD board of directors for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger.
The AMD projections were also provided to AMD’s financial advisors, DBO and Credit Suisse, in connection
with rendering their respective fairness
140 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
opinions to the AMD board of directors and in performing the related analyses. The AMD projections for
AMD’s 2020 through 2023 fiscal years (but not the extrapolations for AMD’s 2024 and 2025 fiscal years) were
also provided to Xilinx management in connection with its consideration and evaluation of the merger and to
Xilinx’s financial advisors, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities. The AMD projections and, to the knowledge
of AMD, the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections, were prepared treating each of AMD and Xilinx on a stand-
alone basis, without giving effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger,
the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, the potential synergies that
may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect of any business or strategic
decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or
the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the merger
agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in
anticipation of the merger. In connection with the merger, AMD management also independently and
collaboratively prepared with Xilinx management certain estimates of annual cost synergies expected to be
realized following the closing, which are referred to as the “estimated synergies” and are summarized under “-
Certain Estimated Synergies.” These estimated synergies are not reflected in the financial projections prepared
by AMD or by Xilinx.
AMD historically provides quarterly, annual and long-term financial guidance to investors. Long-term
forecasts or projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results are subject to risks, due
to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future
periods and the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the financial projections
by AMD are being included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to give stockholders access to certain
non-public information provided to the AMD board of directors and AMD’s financial advisors and to Xilinx
and its financial advisors for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger. The inclusion of the financial
projections by AMD should not be regarded as an indication that the AMD board of directors, AMD, the
Xilinx board of directors, Xilinx, DBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities or any other recipient of
this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an
accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.
The accompanying financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies were not prepared with a view
toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines established by the
SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective
financial information, or GAAP, but, in the view of AMD management, were, or, in the case of the AMD
adjusted Xilinx projections, assumed to have been, prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting the best
available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation, to
the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future
financial performance of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be
relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the financial projections by AMD or the
estimated synergies. Although AMD management believes there is, or, in the case of the AMD adjusted Xilinx
projections, assumed there was, a reasonable basis for the financial projections by AMD and the estimated
synergies, AMD cautions stockholders that future results could be materially different from the financial
projections by AMD and the estimated synergies. This summary of the financial projections by AMD and the
estimated synergies is not being included in this joint proxy statement/​prospectus to influence any decision
on whether to vote for the AMD share issuance proposal or the Xilinx merger proposal, but rather because the
financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies were shared between AMD and Xilinx and provided
to AMD’s and Xilinx’s respective boards of directors and financial advisors for purposes of considering and
evaluating the merger and the merger agreement. AMD’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst
& Young LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect
to the financial projections by AMD and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance with respect thereto.​
The financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies are subject to estimates and assumptions in
many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the
financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies are based upon a variety of estimates and
assumptions that are
141 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by AMD management, or, in the case of the AMD
adjusted Xilinx projections, assumed to be reasonable, as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and
assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, including general economic conditions,
industry capital spending and unit production trends, competition and the risks discussed under “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” See also “Where You Can Find More
Information.” The financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies also reflect assumptions as to
certain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the financial projections by AMD were
developed for AMD on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to the merger, they do not reflect any
divestitures or other restrictions that may be imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary
governmental or regulatory approvals, any synergies that may be realized as a result of the merger or any
changes to AMD’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the merger. There can
be no assurance that the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies will be realized, and actual
results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which financial
projections by AMD and the estimated synergies relate, the less predictable and more unreliable the
information becomes.
The financial projections by AMD contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that AMD believes are
helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. AMD management regularly uses a
variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring
financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While AMD believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide
meaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze AMD’s financial and
business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP
financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not
reported by all of AMD’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of
AMD’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.
Neither AMD nor Xilinx has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in these
projections to the comparable GAAP measure due to no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP
measures for these measures and the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the measures that are
necessary for such reconciliation.
None of AMD, Xilinx, the combined company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the financial projections by
AMD or the estimated synergies, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise
or reconcile, the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies to reflect circumstances existing
after the date the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies were generated or to reflect the
occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying financial
projections by AMD or the estimated synergies, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by
applicable laws, AMD does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the financial
projections by AMD or the estimated synergies, even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be
in error. None of AMD or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes
any representation to any AMD stockholder or other person regarding AMD’s ultimate performance compared
to the information contained in the financial projections by AMD, the estimated synergies or that forecasted
results will be achieved. AMD has made no representation to Xilinx, in the merger agreement or otherwise,
concerning the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies.
AMD has not obtained, and does not intend to obtain, updated, revised or reaffirmed opinions from DBO and
Credit Suisse, and AMD has not updated, revised or reaffirmed, and does not intend to update, revise or
reaffirm, any of the projections or assumptions that it provided to DBO and Credit Suisse and upon which
DBO and Credit Suisse based their respective opinions. The opinions of DBO and Credit Suisse do not speak
as to the time when the merger will be completed or to any other date other than the date of each opinion. See
“-Opinions of AMD’s Financial Advisors.” Further, the projections that AMD provided to DBO and Credit
Suisse were not necessarily indicative of the results that AMD will achieve for any period ending after the
date of the opinions.

Unlevered free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to Adjusted EBITDA less stock-based
compensation which is treated as a cash expense, less taxes, change in net working capital and capital
expenditures.
Summary of the AMD Adjusted Xilinx Projections
In addition, as described under “-Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections,” Xilinx management prepared certain
unaudited prospective financial information concerning Xilinx for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, which were
provided to AMD and which AMD management adjusted to moderate the growth rate to reflect the
competitive environment and to provide for a December year end. These projections, as so adjusted, are

Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections
Other than its quarterly financial guidance and business outlook, which may be updated from time to time,
Xilinx does not as a matter of course make other public projections as to future revenues, earnings or other
results available. In particular, Xilinx does not as a matter of course make public long-term projections or
forecasts as to its future revenues, earnings or other results due to the uncertainty of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the merger, Xilinx management shared its five-year
long-range plan, which is referred to as the “LRP.” The LRP is updated each year and reviewed with the Xilinx
board of directors in the fiscal year-end timeframe, coinciding with Xilinx year-end procedures. Xilinx shared
the LRP projections with AMD and the supporting financial advisors, including BofA Securities, Credit
Suisse, DBO and Morgan Stanley, with certain minor variations in the LRP projections provided to AMD and
the financial advisors for each of AMD and Xilinx as described below under “-Summary of Xilinx Financial
Projections.” Also in connection with the merger, Xilinx received certain unaudited prospective financial
information concerning AMD for fiscal years 2020 through 2023, which Xilinx management adjusted to
moderate the growth rate to reflect the competitive environment. These adjusted projections for the years
ending December 2020 through December 2023 are referred to as the “Xilinx adjusted AMD projections.” The
LRP, the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections, the Xilinx LRP extrapolations as described below under “-Summary
of Xilinx Financial Projections” and the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections as described below under “-Summary
of Xilinx Adjusted AMD Projections” are referred to collectively as the “Xilinx unaudited projections.”
Because the LRP was prepared before the COVID-19 pandemic was well-understood and before the 2020 U.S.
Department of Commerce rule changes for trade with Huawei and other customers in China, Xilinx management
also provided a revised forecast, solely for revenue, updated for those environmental headwinds, as further
discussed below. Xilinx shared the revenue forecast update with AMD and the supporting financial advisors,
including BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, DBO and Morgan Stanley.
The Xilinx unaudited projections were prepared treating Xilinx and AMD, respectively, on a standalone basis,
without giving effect to the merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the merger, the
expenses that may be incurred in connection with the merger or the consummation thereof, the potential
synergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect of any business
or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been
executed or in anticipation of the merger, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which
would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered,
would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered,
accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. In connection with the merger, Xilinx and
AMD management also prepared and agreed certain estimates of the annual cost synergies estimated to be
recognized by the combined company in connection with the merger. The estimated synergies are not reflected
in the Xilinx unaudited projections.​
The Xilinx unaudited projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward
compliance with the published guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or GAAP, but, in the view of
Xilinx management were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting the best available estimates and judgments
at the time of preparation and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of management’s knowledge
and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of Xilinx. However, this
information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and
readers of this joint proxy statement / prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Xilinx
unaudited projections or the estimated synergies. Although Xilinx management believes there is a reasonable
basis for the Xilinx unaudited projections, Xilinx cautions stockholders that future results could be materially
different from the
144 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
unaudited projections. This summary of the Xilinx unaudited projections is not being included in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus to influence any decision whether to vote for the Xilinx merger proposal, but
because the Xilinx unaudited projections were provided to Xilinx’s financial advisors and the Xilinx board of
directors for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger. The prospective financial information of
Xilinx included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,
Xilinx management. Xilinx’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has not
audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the financial
projections by Xilinx and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with
respect thereto.
The Xilinx unaudited projections, the AMD projections and the estimated synergies are subject to estimates
and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical
specificity, the Xilinx unaudited projections, the AMD projections and the estimated synergies are based upon
a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by
Xilinx’s management or, in the case of the unaudited prospective financial information provided by AMD that
formed the basis for the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections, assumed to have been reasonable, as of the date of
their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons,
including general economic conditions, trends in the semiconductor industry, including trends in capital
spending, inventory and unit production, competition and the risks discussed under “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” Also see “Where You Can Find More
Information.” The Xilinx unaudited projections, the AMD projections and the estimated synergies also reflect
assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the Xilinx unaudited
projections and the AMD projections were developed for Xilinx and AMD, respectively, on a standalone basis
without giving effect to the merger, they do not reflect any divestitures or other restrictions that may be
imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, any synergies
that may be realized as a result of the merger or any changes to Xilinx’s or AMD’s operations or strategy that
may be implemented after completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that the Xilinx unaudited
projections, the AMD projections or the estimated synergies will be realized, and actual results may differ
materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the Xilinx unaudited projections
and the estimated synergies relate, the less predictable and more unreliable the information becomes.
The Xilinx unaudited projections and the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections contain certain non-GAAP
financial measures that Xilinx believes are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future
results. Xilinx management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with
GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are
not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Xilinx
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors
understand the operating results and to analyze Xilinx’s financial and business trends on a period-to-period
basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP
financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of Xilinx’s competitors
(including AMD) and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Xilinx’s competitors
(including AMD) due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.
None of Xilinx, AMD, the combined company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Xilinx unaudited
projections, the AMD projections or the estimated synergies, and none of them undertakes any obligation to
update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Xilinx unaudited projections, the AMD projections or the
estimated synergies to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Xilinx unaudited projections, the AMD
projections or the estimated synergies were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the
event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Xilinx unaudited projections or the estimated
synergies, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Xilinx does
not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Xilinx unaudited projections or the
estimated synergies, even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of Xilinx or
its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any
Xilinx stockholder or other person regarding Xilinx’s ultimate performance compared to the information
contained in the Xilinx unaudited

projections, the AMD projections or the estimated synergies or that forecasted results will be achieved. Xilinx
has made no representation to AMD, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Xilinx unaudited
projections or the estimated synergies.
Xilinx has not obtained, and does not intend to obtain, updated, revised or reaffirmed opinions from Morgan
Stanley and BofA Securities, and Xilinx has not updated, revised or reaffirmed, and does not intend to update,
revise or reaffirm, any of the projections or assumptions that it provided to Morgan Stanley and BofA
Securities and upon which Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities based their respective opinions. The opinions
of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities do not speak as to the time when the merger will be completed or to
any other date other than the date of each opinion. See “-Opinions of Xilinx’s Financial Advisors.” Further,
the projections that Xilinx provided to Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities were not necessarily indicative of
the results that Xilinx or AMD will achieve for any period ending after the date of the opinions. However, as of
the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and except as otherwise publicly disclosed, Xilinx is not
aware of, and does not anticipate to occur before the Xilinx special meeting, any material change or anticipated
material change in its operations or performance, or to the projections or assumptions upon which Morgan
Stanley and BofA Securities based their respective opinions, since the date of such opinions.

Non-GAAP Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to net income excluding the impact of
acquisition-related and non-recurring expenses, including the income tax effect of non-GAAP
adjustments. Non-GAAP Net Income includes SBC expense.
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization, excluding the impact of acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items, but
including SBC expense.
Adjusted earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to earnings per share adjusted to
exclude the effects of acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items, but including SBC
expense. Adjusted earnings per share is based on the non-GAAP projected effective tax rates and
projected share counts set forth below.

taxes, less change in net working capital, less capital expenditures, plus depreciation and amortization.
SBC expense is included in operating income which is treated as a cash expense in this table.
An earlier version of the LRP prepared by Xilinx management and shared with AMD and the financial
advisors for each of AMD and Xilinx included certain immaterial variations. Specifically, an earlier version
of the LRP reflected Adjusted EBITDA of $1,080 million in FY2021, $1,134 million in FY2022, $1,286 million
in FY2023, $1,481 million in FY2024 and $1,874 million in FY2025. In one presentation, FY2021 Adjusted
EBITDA was shown as $1,081 million, FY2021 unlevered free cash flow was shown as $815 million
(including SBC expense) and FY2025 unlevered free cash flow was shown as $1,461 (including SBC
expense).

Because the LRP was developed before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and before the new and more
restrictive U.S. Department of Commerce trade rules with certain products and Chinese customers, Xilinx
provided an updated revenue forecast, highlighting some impact to near-term revenues, but that the longer-
range revenue forecast and outlook remained consistent. Xilinx provided the update to its revenue forecast to
AMD management and the supporting financial advisors, including BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, DBO and
Morgan Stanley.

Xilinx also provided an update on EPS expected for fiscal year 2021, given the latest Xilinx fiscal 2021 third
quarter outlook. The adjusted EPS was $2.80 burdened by SBC and $3.66 unburdened by SBC. Xilinx provided
or made available the update to its EPS to AMD management and the supporting financial advisors, including
BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, DBO and Morgan Stanley.
The following table presents certain unaudited prospective financial information of Xilinx prepared at the
direction of, and approved by, Xilinx management for Xilinx’s fiscal years ending 2026 through 2032, which we
refer to as the “Xilinx LRP extrapolations.” The Xilinx LRP extrapolations incorporated assumptions of more
moderate long-term revenue growth and maturing profitability in the years following the LRP. At the direction
of Xilinx, Xilinx’s financial advisors used the Xilinx LRP extrapolations in their respective analyses included in
the fairness opinions presented to the Xilinx board of directors.

Summary of the Xilinx Adjusted AMD Projections
In addition, as described under “-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections,” AMD management prepared certain
unaudited prospective financial information concerning AMD for fiscal years 2020 through 2023, which were
provided to Xilinx and which Xilinx management adjusted to moderate the growth rate to reflect a modestly
lower market share forecast in anticipation of a very competitive market; specifically, the 2021E, 2022E and
2023E Revenue were adjusted by approximately (1.6)%, (1.0)% and (3.7)%, respectively. These projections, as
so adjusted, are presented in the following table on bases both including and excluding SBC.

Certain Estimated Synergies
In August and September 2020, AMD and Xilinx management both independently and collaboratively prepared
estimates of certain synergies estimated to be potentially realizable by the combined company in connection
with the proposed merger. AMD and Xilinx management agreed that the estimated synergies include
approximately $300 million of cost synergies estimated to be potentially realizable within 18 months
subsequent to closing, which are referred to as the “estimated synergies.” The estimated synergies were
provided to the AMD and Xilinx boards of directors and to their respective financial advisors.
The estimated synergies assumed that the expected benefits of the merger would be realized, including that no
restrictions, terms or other conditions would be imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary
governmental, regulatory or other approvals or consents in connection with the consummation of the merger.
See “-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections” and “-Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections” for further
information regarding the uncertainties underlying the estimated synergies, as well as under “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for further information regarding the
uncertainties and factors associated with realizing the synergies in connection with the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place on a date to be designated jointly by AMD and Xilinx, which date will
be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted) of the last of
the conditions to closing (described under “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Completion of the
Merger”) to be satisfied or waived (other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions at the closing), unless another
date is agreed to in writing by AMD and Xilinx.
At the closing, the parties to the merger agreement will cause a certificate of merger relating to the merger to
be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or
recordings required by the DGCL in connection with effecting the merger. The merger will become effective at
the time when the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as may be agreed to in writing by AMD and Xilinx and specified in the certificate of merger.
AMD and Xilinx currently expect the merger to close by the end of the 2021 calendar year and are working to
complete the merger on this timeline and prior to the end date of October 26, 2021 (which is subject to
extension in certain circumstances related to the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the absence of
restraints under certain competition laws to January 26, 2022 or April 26, 2022 pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement). However, it is possible that factors outside the control of the parties to the merger
agreement could result in the merger being completed at a different time, or not at all.
Regulatory Approvals
Under the merger agreement, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have each agreed to cooperate with each other and
to use (and to cause their respective subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to cause the conditions to the closing to be
satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the end date) and to
consummate the merger, including to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) the regulatory
approvals described above as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the end
date), subject to the limitations described below. In the event that any lawsuit or other legal proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, is commenced challenging the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement as violative of any competition law, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx will
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to defend any such lawsuit or legal
proceeding.
However, AMD will not be required to do any of the following in order to obtain any regulatory approval or
otherwise to consummate the merger, and any requirement to do any of the following in order to obtain a
required regulatory approval would result in the conditions to the consummation of the merger not being
satisfied, unless waived by AMD: (a) sell, divest, exclusively license, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of,
or (b) grant any non-exclusive license, accept any operational restrictions or take or commit to any actions
which restrictions or actions would limit AMD’s or any of its affiliates’ freedom of action, in each case with
respect to assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of AMD, Xilinx or either’s respective
subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse
effect on (A) Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (B) AMD and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole),
but for purposes of clause (B), deemed to be the same size as Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, without the prior written consent of AMD, neither Xilinx nor any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates will grant or offer to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or
otherwise) to any third party in connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.
If reaching agreement with the applicable governmental entity would require AMD to agree to or effect any
undertaking in excess of the limitations described above, AMD may either agree to or effect such an
undertaking
149 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
or continue to attempt to obtain approval of the applicable governmental entity. If such an agreement is not
reached or undertaking not effected prior to the end date, the conditions to the closing of the merger would
not be satisfied and either company would be permitted to terminate the merger agreement. AMD would be
required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion if the merger agreement is terminated:
by AMD or Xilinx pursuant to the right of either party to terminate the merger agreement if the merger
has not been consummated by the end date and as of such termination the only conditions to closing
that were not satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are satisfied on the closing
date, provided such conditions would have been capable of satisfaction if the closing occurred on
the termination date) were the condition related to illegality or injunction arising under competition
laws or the condition related to receipt of regulatory approvals; or
by AMD or Xilinx due to the existence of a final and non-appealable order or law that permanently
restrains, enjoins or makes illegal consummation of the merger and the law is a competition law or the
order is issued pursuant to a competition law and all other conditions to AMD’s obligation to close
would have been capable of satisfaction if the closing occurred on the termination date.
AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have agreed that AMD will have the ultimate right to devise the strategy and
direct all matters for all filings, notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any filing,
notice, petition, statement, registration, submission, application or similar regulatory approval, taking into
account in good faith any comments of Xilinx. However, each party will consult and coordinate with each
other with respect to interactions with and filings submitted to the government. Additionally, each party is
required to (a) promptly notify the other parties to the merger agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other
parties with copies of, any communication from or to any governmental entity regarding the merger, (b) permit
the other parties to the merger agreement to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any governmental entity and
(c) to the extent permitted by the applicable governmental entity, give the other parties reasonable opportunity
to attend and participate in any in-person meetings, video conferences or teleconferences with such
governmental entity regarding the merger.
See “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Merger.”
Ownership of the Combined Company
Based on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock outstanding on February 10, 2021, the latest
practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, upon completion of the merger,
former Xilinx stockholders are expected to own approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of AMD
common stock and AMD stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately
74.1% of the outstanding shares of AMD common stock. The relative ownership interests of AMD
stockholders and former Xilinx stockholders in the combined company immediately following the merger will
depend on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the merger.
Board of Directors of the Combined Company
AMD has agreed to appoint at least two members of the Xilinx board of directors to the AMD board of
directors as of the effective time, with such directors to hold office until the earliest to occur of the
appointment or election and qualification of his or her respective successor or his or her death, resignation,
disqualification or proper removal. Each such director must qualify as an “independent director” under
applicable Nasdaq rules and regulations and will be designated by the AMD board of directors after
reasonable consultation with, and reasonable consideration of, the recommendations of Xilinx. AMD has
agreed to nominate such directors for reelection at the first annual meeting of AMD stockholders that occurs
after the closing.
U.S. Federal Securities Law Consequences
Assuming the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy
statement/​prospectus forms a part, the shares of AMD common stock issued in the merger will not be subject
to any
150 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except for shares of AMD
common stock issued to any Xilinx stockholder who may be deemed an “affiliate” of AMD after the
completion of the merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of shares of AMD
common stock received by any person upon the completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to
make any use of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, or the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this
joint proxy statement/​prospectus forms a part, in connection with any resale of shares of AMD common stock.
Accounting Treatment
AMD prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD
representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. AMD will record assets acquired, including
identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their respective fair values at the date of
completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described in Note 2 (Basis of Pro Forma
Presentation) to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements) over the net fair value of
such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.
The financial condition and results of operations of AMD after completion of the merger will reflect Xilinx after
completion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or
results of operations of Xilinx. The earnings of AMD following completion of the merger will reflect
acquisition accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value for assets and
liabilities on depreciation expense and amortization expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including
goodwill, will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and
intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the
future, AMD determines that tangible or intangible assets (including goodwill) are impaired, AMD would
record an impairment charge at that time.
Litigation Relating to the Merger
On December 7, 2020, a purported Xilinx stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California against Xilinx and the Xilinx board of directors, captioned Stein v. Xilinx, Inc., et
al., Case No. 5:20-cv-08637 (N.D. Cal.) (the “Stein Complaint”). On December 11, 2020, a purported Xilinx
stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against Xilinx and the Xilinx

(the “Stanisci Complaint” and, together with the Stein Complaint, the Hale Complaint, the Nunez Complaint,
the Shumacher Complaint, the Achterberg Complaint, the Vazirani Complaint, the Sandhu Complaint, the Stein
II Complaint and the Murphy Complaint, the “Complaints”). On February 17, 2021, the Hale Complaint was
voluntarily dismissed.
The Stein Complaint, the Hale Complaint, the Shumacher Complaint, the Achterberg Complaint, the Vazirani
Complaint, the Sandhu Complaint, the Stein II Complaint, the Murphy Complaint and the Stanisci Complaint
assert claims against certain defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder for allegedly false and misleading statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and against
certain defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged “control person” liability with respect
to such allegedly false and misleading statements. The Nunez Complaint and the Stanisci Complaint assert
that the members of the Xilinx board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger
by purportedly failing to disclose material information about the merger. The the Nunez Complaint also asserts
that the members of the Xilinx board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger
by purportedly failing to obtain adequate consideration, and that AMD, Xilinx and Merger Sub aided and
abetted the Xilinx board of directors’ breach. Each Complaint seeks, among other relief, an order enjoining the
merger and an award for plaintiffs’ fees and costs. The Stein Complaint, the Nunez Complaint and the
Achterberg Complaint also seek damages in an unspecified amount. AMD and Xilinx believe the allegations in
the Complaints are without merit.
AMD and/or Xilinx stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the merger, which may name AMD,
Xilinx, members of the AMD or Xilinx boards of directors and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be
made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or the Complaints, including the amount of costs associated with
defending, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of, such claims.
Exchange of Shares
Prior to the closing date, AMD will select its transfer agent or, after consultation with Xilinx, another reputable
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to both parties to act as exchange agent with respect to the
merger. At or prior to the effective time, AMD will deposit with the exchange agent (a) certificates or evidence
of book-entry shares representing the shares of AMD common stock issuable pursuant to the merger
agreement and (b) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with the merger
agreement.
At the effective time, each share of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and all holders of Xilinx stock certificates
and of Xilinx book-entry shares (each as defined under “The Merger Agreement-Exchange of Shares”) will
cease to have any rights as Xilinx stockholders, except the right to receive the merger consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares, and any dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement.
As promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to each holder of
record of shares of Xilinx common stock that are represented by a stock certificate (a) a notice advising such
holder of the effectiveness of the merger, (b) a letter of transmittal and (c) instructions for surrendering such
holder’s Xilinx stock certificates in exchange for the merger consideration.
Holders of Xilinx stock certificates, after providing the proper documentation to the exchange agent, will
receive from the exchange agent a statement reflecting the shares of AMD common stock such holder was
entitled to receive (in book-entry form) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock to which
such holders are entitled (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes).
Holders of book-entry shares of Xilinx common stock, whether through DTC or otherwise, will not be required
to take any specific actions to exchange their shares of Xilinx common stock for shares of AMD common
stock. Book-entry shares not held through DTC will be exchanged for shares of AMD common stock (in book-
entry
152 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
form) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock to which such holders are entitled without
any action on the part of the applicable holder. AMD, Xilinx and the exchange agent will implement customary
procedures with respect to the surrender and exchange of shares held of record by DTC and its nominees.
More information can be found under “The Merger Agreement-Exchange of Shares.”
Listing of AMD Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of Xilinx Common Stock
It is a condition of the merger that the shares of AMD common stock to be issued to Xilinx stockholders in the
merger be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance.
If the merger is completed, Xilinx common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the
Exchange Act, and Xilinx will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Xilinx
common stock.
Xilinx has agreed to cooperate with AMD and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable laws and Nasdaq rules and policies to enable the delisting by the combined company of the shares
of Xilinx common stock from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the shares of Xilinx common stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the effective time.

XILINX INC_20210305_DEFM14A_19107214_4148221.Pdf,THE MERGER AGREEMENT,"THE MERGER AGREEMENT
The following description sets forth the principal terms of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex
A hereto and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The rights and obligations
of the parties are governed by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this
description, which is summary by nature. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement. You are encouraged to read the
merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as well as this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
documents incorporated by reference herein, before making any decisions regarding any of the proposals
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This section is intended to provide you with information
regarding the terms of the merger agreement. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information
provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the public filings AMD and Xilinx make
with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information
regarding the terms of the merger agreement. AMD and Xilinx are responsible for considering whether
additional disclosure of material information is required to make the statements in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus not misleading. Factual disclosures about AMD and Xilinx contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and in the public filings AMD and Xilinx make with the SEC may supplement, update or
modify the factual disclosures about AMD and Xilinx contained in the merger agreement and described in this
summary. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by AMD, Merger Sub
and Xilinx are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the parties to the merger agreement in
connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is
important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement, and were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the
parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties
may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from that generally relevant
to stockholders or applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases are qualified by
confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the
merger agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement
will not survive the completion of the merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement. If specific material facts
exist that contradict the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement, AMD
and Xilinx have disclosed those material facts in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. If subsequent
information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
merger agreement has not been reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, each of AMD and Xilinx will
make publicly available any material information necessary to provide stockholders a materially complete
understanding of the provisions of the merger agreement.For the foregoing reasons, the representations,
warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead
should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
in the public filings AMD and Xilinx make with the SEC.
Additional information about AMD and Xilinx can be found elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and in the public filings AMD and Xilinx make with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find
More Information.”
Structure of the Merger
At the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Xilinx in accordance with the DGCL and on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, whereupon the separate existence of 
154 • 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger Sub will cease and Xilinx will be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD. At
the effective time, all of the property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of Xilinx and Merger Sub will
vest in Xilinx as the surviving corporation, and all of the debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties
of Xilinx and Merger Sub will become debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of Xilinx as the
surviving corporation.
Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place on a date to be designated jointly by AMD and Xilinx, which date will
be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted) of the last of
the conditions to closing (described under “-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger”) to be satisfied or
waived (other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions at the closing), unless another date is agreed to in writing by
AMD and Xilinx. The date on which the closing occurs is referred to as the “closing date.”
At the closing, the parties to the merger agreement will cause a certificate of merger relating to the merger to
be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or
recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the merger. The merger will become effective at the time
when the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time
as may be agreed to in writing by AMD and Xilinx and specified in the certificate of merger.
Merger Consideration
At the effective time, automatically, by virtue of the merger and without any further action on the part of
Xilinx, Xilinx stockholders, AMD or Merger Sub:
all shares of Xilinx common stock that are held in treasury by Xilinx or are held directly by AMD or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no
consideration will be paid or payable in respect thereof;
except as described in the preceding bullet, each share of Xilinx common stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive, without
interest, 1.7234 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of AMD common stock; and
each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Xilinx as the surviving corporation.
Treatment of Fractional Shares
No fractional shares of AMD common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Each Xilinx
stockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive in the merger a fractional share of AMD
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement will, in lieu of such fractional share and upon surrender of
such holder’s certificates representing shares of Xilinx common stock or book-entry positions representing
non-certificated shares of Xilinx common stock, in each case outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest and
subject to any required tax withholding, determined by multiplying such fraction by the average of the
volume-weighted average trading prices per share of AMD common stock on Nasdaq (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P.) on each of the five consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that is
three trading days prior to the date of the effective time. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of AMD common stock that would otherwise have
been issuable as part of the merger consideration. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests
merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

agreement) of (a) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock plus (b) any unpaid
cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the merger agreement.
With respect to book-entry positions representing non-certificated shares of Xilinx common stock, which are

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Xilinx common stock that is not registered in Xilinx’s
transfer records, the exchange agent may deliver the merger consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of AMD common stock to such transferee if:
in the case of Xilinx book-entry shares, written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Xilinx
book-entry shares are presented to the exchange agent;
in the case of Xilinx stock certificates, the Xilinx stock certificates formerly representing such shares
of Xilinx common stock are surrendered to the exchange agent; and
such Xilinx stock certificates or Xilinx book-entry shares are presented to the exchange agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to AMD and the exchange agent.
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
In the event that any Xilinx stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Xilinx stock certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting by such person of a bond in a reasonable and customary amount and upon such terms as may
reasonably be required as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Xilinx
stock certificate, the exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Xilinx stock
certificate, the merger consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock, and any
unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, payable or issuable
pursuant to the merger agreement, as if such lost, stolen or destroyed Xilinx stock certificate had been
surrendered.
Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Xilinx Common Stock
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of AMD common stock with a
record date after the effective time will be paid or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered
Xilinx stock certificate or Xilinx book-entry shares with respect to the shares of AMD common stock that such
holder has the right to receive in the merger until the later to occur of:
the date on which the holder surrenders such Xilinx stock certificate or Xilinx book-entry shares in
accordance with the merger agreement; and
the payment date for such dividend or distribution with respect to shares of AMD common stock (at
which time such holder will be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest).
Rights of Xilinx Stockholders Following the Effective Time and Transfers Following the Effective Time
At the effective time, all shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will
automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and all holders of Xilinx stock certificates and of
Xilinx book-entry shares will cease to have any rights as Xilinx stockholders, except the right to receive the
merger consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock, and any dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the merger agreement.
Neither AMD nor Xilinx as the surviving corporation will be liable to any holder or former holder of shares of
Xilinx common stock or to any other person with respect to any portion of the merger consideration delivered
to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or other similar law. If
any Xilinx stock certificate or Xilinx book-entry share has not been surrendered prior to the date on which any
portion of the merger consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case, that a holder of such
Xilinx stock certificate or Xilinx book-entry share has the right to receive pursuant to the merger agreement in
respect of

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
such Xilinx stock certificate or Xilinx book-entry share would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
governmental entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Xilinx stock
certificate or Xilinx book-entry share will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
AMD, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.
Withholding Rights
AMD, the exchange agent, Merger Sub, Xilinx and Xilinx as the surviving corporation will each be entitled to
deduct and withhold any amounts required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to applicable tax laws from
the amounts that would otherwise be payable under the terms of the merger agreement. Any such amounts
that are deducted or withheld and, if required, paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities will be
treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
Treatment of Xilinx Equity Awards
Xilinx RSUs
At the effective time, each outstanding award of Xilinx RSUs with vesting criteria based solely on continuing
service that is held by a Xilinx employee immediately prior to the effective time, will be automatically
converted into AMD RSU denominated in shares of AMD common stock based on the exchange ratio.
At the effective time, each outstanding award of Xilinx RSUs with performance-based vesting criteria that is
held by a Xilinx employee immediately prior to the effective time, after Xilinx’s determination of Xilinx RSUs
earned (based on actual or, if consummation of the merger occurs during or after Xilinx’s 2022 fiscal year, the
greater of target-level and actual, performance through a date that is at least ten business days prior to the
effective time), will be (to the extent earned) automatically converted into AMD RSUs denominated in shares
of AMD common stock based on the exchange ratio, and all unearned performance-based Xilinx RSUs will be
forfeited.
Aside from the foregoing adjustments, Xilinx RSUs will generally remain subject to the same vesting and other
terms and conditions that applied to such awards immediately prior to the effective time.
Xilinx Options
At the effective time, any outstanding Xilinx Option held by a Xilinx employee will be automatically converted
into an option to acquire a number of shares of AMD common stock determined based on the exchange ratio
(with the exercise price with respect to such option being adjusted based on the exchange ratio).
Aside from the foregoing adjustments, Xilinx Options, if any, will generally remain subject to the same vesting
and other terms and conditions that applied to such awards immediately prior to the effective time.
Xilinx Non-Employee Director Equity Awards
At the effective time, the vesting of each outstanding Xilinx Option, whether vested or unvested, and each
outstanding Xilinx RSU, held by a non-employee member of the Xilinx board of directors, will accelerate in full
and, in the case of Xilinx RSUs, become settled.
Xilinx Employee Stock Purchase Plan
For Xilinx’s Amended and Restated 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan, which is referred to as the
“ESPP,” Xilinx is required to take the following actions: (a) any offering period under the ESPP in effect as of
payroll date occurring prior to the Closing will be shortened by setting a new exercise date for such offering
period that is no later than such payroll date, and on the new exercise date, cause each outstanding purchase

under the ESPP to be exercised on that date; and (b) as of the new exercise date, the ESPP will be suspended,
and no offering periods or purchase periods will commence thereafter and no payroll deductions or other
contributions will be made thereafter for the ESPP.
Governance of the Combined Company

directors as of the effective time, with such directors to hold office until the earliest to occur of the
appointment or election and qualification of his or her respective successor or his or her death, resignation,
disqualification or proper 
removal. Each such director must qualify as an “independent director” under applicable Nasdaq rules and
regulations and will be designated by the AMD board of directors after reasonable consultation with, and
reasonable consideration of, the recommendations of Xilinx. AMD has agreed to nominate such directors for
reelection at the first annual meeting of AMD stockholders that occurs after the closing.​
Dr. Lisa Su will lead the combined company as Chief Executive Officer. Victor Peng, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Xilinx, will join AMD as President responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth
initiatives, effective upon closing of the merger.
Organizational Documents and Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation
Subject to the requirements described under “-Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance,” at the
effective time:
the certificate of incorporation of Xilinx, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, except
that the name of the surviving corporation will be “Xilinx, Inc.”; and
the parties will take all requisite actions so that the bylaws of Xilinx will be amended and restated in
their entirety to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective

bylaws will remain in effect as Article VI of the surviving corporation.
The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will become the initial directors
and officers of Xilinx as the surviving corporation.

to or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar document, agreement,

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to, in the case of AMD, obtaining approval of the
AMD share issuance proposal, or, in the case of Xilinx, obtaining approval of the Xilinx merger proposal,
AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, and their respective representatives may engage or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with, and provide information to, any person that has made a bona fide written
acquisition proposal after the date of the merger agreement that did not result from any breach of the
foregoing restrictions by AMD or Xilinx, their subsidiaries, or any of their representatives, as applicable, if:
prior to taking such action, the AMD or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, receiving such
acquisition proposal determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal (as defined
below) or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that failure to engage in
such discussions or negotiations, or provide such information, would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the AMD or Xilinx board of directors to AMD or Xilinx, as
applicable, and its respective stockholders under applicable laws; and
prior to providing any information regarding AMD or Xilinx or any of their respective subsidiaries, as
applicable, to such third party in response to such acquisition proposal, AMD or Xilinx, as applicable,
receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement with nondisclosure provisions at
least as restrictive as the non-disclosure agreement with AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, and which
does not prohibit the compliance of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, with the merger agreement’s non-
solicitation provisions.
AMD and Xilinx have also agreed that prior to or substantially concurrently with providing any non-public
information to such third party, AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, will make such non-public information available
to each other.
AMD and Xilinx have further agreed that they will not, and will cause their respective affiliates not to, release
any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to enforce,
any standstill provision in any agreement to which AMD or Xilinx, or any of their respective affiliates, as
applicable, is a party.
An “acquisition proposal” means any offer, indication of interest or proposal contemplating or otherwise
relating to an alternative transaction (as defined below).
An “alternative transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the merger)
involving:
any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture,
reorganization or other similar transaction involving AMD or Xilinx, as applicable;
any acquisition by any person or group of persons of 25% or more of the outstanding voting power
of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, or any transaction in which AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, issues
securities representing 25% or more of the outstanding voting power of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable;

any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group of
persons acquiring beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the voting power of AMD or Xilinx, as
applicable; or
any combination of the foregoing if the sum of the percentage of the voting power of AMD or Xilinx,
as applicable, or of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of AMD and its subsidiaries
or of Xilinx and its subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole, involved is 25% or more.
A “superior proposal” means any bona fide, unsolicited written acquisition proposal made after the date of the
merger agreement that:
if consummated, would result in any person or group of persons directly or indirectly becoming the
beneficial owner of (a) any business or businesses that constitute or account for 50% or more of the
net revenues, net income or assets of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, or (b) 50% or more of the
outstanding total voting power of the equity securities of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable; and
the AMD board of directors or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, is reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed and which, taking into account such factors as the AMD board
of directors or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, considers to be appropriate or relevant,
including the timing, likelihood of consummation, confidentiality, legal, financial, regulatory, financing
and other aspects of such acquisition proposal would be more favorable to the holders of shares of
common stock of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement (after giving effect to any revisions to the terms of the merger
agreement proposed by AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, in response to such acquisition proposal
pursuant to the merger agreement).
Existing Discussions or Negotiations; Notice Regarding Acquisition Proposals
AMD and Xilinx have agreed that they will, and that they will cause their respective subsidiaries and their and
their respective representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of,
or discussions or negotiations with any person (other than AMD or Xilinx, as applicable) that was ongoing at
the execution of the merger agreement and any access any such persons may have to any physical or
electronic data room relating to any potential acquisition proposal.
AMD and Xilinx have also agreed that if either of them receives an acquisition proposal or any inquiry or
request for information with respect to an acquisition proposal or that is reasonably likely to lead to an
acquisition proposal, then AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, will promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours after
its receipt of such acquisition proposal or request) notify the other party in writing of such acquisition
proposal or request (which notification must include the identity of the person making or submitting such
request or acquisition proposal and an unredacted copy of any such written request or proposal (or, if not in
writing, the material terms and conditions thereof)), together with copies of any proposed transaction
agreements. AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, must keep the other party reasonably informed in writing, on a
current basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of the status of such acquisition proposal or request,
including informing the other party of any material change to the terms of such proposal, and the status of
any negotiations, including any change in its intentions as previously notified.

No Change of Recommendation
AMD and Xilinx have agreed that, except as otherwise set forth in the merger agreement, neither the AMD nor
Xilinx board of directors, will:
withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify (or publicly propose to do so), in a manner adverse to
AMD and Merger Sub, on the one hand, or to Xilinx, on the other hand, the Xilinx board of directors’
required recommendation to Xilinx stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, which is referred to
as the “Xilinx recommendation,” or the AMD board of directors’ required recommendation to AMD
stockholders to approve the share issuance, which is referred to as the “AMD recommendation,” as
applicable;
approve, recommend or declare advisable (or publicly propose to do so) any acquisition proposal;
fail to publicly announce, within ten business days after a tender exchange offer relating to the equity
securities of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, have been commenced by any third party (and in no event 
later than one business day prior to the date of the Xilinx special meeting or the AMD special
meeting, as applicable, as either may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to this merger agreement),
a statement disclosing that the Xilinx board of directors or AMD board of directors, as applicable,
recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer, with such board’s taking of no position or a
neutral position in respect of the acceptance of any such tender or exchange offer constituting a
failure to publicly announce that such board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;
if requested by the other party, fail to issue, within ten business days after an acquisition proposal is
publicly announced (and in no event later than one business day before the date of the Xilinx special
meeting or the AMD special meeting, as applicable, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to
the merger agreement), a press release reaffirming the Xilinx recommendation or the AMD
recommendation, as applicable (any actions described in this bullet and the preceding three bullets
are referred to as a “change of recommendation”);
cause or permit AMD or Xilinx, as the case may be, to enter into any contract, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or other arrangement or understanding (other
than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with the merger agreement) contemplating
or relating to an acquisition transaction;
take any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation
inapplicable to any acquisition proposal or counterparty thereto; or
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.
Permitted Change of Recommendation-Superior Proposal
However, Xilinx, at any time prior to its stockholders voting on the Xilinx merger proposal, and AMD, at any
time prior to its stockholders voting on the AMD share issuance proposal, may make a change of
recommendation related to an acquisition proposal and authorize termination of the merger agreement if and
only if AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, receives from a third party a bona fide written acquisition proposal that
has not been withdrawn and that did not result from a breach of the merger agreement’s non-solicitation
provisions, if, prior to making such change of recommendation and/or authorizing termination of the merger
agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal:
the recipient’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the recipient’s board
of directors’ fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable laws;
the recipient delivers to the other party a written notice at least four business days in advance stating
that the recipient’s board intends to make a change of recommendation and/or terminate the merger
agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal;
168

TABLE OF CONTENTS
during such four business day period, if requested by the other party, the recipient engages in good
faith negotiations with the other party regarding a possible amendment of the merger agreement so
that the acquisition proposal that is the subject of the superior proposal notice ceases to be a
superior proposal; and
after the expiration of such four business day period, the recipient’s board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, after taking into
account any amendments to the merger agreement that the other party has committed to in writing,
that such acquisition proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal.
If there is any change to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such acquisition proposal,
the acquisition proposal’s recipient must deliver to the other party an additional notice, and a new negotiation
period will commence equal to the longer of three business days and the period remaining under the original
four business day notice period.
In the case of terminating the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior
proposal, AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, shall have paid, or caused the payment of, the applicable termination
fee in accordance with the merger agreement and described under “-Termination of the Merger Agreement.”
Permitted Change of Recommendation-Intervening Event
In addition, Xilinx, at any time prior to its stockholders voting on the Xilinx merger proposal, and AMD, at any
time prior to its stockholders voting on the AMD share issuance proposal, may make a change of
recommendation if an intervening event (as defined below) arises and prior to making such change of
recommendation:
the Xilinx board of directors or AMD board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that, in light of such intervening
event, a failure to effect a change of recommendation would be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with such board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable laws;
the party experiencing the intervening event delivers to the other party a written notice at least four
business days in advance stating that the board of directors intends to make a change of
recommendation;
during such four business day period, if requested by the other party, the party experiencing the
intervening event engages in good faith negotiations with the other party regarding a possible
amendment of the merger agreement that obviates the need for such change of recommendation; and
after the expiration of such four business day period, the party experiencing the intervening event
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and,
after taking into account any amendments to the merger agreement that the other party has committed
to in writing, that in light of such intervening event, a failure to make a change of recommendation
would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the board of directors’ fiduciary duties to its
stockholders under applicable laws.
An “intervening event” means any state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance, occurrence or
development, or combination thereof, that arises following the date of the merger agreement that (a) was
neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Xilinx board of directors or AMD board of directors, as
applicable, as of the date of the merger agreement (or, if known to or reasonably foreseeable by such board,
the consequences of which were neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by such board as of the date of
the merger agreement) and (b) is material to AMD and any of its subsidiaries or Xilinx and any of its
subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole, and (c) is not related to:

exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of its revenue, earnings or other
financial performance or results of operations for any period (except that any underlying cause of any
of the foregoing may be taken into account unless excluded pursuant the other bullet points);
any event, condition or circumstance related to AMD and any of its subsidiaries or Xilinx and any of
its subsidiaries, as applicable; or
any changes in applicable laws.
Special Meetings
As promptly as reasonably practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part is declared effective by the SEC (and in any event within 45 days
thereafter), AMD and Xilinx must take all actions necessary to, in the case of AMD, convene the AMD special
meeting and, in the case of Xilinx, convene the Xilinx special meeting. Except as described above with respect
to a change of recommendation, AMD and Xilinx must use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of
their respective proposals. AMD and Xilinx must also use reasonable best efforts to initially hold their
respective special meetings on the same date or, if notwithstanding such efforts, the other party’s special
meeting is held on a date prior, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the other party’s
special meeting.
AMD and Xilinx may postpone or adjourn the AMD and Xilinx special meetings, as applicable, if the other
party provides its prior written consent and:
to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus which the AMD or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, has determined in
good faith, after consultation with the other party and its outside counsel, is required by applicable
law is disclosed and promptly disseminated to AMD or Xilinx stockholders, as applicable, prior to
such special meeting;
if required by applicable law or a request from the SEC; or
if, as of the time for which the AMD or Xilinx special meeting, as applicable, is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock, as applicable, represented to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at such special meeting.
In addition, AMD or Xilinx may, and if the other party so requests at any time prior to four months after the
registration statement on Form S-4 becomes effective, must, postpone or adjourn the AMD or Xilinx special
meeting, as applicable, in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the AMD share issuance proposal or
Xilinx merger proposal, as applicable, if on the date for which such special meeting is scheduled, there would
be insufficient votes to obtain approval of such proposal, whether or not a quorum is present. In such case,
except where the AMD or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, has made a change of recommendation in
compliance with the merger agreement, AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, must use reasonable best efforts to
solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of such proposal as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, without AMD’s or Xilinx’s consent, as applicable, no single adjournment or postponement may be
for more than five business days, and, subject to certain exceptions, all such adjournments and
postponements together may not postpone the AMD or Xilinx special meeting, as applicable, for more than 20
business days.
Furthermore, unless the merger agreement is earlier terminated (including in order to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a superior proposal), nothing in the merger agreement, including a change of
recommendation by AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, will relieve either party of its obligation to submit to its
stockholders for a vote the AMD share issuance proposal or the Xilinx merger proposal, as applicable.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Regulatory Approvals
Under the merger agreement, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have each agreed to cooperate with each other and
to use (and to cause their respective subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to cause the conditions to the closing to be
satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the end date) and to
consummate the merger, including to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) the regulatory
approvals described above as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the end
date), subject to the limitations described below. In the event that any lawsuit or other legal proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, is commenced challenging the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement as violative of any competition law, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx will
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to defend any such lawsuit or legal
proceeding.
However, AMD will not be required to do any of the following in order to obtain any regulatory approval or
otherwise to consummate the merger, and any requirement to do any of the following in order to obtain a
required regulatory approval would result in the conditions to the consummation of the merger not being
satisfied, unless waived by AMD: (a) sell, divest, exclusively license, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of,
or (b) grant any non-exclusive license, accept any operational restrictions or take or commit to any actions
which restrictions or actions would limit AMD’s or any of its affiliates’ freedom of action, in each case with
respect to assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of AMD, Xilinx or either’s respective
subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse
effect on (A) Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (B) AMD and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole),
but for purposes of clause (B), deemed to be the same size as Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, without the prior written consent of AMD, neither Xilinx nor any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates will grant or offer to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or
otherwise) to any third party in connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.
If reaching agreement with the competition authorities would require AMD to agree to or effect any antitrust
restraint in excess of the limitations described above, AMD has the option to either agree to commit to or take
such actions or continue to attempt (with the continued cooperation of Xilinx) to obtain approval of the
competition authorities. If the required approvals and clearances are not obtained by the end date, either party
would have the ability to terminate the merger agreement. See “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the
Merger Agreement.”
AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have agreed that AMD will have the ultimate right to devise the strategy and
direct all matters for all filings, notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any filing,
notice, petition, statement, registration, submission, application or similar regulatory approval, taking into
account in good faith any comments of Xilinx. However, each party will consult and coordinate with each
other with respect to interactions with and filings submitted to the government. Additionally, each party is
required to (a) promptly notify the other parties to the merger agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other
parties with copies of, any communication from or to any governmental entity regarding the merger, (b) permit
the other parties to the merger agreement to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any governmental entity, and
(c) to the extent permitted by the applicable governmental entity, give the other parties reasonable opportunity
to attend and participate in any in-person meetings, video conferences or teleconferences with such
governmental entity regarding the merger.
Access to Information
Subject to certain limitations, prior to the effective time, each of AMD and Xilinx will afford the other party and
its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours upon prior notice, to AMD’s or Xilinx’s,
as applicable, and its subsidiaries’ personnel, properties, contracts, filings, books and records and, during
such period, will furnish promptly to the other party all available information concerning AMD’s or Xilinx’s, as
applicable, business as the other party may reasonably request.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Publicity
AMD and Xilinx must consult with one another prior to issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any public announcement or statement with respect to the merger agreement or
the merger and may not issue any such public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable law or by Nasdaq rules and regulations (in which event AMD or Xilinx, as
applicable, must endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such public announcement in advance, and must
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto). Notwithstanding
the foregoing:
each of AMD and Xilinx may make public announcements concerning the merger agreement or the
merger that consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous public announcements
made by AMD, Xilinx or both in compliance with the publicity provisions of the merger agreement;
each of AMD and Xilinx may make any public statements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so long as such
public statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by AMD, Xilinx or both in compliance with the publicity
provisions of the merger agreement;
Xilinx need not consult with AMD in connection with any public announcement or statement to be
made with respect to any acquisition proposal; and
AMD and Xilinx need not consult with the other party in connection with any public announcement
or, statement to be made with respect to any change of recommendation.
Employee Benefits Matters
For twelve months following the effective time, AMD will provide, or will cause to be provided, to each
employee of Xilinx and its subsidiaries who continues employment with AMD (a) a total target cash
opportunity that is not less favorable than the total target cash opportunity provided to each such employee
immediately prior to the effective time and (b) employee welfare and retirement benefits (excluding any
benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or post-retirement medical plan) that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than either (x) those provided to such continuing employee by Xilinx and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the effective time or (y) those provided to similarly situated employees of AMD.
AMD has agreed to, or to cause one of its subsidiaries to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms
the Xilinx “change of control” arrangements in effect on the date of the merger agreement.
AMD will provide service credit to continuing Xilinx employees for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and accrual and level of benefits with respect to AMD benefit plans. For its welfare benefit
plans, AMD will use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) waive limitations on preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods for continuing Xilinx employees, other than as are already in effect and have
not been satisfied or waived prior to the effective time, and (b) credit annual deductibles, co-payments and
out-of-pocket maximums paid under Xilinx benefit plans during the applicable plan year.
Xilinx is permitted to pay a pro-rated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which the effective time occurs, based
on actual performance for the portion of the applicable fiscal year completed prior to the effective time. AMD
will, or will cause one of its subsidiaries to, pay continuing Xilinx employees a prorated annual bonus for the
remaining portion of the fiscal year following the effective time or, if a prorated bonus amount is not paid to
continuing Xilinx employees by Xilinx prior to the effective time, annual bonuses for the full fiscal year of
Xilinx in which the effective time occurs, in each case, based on achievement of actual, or, in the event the
closing occurs during or after Xilinx’s fiscal year 2022, the greater of target and actual, performance metrics
through the end of such fiscal year, as AMD will reasonably determine.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certain Tax Matters
AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx intend to report and, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
“determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar state, local or non-U.S. legal
requirement), will report, for U.S., state and other relevant tax purposes, the merger as a “reorganization”
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, which is referred to as the “intended tax treatment.” Each of
AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx will use reasonable best efforts to cause the merger to qualify, and will not take
any action or cause any action to be taken which action would reasonably be expected to prevent the merger
from qualifying, for the intended tax treatment. The merger agreement is intended to constitute a “plan of
reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code (or any similar state, local or non-U.S. legal
requirement) and Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a), and each of AMD, Merger Sub and
Xilinx have adopted it as such.
Each of AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx will use reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion of counsel that the
merger qualifies for the intended tax treatment. AMD and Merger Sub and Xilinx, respectively, will deliver to
each of Latham & Watkins LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP a letter setting forth the tax
opinion representations and assumptions (as defined under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Xilinx Common Stock”). Each
of AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx will use reasonable best efforts not to, and not permit any affiliate to, take or
cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action
which inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the tax opinion representations and assumptions.
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
For at least six years following the effective time:
AMD and Xilinx as the surviving corporation must indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all current or former directors and officers of Xilinx or any of its
subsidiaries, any person who becomes a director or officer of Xilinx or any of its subsidiaries prior to
the effective time and any current or former director of officer of Xilinx or any of its subsidiaries who
is, was or at any time prior to the effective time does serve as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership joint venture, trust, pension plan or employee benefit
plan at the request of or for the benefit of Xilinx or any of its subsidiaries (which individuals are
referred to as the “indemnified parties”) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws; and
Xilinx as the surviving corporation must maintain in effect the provisions in the organizational
documents of Xilinx and each of its subsidiaries and other agreements of Xilinx or any of its
subsidiaries with any indemnified party, in each case, regarding exculpation, elimination or limitation
of liability, indemnification of officers, and directors or other fiduciaries and advancement of expenses
that are in existence on the date of the merger agreement (including acts or omissions in connection
with the approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger and the related
transactions) and set forth in Xilinx’s disclosure schedule, and no such provision may be amended,
modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of
any such indemnified party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the effective time (including with respect to the approval of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the merger) without the consent of such indemnified party.
Furthermore, for at least six years following the effective time, AMD and Xilinx as the surviving corporation
must maintain in effect Xilinx’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, which is referred to as
the “D&O Policy,” for claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the effective time
(including with respect to the approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger) and
covering each of Xilinx’s current directors and officers on terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are
no less favorable than those terms in effect on the date of the merger agreement. However, in no event will
AMD or Xilinx as the
173

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
surviving corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the current
annual premium paid by Xilinx for such insurance. Therefore, in lieu of the foregoing obligation, Xilinx may, or
if Xilinx is unable to, AMD may on its behalf, purchase, prior to the effective time, a six- year “tail” prepaid
policy on the D&O Policy with an annual cost not exceeding such 300% of the current annual premium paid by
Xilinx for such insurance. Each of the indemnified parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the
D&O Policy or such “tail” policy (and, after the death of any of the foregoing persons, such person’s heirs
and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of the merger agreement’s indemnification
provisions, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
Certain Additional Covenants
The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the
filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, regulatory filings and approvals (which are described under
entitled “The Merger-Regulatory Approvals”), the delisting of shares of Xilinx common stock from Nasdaq

respect to litigation relating to the merger and termination of Xilinx’s revolving credit facility.

(a) by AMD if prior to obtaining required stockholder approval, (x) the AMD board of directors shall
have authorized the party to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior proposal, (y)
concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement, AMD enters into the definitive agreement
relating to a superior proposal and pays the other party the applicable termination fee pursuant to the
merger agreement, and (z) AMD has otherwise complied in all respects (other than de minimis
noncompliance unrelated to such superior proposal) with the applicable no solicitation of acquisition
proposals and special meetings provisions of the merger agreement, or (b) by either AMD or Xilinx (x)
if the merger has not been consummated on or prior to close of business on the end date or (y) due to
the failure of AMD to obtain approval by AMD stockholders of the Xilinx share issuance proposal, in
each of the previous cases, at a time when Xilinx would have been entitled to terminate the merger
agreement if AMD has failed to include the AMD recommendation in the joint proxy
statement/​prospectus or has made a change of recommendation, prior to AMD obtaining its required
stockholder approval;
by either AMD or Xilinx due to the failure of AMD to obtain approval by AMD stockholders of the
Xilinx share issuance proposal;
by Xilinx, subject to certain exceptions, if (a) any of AMD’s representations and warranties contained
in the merger agreement shall be inaccurate such that the conditions to the completion of the merger
would not be satisfied or (b) any of AMD’s covenants contained in the merger agreement shall have
been breached such that the conditions to the completion of the merger would not be satisfied; or
by either AMD or Xilinx if the merger has not been consummated on or prior to close of business on
the end date at a time when the merger agreement could have been terminated pursuant to the above
bullet point; and
for previous three bullet points, (x) at or prior to the AMD special meeting or triggering breach, an
intention to make an acquisition proposal shall have been publicly announced or an acquisition
proposal for AMD has been publicly disclosed, publicly announced, commenced, submitted or made

TABLE OF CONTENTS
and has not been publicly withdrawn without qualification at least five business days prior to the
AMD special meeting or the triggering breach and (y) within 12 months after termination of the
merger agreement, either (i) an alternative transaction with respect to AMD is consummated or (ii) a
definitive agreement relating to an alternative transaction is entered into by AMD (except that the
parties have agreed that in the case of a definitive agreement being entered into as described in this
clause (ii), each reference to “25%” in the definition of alternative transaction will be deemed to be a
reference to “50%”).
AMD will be obligated to pay to Xilinx a regulatory termination fee of $1.0 billion in cash if the merger
agreement is terminated:
by either AMD or Xilinx because the merger has not been consummated by the end date and the only
conditions to closing yet to be satisfied are those relating to competition laws; or
by either AMD or Xilinx, when the other conditions to AMD’s obligations to close would have been
satisfied or would have been capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on the date notice
of termination was delivered, due to a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction entering or
issuing a final and non-appealable order or adopting or enacting a final and non-appeal law, in either
case, relating to antitrust, that permanently prevents, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of
the merger.
A termination fee will be payable by AMD only once and not in duplication even though a termination fee may
be payable by AMD pursuant to more than one of the circumstances described above.
Post-Termination Liability
Except in the case of fraud or in the case of intentional and material breach of the merger agreement, if a party
receives a termination fee, then the receipt of the termination fee will be the receiving party’s sole and
exclusive remedy against the paying party, its affiliates and its and their respective representatives in
connection with the merger agreement.
Amendment and Waiver
The merger agreement may be amended at any time prior to the effective time by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties to the merger agreement, except that:
if the AMD share issuance proposal is approved, no amendment may be made which by applicable
law or Nasdaq rule or regulation requires further approval of AMD stockholders without the further
approval of such AMD stockholders; and
if the Xilinx merger proposal is approved, no amendment may be made which by applicable law or
Nasdaq rule or regulation requires further approval of Xilinx stockholders without the further
approval of such Xilinx stockholders.
Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition therein may be waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver. Any such waiver will
not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. No failure on the part
of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under the merger agreement, and no delay on the
part of any party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under the merger agreement, will operate
as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right,
privilege or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or
remedy.

XILINX INC_20210305_DEFM14A_19107214_4148221.Pdf,UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,"UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On October 26, 2020, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which
Merger Sub will merge with and into Xilinx, with Xilinx as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of AMD. Upon successful completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Xilinx
common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the separate historical
financial statements and related notes of AMD and Xilinx, and the other information regarding AMD and
Xilinx that is contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on and have been derived from
the historical financial statements of AMD and Xilinx, including AMD’s audited consolidated statement of
operations for its fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and audited consolidated balance sheet as of December
26, 2020, and Xilinx’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended
March 28, 2020, unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
January 2, 2021, and unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2021. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation
S-X.
AMD’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December of each year and Xilinx’s fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest March 31 of each year. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations is presented on the basis of AMD’s fiscal year and combine the historical results of the fiscal
periods of AMD and Xilinx. Since AMD’s and Xilinx’s fiscal year ends differ by more than 93 days, pursuant
to Rule 11-02(c)(3) of Regulation S-X, AMD combines its statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
December 26, 2020 and those of Xilinx for each of the three months ended March 28, 2020, June 27, 2020,
September 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements are presented on the basis of AMD’s fiscal year and combine the historical results of the fiscal
periods of AMD and Xilinx. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines AMD’s
audited balance sheet as of December 26, 2020 and Xilinx’s unaudited balance sheet as of January 2, 2021.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred
on December 26, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal
year ended December 26, 2020 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on December 29, 2019. In the
opinion of AMD management, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect
adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information as of and for the periods indicated, and the pro forma adjustments are based on currently available
information and assumptions AMD believes are factually supportable, directly attributable to the merger and,
with respect to the statement of operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined
company.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s financial position or results
of operations actually would have been had the merger occurred as of the dates indicated. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements also should not be considered indicative of the future results
of operations or financial position of AMD or Xilinx.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations and unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet give pro forma effect to the consummation of the merger on the terms provided for in
the merger agreement. The unaudited merger pro forma adjustments reflect adjustments related to the
application of the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the merger and the preliminary fair
value estimate of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed.
181 TABLE OF CONTENTS
The merger is subject to closing adjustments that have not yet been finalized. Accordingly, the pro forma
adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements as required by SEC rules. Differences between these preliminary
estimates and the final merger accounting may be material.

Note 1-Description of the Merger
On October 26, 2020, AMD entered into the merger agreement, by and among AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx,
pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Xilinx, with Xilinx surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD.
Under the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Xilinx common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time (other than treasury shares and any shares of Xilinx common stock held
directly by AMD or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 fully paid and non-
assessable shares of AMD common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to any
applicable withholding.
At the effective time, (i) all Xilinx RSUs with vesting criteria based on continuing service that are outstanding
and held by Xilinx employees immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into
restricted stock units denominated in shares of AMD common stock based on the exchange ratio, (ii) all Xilinx
RSUs with performance-based vesting criteria that are outstanding and held by Xilinx employees immediately
prior to the effective time, after giving effect to Xilinx’s determination, based on actual, or, in the event
consummation of the merger occurs during or after Xilinx’s fiscal year 2022, the greater of target-level and
actual, performance through a date that is not less than ten business days prior to the effective time, of Xilinx
RSUs earned, will be (to the extent earned) automatically converted into restricted stock units denominated in
shares of AMD common stock based on the exchange ratio and all unearned performance-based Xilinx RSUs
forfeited, (iii) all Xilinx options held by Xilinx employees that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time (if any) will be automatically converted into options to acquire a number of shares of AMD
common stock determined based on the exchange ratio (with the exercise price being adjusted based on the
exchange ratio) and (iv) all Xilinx options and Xilinx RSUs held by non-employee members of the Xilinx board
of directors shall accelerate in full and, in the case of Xilinx RSUs, become settled. Aside from the foregoing
adjustments, the awards will generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions that
applied to the awards immediately prior to the effective time.
The merger has been unanimously approved by the respective AMD and Xilinx boards of directors. However,
the merger is subject to approval by AMD and Xilinx stockholders, certain regulatory approvals and other
customary closing conditions. The merger is currently expected to close by the end of calendar year 2021.
Note 2-Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared in
accordance with Article 11 of SEC Regulation S-X. AMD has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the last
Saturday in December and Xilinx has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31.
To comply with SEC rules and regulations for companies with different fiscal year ends, the pro forma
condensed combined financial statements have been prepared utilizing periods that differ by less than 93
days. Given the different fiscal year ends of AMD and Xilinx, the Xilinx historical unaudited condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended January 2, 2021 is derived from the
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for each of the three months ended March 28,
2020, June 27, 2020, September 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021. The AMD historical unaudited condensed
financial statement of operations data are derived from AMD’s audited consolidated financial statements for
the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred
on December 26, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal
year ended December 26, 2020 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on December 29, 2019, the
beginning of AMD’s fiscal 2020 year. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations
is presented on the basis of AMD’s fiscal year and combines the historical results of the fiscal periods of
AMD and Xilinx. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines AMD’s audited
consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2020 and Xilinx’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of
January 2, 2021.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using the
acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the business combination provisions of ASC 805,
Business Combinations, with AMD representing the acquirer under this guidance. In the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet, AMD’s costs to acquire Xilinx have been allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, based upon management’s preliminary estimate of what their respective fair values
would be as of the date of the merger. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and are based upon available
information and certain assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and
which are described in the accompanying notes herein. Actual results may differ materially from the
assumptions within the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
Under ASC 805, generally all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair
value. For purposes of the pro forma information presented herein, the fair value of Xilinx’s identifiable
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on a preliminary estimate of fair
value. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill. Management believes the estimated fair values
utilized for the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed are based on reasonable estimates and
assumptions. Certain current market-based assumptions were used which will be updated upon completion of
the merger. Preliminary fair value estimates may change as additional information becomes available and such
changes could be material, as certain valuations and other studies have yet to commence or progress to a
stage where there is sufficient information for definitive measurement, including inventory, property and
equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and their related tax impact. Following the consummation of the
merger, management will conduct a final review. As a result of that review, management may identify
differences that, when finalized, could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to matters that are (i) directly
attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the statement of operations,
expected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any anticipated
synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the merger transactions or of any
integration costs.
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with:
the separate historical audited consolidated financial statements of AMD for the year ended
December 26, 2020, included in AMD’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 29,
2021;
the separate historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Xilinx as of and for
the nine months ended January 2, 2021, included in Xilinx’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with
the SEC on January 28, 2021; and
the separate historical audited consolidated financial statements of Xilinx for the year ended March
28, 2020, included in Xilinx’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 8, 2020.
Note 3-Conforming Accounting Policies
At this time, AMD is not aware of any material differences between the accounting policies of the two
companies that would continue to exist subsequent to the application of acquisition accounting. Following
the consummation of the merger, AMD will conduct a more detailed review of Xilinx’s accounting policies to
determine if differences in accounting policies require further reclassification of Xilinx’s results of operations
or reclassification of assets or liabilities to conform to AMD’s accounting policies and classifications. As a
result, AMD may identify additional differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that,
when conformed, could have a material impact on these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements.

Note 5-Preliminary Merger Consideration and Allocation
Preliminary Merger Consideration
The preliminary merger consideration is approximately $39,321 million, based on the closing price of AMD
common stock on the Nasdaq of $92.35 on February 10, 2021. The aggregate value of the merger consideration
will fluctuate based upon changes in the price of AMD common stock and the number of shares of Xilinx
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, including shares subject to Xilinx restricted
stock awards outstanding on the closing date. The preliminary merger consideration is as follows:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
$1.1 billion represents the estimated fair value of Xilinx RSUs that will be assumed by AMD upon
completion of the merger. $847 million represents the estimated fair value of Xilinx RSUs to be expensed
over the future service period. The final value of Xilinx RSUs will be impacted by changes in the price of
AMD common stock and the number of Xilinx RSUs vested at the actual date of the closing of the merger.
The cash consideration for any fractional shares of AMD common stock that may become payable in respect
of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time has not been estimated
nor included in the purchase price presented for pro forma purposes.
The final merger consideration could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements primarily due to movements in the price of AMD common
stock and the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time on
the closing date of the merger. A 25% fluctuation in the market price of AMD common stock would affect the
value of the preliminary merger consideration reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information with a corresponding change to goodwill related to the transaction, as illustrated in the

Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Xilinx
are recorded at their fair values as of the merger date and added to those of AMD. The purchase price
allocation shown below is preliminary and based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and has been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the merger. For the
preliminary estimate of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Xilinx, AMD used certain
assumptions based on publicly available transaction data for the industry. The final purchase price allocation
is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have yet to be completed. Accordingly, the
preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to further adjustment as additional information becomes
available and as additional analyses and final valuations are completed, and such differences could have a
material impact on the final purchase price allocation.

Goodwill
$26,276
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of the underlying net assets
acquired. In accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but
instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any indicators of impairment. Goodwill is
attributable to the assembled workforce of Xilinx, planned growth in new markets and synergies expected to be
achieved from the combined operations of AMD and Xilinx. Goodwill recorded in the merger is not expected to
be deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value adjustments as shown above are further described below in Notes 6 and 7.
Other Long-term Liabilities
The adjustment to Other long-term liabilities relates to deferred tax liabilities, which will be recorded at the
effective date of the merger and which principally represent the deferred tax impact associated with the
incremental differences in book and tax basis of acquired intangible assets. Deferred taxes associated with
estimated fair value adjustments are computed using an estimated blended statutory U.S. federal and state tax
rate and statutory Singapore foreign tax rate. For balance sheet purposes, where U.S. tax rates were used, rates
were based on recently enacted U.S. tax law, and for statement of operations purposes, where U.S. tax rates
were used, rates were based on the tax laws applicable to the respective periods. The effective tax rate of the
combined company could be significantly different (either higher or lower) depending on post-merger
activities, including post-acquisition activities, cash needs, the geographical mix of income and changes in tax
law. This determination is preliminary and subject to change based upon the final determination of the fair
value of the identifiable intangible assets and liabilities.

The fair value estimate for all identifiable intangible assets is preliminary and is based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e.,
its highest and best use). The final fair value determination for identifiable intangible assets may differ
materially from this preliminary determination.
The amortization related to the identifiable intangible assets is reflected as a pro forma adjustment in the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations based on the estimated useful lives above.

The net adjustment to Other long-term liabilities of $1.3 billion reflects an increase in deferred tax liabilities of
$2.6 billion associated with acquired intangible assets that are not expected to be tax-deductible. AMD has
computed deferred tax impacts assuming Xilinx as a member of the combined company’s U.S. consolidated tax
return following the acquisition. The final determination of the treatment of AMD and Xilinx associated with
the U.S. tax filings may differ as a result of subsequent changes in tax laws and integration activities. The
acquired intangible assets resulted in a net deferred tax liability position for the combined company. Therefore,
the deferred tax assets have been reclassified to reflect a net deferred tax liability.
(b) Represents adjustments to the combined company accrued liabilities balance for (i) Xilinx retention
bonuses and (ii) AMD and Xilinx transaction costs anticipated to be paid in connection with completing the
merger. An adjustment for total additional retention bonuses of $41 million for Xilinx employees reflects the
full expected payable amount assuming all eligible employees remain employed through the applicable payout
dates. Total additional transaction costs of $138 million are expected, of which $126 million would be paid in
cash and which is reflected as an increase to accrued liabilities, with the remaining $12 million, which is
payable either in AMD common stock or cash, assumed to be paid in AMD common stock and reflected as an
increase in additional paid-in capital. Also see Note 6(d). Accrued liabilities do not include (i) transaction
costs of $20 million payable at closing solely at the discretion of AMD and (ii) transaction costs of up to $40
million that are payable based upon the value of Xilinx shares at closing.

The preliminary estimates of fair value and estimated useful lives will likely differ from final amounts that AMD
will calculate after completing a detailed valuation analysis and difference could have a material effect on the
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. A 10% increase in the
valuation of intangible assets would cause a corresponding increase in the amortization expense of
approximately $180 million for the year ended December 26, 2020. A 10% decrease in the valuation of intangible
assets would cause a corresponding decrease in the amortization expense of approximately $180 million for the

XILINX INC_20210305_DEFM14A_19107214_4148221.Pdf,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF AMD,"CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF AMD
Set forth below is information concerning corporate governance of AMD. The definitive proxy statement for
AMD’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders may include additional information related to the topics
discussed below. As used in this section, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to AMD, the term “Board”
refers to the AMD board of directors, and references to committees refer to the applicable committees of the
Board.
The Board has adopted the Governance Principles to address significant corporate governance matters. The
Governance Principles provide a framework for our corporate governance matters and include topics such as
Board and Board committee composition and evaluation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee is responsible for reviewing the Governance Principles and recommending any changes to the
Governance Principles to the Board.
Independence of Directors
The Governance Principles provide that a substantial majority of the members of the Board must meet the
criteria for independence as required by applicable law and the listing rules of Nasdaq. Among other criteria,
no director qualifies as independent unless the Board determines that the director has no direct material
relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in
carrying out the responsibilities of a director. On an annual basis, the Board undertakes a review of director
independence. The Board determined that all directors who served during fiscal 2020, other than Dr. Su, are
independent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules.
In making its independence determinations, the Board reviewed direct and indirect transactions and
relationships between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family, and us or one of our
subsidiaries or affiliates based on information provided by the director, our records and publicly available
information. All of the reviewed transactions and arrangements were entered into in the ordinary course of
business and none of the transactions or arrangements involved an amount that (i) exceeded the greater of 5%
of the recipient entity’s revenues or $200,000 with respect to transactions where a director or any member of
his or her immediate family or spouse served in any capacity other than as a director of a publicly held
corporation or (ii) exceeded $10,000 with respect to professional or consulting services provided by entities at
which our directors serve as professors or employees.
The Board determined that none of our directors currently has or has had any direct or indirect material
interest in any transactions and arrangements that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment
as members of the Board. The Board also determined that each of the members of the Audit and Finance
Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Leadership
Resources Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) are independent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq
rules.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During fiscal 2020, Ms. Denzel and Messrs. Durcan and Talwalkar served on the Compensation Committee.
None of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has been an executive officer or employee of AMD.
In addition, none of our executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a
company which has an executive officer who serves on the Board or the Compensation Committee.
Board Leadership Structure
The Governance Principles permit the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to be filled
by the same or different individuals, based on our needs, best practices and the interests of our stockholders.
This allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be combined or separated based
upon our
204 • 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
needs and the Board’s assessment of its leadership from time to time. The Board has the experience of
functioning effectively either way. The Board believes that its current leadership structure, with an
independent Chairman of the Board, separate from the Chief Executive Officer, is the most appropriate
leadership structure for the Company at this time, is in the best interests of the stockholders and allows the
Board to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently based on our current needs. Mr. Caldwell, who is
independent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules, is our Chairman of the Board. Mr. Caldwell presides at
meetings of our stockholders and directors and leads the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. The Board
benefits from Mr. Caldwell’s extensive and diversified leadership experience, financial management and risk
assessment experience. He also has strong public company board experience and has intimate familiarity with
our history and business.
Separating the roles of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer also enables the independent
directors to more meaningfully participate in the leadership of the Board. The Board currently believes this
structure provides an appropriate degree of oversight and allows Dr. Su, our President and Chief Executive
Officer, to focus on our business strategy and market opportunities, as well as on our organizational structure
and execution capabilities.
Risk Oversight
The Board’s role in risk oversight is consistent with our leadership structure, with our Chief Executive Officer
and other members of management having responsibility for day-to-day risk management activities and
processes, and the Board and its committees being actively involved in overseeing our risk management. The
Board and management consider “risk” for these purposes to be the possibility of an undesired occurrence
that could threaten the viability of the company, result in a material destruction of our assets or stockholder
value, or materially impact our long-term performance. Examples of the types of risks faced by us include:
business-specific risks related to our ability to develop new products and services, our strategic
position in key existing and new markets, our operational execution and infrastructure, our
relationships with our third-party manufacturing suppliers and competition in the microprocessor and
graphics markets;
macroeconomic risks, such as adverse global economic conditions and global geo-political events;
and
“event” risks, such as pandemics, natural disasters and cybersecurity threats.
During 2020, the Board and its committees also discussed with management strategies to address the impact
of COVID-19 on employees and our business operations and practices, including taking measures to protect
the health and safety of our employees and monitoring demand signals to assess supply chain requirements
and product schedules and roadmaps.
We engage in value-creating strategies and activities that appropriately balances returns with risk. We
mitigate potential exposures through our proactive risk management systems. Our senior management
participates in the identification and assessment of the inherent risks that impact our business and develops
processes and controls and other measures designed to mitigate those risks. Our Chief Executive Officer has
ultimate responsibility for management of our business, including enterprise level risks and the risk
management program and processes.
In fulfilling its oversight role, the Board focuses on understanding the nature of our enterprise risks, including
risks in our operations, finance and strategy, organization, compliance and external exposures as well as the
adequacy of our risk assessment and risk management processes. The Board has implemented a risk oversight
model that delegates certain risks to its committees and retains other risks at the Board-level. The Board and
committees periodically receive reports and updates from management. At least annually, the Board discusses
with management the appropriate level of risk relative to our strategy and objectives and reviews with
management our existing risk management processes and their effectiveness. The Board also receives periodic
205 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
management updates on our operations, organization, financial position and results and strategy and, as
appropriate, discusses and provides feedback with respect to risks related to these topics. In addition, the
Board receives full reports from the following Board committee chairs regarding each committee’s
considerations and actions related to the specific risk topics over which the committee has oversight:
The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board in overseeing our enterprise risk management
process, including the company’s financial and information technology (including product security
and cybersecurity) risk exposures; reviews our portfolio of risk; discusses with management
significant financial, reporting, regulatory and legal compliance risks in conjunction with enterprise
risk exposures as well as risks associated with our capital structure; reviews our policies with respect
to risk assessment and risk management and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or
control financial and enterprise risk exposure; business continuity; and emerging risks. The Audit and
Finance Committee meets with members of our Internal Audit department to discuss any issues that
warrant attention.
The Compensation Committee oversees risk management as it relates to our compensation policies
and practices as well as talent management and development applicable to all employees. It reviews
with management whether our compensation programs may create incentives for our employees to
take excessive or inappropriate risks which could be reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on us. For additional details, see “Compensation Policies and Practices.” Additionally, the
Compensation Committee oversees organizational risks, including leadership succession, talent
capacity, capabilities, attraction, retention and culture.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers potential risks related to the
effectiveness of the Board, including succession planning for the Board, our overall governance and
Board structure and matters related to environmental and social issues.
The Innovation and Technology Committee assists the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating
to technical and market risks associated with product development and investment, sourcing strategy,
as well as risk mitigation policies and procedures relating to products based on new technology or
significant innovations to existing technology.
Code of Ethics
The Board has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all directors and employees entitled the “Worldwide
Standards of Business Conduct,” which is designed to help directors and employees resolve ethical issues
encountered in the business environment. The Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct covers topics such
as conflicts of interest, compliance with laws (including anti-corruption laws), fair dealing, protecting our
property and confidentiality of our information and encourages the reporting of any behavior not in
accordance with the Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct.
The Board has also adopted a “Code of Ethics” for our executive officers and all other senior finance
executives. The Code of Ethics covers topics such as financial reporting, conflicts of interest and compliance
with laws, rules, regulations and our policies.

Board Meetings and Attendance
The Board held 15 meetings during 2020 and all members of the Board attended at least 75% of the meetings of
the Board and Board committees on which they served. In addition, on at least an annual basis, the Board and
management discuss our strategic direction, new business opportunities and product roadmap. Independent
and non-management directors also meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions without our Chief
Executive Officer and other members of senior management. In addition to these formal meetings, members of
the Board informally interact with senior management (including our Chief Executive Officer), industry leaders
and customers on a periodic basis. In 2020, sessions of only our non-employee directors were held five times.
Board Committees
The Board has four standing committees: an Audit and Finance Committee, a Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee, a Compensation Committee and an Innovation and Technology Committee. The
members of the Board committees and their Chairs are nominated by the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee and appointed by the Board.
Each of the Board committees has adopted a written charter, which has been approved by the Board. You can
access our current bylaws, committee charters, the Governance Principles, the Worldwide Standards of
Business Conduct and the Code of Ethics on the Investor Relations pages of our website at www.amd.com or
ir.amd.com.
Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board with its oversight
responsibilities regarding the integrity of our financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements, risk assessment, the performance of our internal audit function, our financial affairs and policies
and the nature and structure of major financial commitments. The Audit and Finance Committee is also directly
responsible for the appointment, independence, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of our
207 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
independent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Audit and Finance Committee.
The Audit and Finance Committee meets alone with our senior management, our financial, legal and internal
audit personnel and with our independent registered public accounting firm, which has free access to the
Audit and Finance Committee. The head of our Internal Audit Department reports directly to the Chair of the
Audit and Finance Committee and “dotted-line” to our Chief Financial Officer and serves a staff function for
the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee currently consists of Mr. Householder,
as Chair, and Messrs. Caldwell, Gregoire and Marren, each determined to be financially literate and
“independent” under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules. The Board also determined that Mr. Householder is an
“audit committee financial expert,” as defined under applicable SEC rules. The Audit and Finance Committee
held nine meetings during 2020.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
assists the Board in its responsibilities regarding the identification of qualified candidates to become Board
members, the selection of nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or
special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected), the selection of candidates to fill any
vacancies on the Board and the development and recommendation to the Board of corporate governance
guidelines and principles, including the Governance Principles, as well as matters related to environmental and
social issues (“ESG”), practices and reporting. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee oversees the Board’s annual review of its performance (including its composition and organization)
and leads a process for our non-employee directors to evaluate the performance of our Chief Executive Officer.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee retains a search firm for the purpose of obtaining
information regarding potential candidates for Board membership. The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee currently consists of Mr. Caldwell, as Chair, Ms. Denzel and Messrs. Durcan, Gregoire,
Householder, Marren and Talwalkar, each determined by the Board to be “independent” under applicable SEC
and Nasdaq rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held four meetings during 2020.
In evaluating candidates to determine if they are qualified to become Board members, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee looks principally for the following attributes: personal and professional
character, integrity, ethics and values; diversity and inclusion; general business experience and leadership
profile, including experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a
publicly held company; strategic planning abilities and experience; aptitude in accounting and finance;
expertise in domestic and international markets; experience in our industry and with relevant social policy
concerns; understanding of relevant technologies; expertise in an area of our operations; communication and
interpersonal skills; and practical and mature business judgment. The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee also considers Board members’ and nominees’ service on the boards of other public companies.
Although we do not have a formal diversity policy, to foster and maintain a diversity of viewpoints,
backgrounds and experience on the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates
the mix of skills and experience of the directors and assesses nominees and potential candidates in the context
of the current composition of the Board and our requirements, taking into consideration the diverse
communities and geographies in which we operate. Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee uses these and other criteria to evaluate potential nominees, there are no stated minimum criteria
for nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses the same standards to evaluate all
director candidates, regardless of who proposes them.
Compensation and Leadership Resources Committee. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in its
responsibilities relating to the compensation of all Section 16 officers, members of the Board and such other
employees as delegated from time to time by the Board. In consultation with management, the Board and the
Compensation Committee’s compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee designs, recommends to
the Board for approval and evaluates our compensation plans, policies and programs. In addition, the
Compensation Committee provides guidance on our talent management and development programs, including
but not limited to those regarding talent acquisition, retention, talent development, succession planning,
career progression, culture, diversity and inclusion. With respect to our Section 16 officers, the Compensation
Committee reviews and approves all grants to the Board, our executive officers, senior vice presidents, and
Section 16 officers under our
208

TABLE OF CONTENTS
equity plans. To the extent permitted by its charter, the Compensation Committee may delegate certain
authority and certain responsibilities to one or more of its members, our officers or a subcommittee of the
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee aims to structure our compensation program to
encourage high performance, promote accountability and align employee interests with our strategic goals and
with the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee also oversees risk management as it
relates to our compensation policies and practices for employees generally.
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist it in carrying out its
responsibilities. During 2020, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc. (“Compensia”), a national
compensation consulting firm, as its independent compensation consultant to provide assistance on executive
and director compensation matters. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on a variety of
compensation-related matters in 2020, including:
the competitiveness of our executive compensation program by providing market review of executive
compensation, evaluating our compensation peer group composition and compensation at our

Determining Non-Employee Director Compensation. The Compensation Committee annually reviews our non-
employee directors’ compensation. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee recommends any
changes to our non-employee directors’ compensation to the Board for approval. In addition, the Board and
Compensation Committee periodically evaluate how our director pay levels and pay policies compare to the
competitive market. In 2020, the Board and Compensation Committee reviewed competitive market data
regarding non-employee directors’ pay relative to our peer group (as described in more detail in
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis”) as well as the broader market which was compiled by Compensia,
the independent compensation consultant of our Compensation Committee. While competitive market data is
important to the evaluation of the directors’ compensation, such data is just one of several factors considered
by the Board in approving director compensation, and the Board has discretion in determining the nature and
extent of its use. In 2020, in addition to the competitive market data, the Board considered the amount of time
associated with Board and Board committee services as well as annual share usage under our 2004 Equity
Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “2004 Plan”) related to non-employee director compensation.
The Board continued the practice adopted in May 2014, to reallocate the mix of cash and equity compensation
paid to our non-employee directors, with the goal of maintaining total average compensation per non-
employee director at approximately the same level as had been previously paid and maintaining an affordable
annual share usage. These changes are further described under “Cash Fees Paid to Non-Employee Directors”
and “Equity Awards for Non-Employee Directors” below.
Cash Fees Paid to Non-Employee Directors. The cash fees our non-employee directors were eligible to
receive in fiscal 2020 was composed of the following elements:
Annual retainer for services as a director;
Annual retainer for services on a Board committee; and
Annual retainer for services as a Board committee chair.
Annual Retainer for Service as Director.Non-employee directors are paid an annual retainer for their service as
directors. In 2020, other than our Chairman of the Board, the non-employee directors were paid an annual
retainer of $75,000. The annual retainer for the Chairman of the Board for a full year of service is 1.5 times the
amount of the other Board members annual retainer, or $112,500.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Equity Awards for Non-Employee Directors. In order to align the long-term interests of our directors with
those of our stockholders, a portion of director compensation is provided in the form of equity. Non-employee
directors participate in the 2004 Plan and are entitled to receive equity awards under our Outside Director
Equity Compensation Policy, subject to the terms of the 2004 Plan. Non-employee directors are generally
eligible to receive an annual RSU award (an “Annual RSU Award”) upon re-election at each annual meeting of
stockholders, and, if a non-employee director is appointed to the Board on a date other than the date of an
annual meeting of stockholders, such director is entitled to receive an initial RSU award on his or her
appointment to the Board (an “Off-Cycle RSU Grant”).
Annual RSU Awards. Under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, which was amended in
February 2020, the Annual RSU Award for each non-employee director (other than the Chairman of the Board)
who has served on the Board continuously prior to an annual meeting of stockholders is calculated based on
the following formula, with no discretionary component: the quotient of (i) $205,000 (the “Target Equity
Value”) divided by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-trading day period preceding
and ending with the date of the respective RSU grant. The Chairman of the Board’s Annual RSU Award is 1.5x
the Target Equity Value.
In addition, under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, if a non-employee director has
served on the Board for less than twelve months prior to an annual meeting of stockholders, such director’s
Annual RSU Award is pro-rated based on the number of months of service before the respective annual
meeting of stockholders. For purposes of the pro rata calculation, service during any portion of a month
counts as a full month of service.
Off-Cycle Grants. Under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, an Off-Cycle Grant is equal
to the quotient of (i) the Target Equity Value divided by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for
the 30-trading day period preceding and ending with the date of the respective RSU grant. The Annual RSU
Awards and the Off-Cycle RSU Grants vest on the one-year anniversary of their grant dates.
In 2020, each of our directors received an Annual RSU Award under our current Outside Director Equity
Compensation Policy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Deferral. Pursuant to our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, our non-employee directors may elect
to defer the issuance of shares of our common stock that become issuable upon vesting of the RSUs granted
pursuant to the 2004 Plan (and the recognition of taxable income associated with such RSUs) until such time
as the director ceases to serve on the Board. A non-employee director can make this election by completing a
Restricted Stock Unit Award Deferral Election Agreement before the scheduled date of an RSU grant. If a
director makes this election, the issuance of the common stock subject to the RSUs may not be accelerated or
changed once the Election Agreement is submitted to us. Any common stock deferred under our Outside
Director Equity Compensation Policy is issued to the director, in one lump sum, within 30 days after his or her
resignation from the Board.
Acceleration of Vesting. Pursuant to our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, in the event of our
change of control, all of our non-employee directors’ equity compensation awards will become fully vested. In
addition, in the event of the termination of a non-employee director’s service to the Board as a result of death,
disability or retirement, all of his or her equity compensation awards will become fully vested; provided that,
such non-employee director served as a member of the Board for at least three years prior to the date of
termination and satisfied our stock ownership guideline requirements during his or her service as a Board
member.
Other Benefits for Non-Employee Directors. We reimburse our directors for their travel and expenses in
connection with attending Board meetings and Board-related activities, such as AMD site visits and
sponsored events, as well as for continuing education programs.
Stock Ownership Guidelines. Under our stock ownership guidelines, which were updated in August 2020, our
non-employee directors are required to hold the lesser of (i) the number of shares equivalent to five times their
then-current annual retainer divided by the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-day period
immediately preceding and ending with the date of the annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) 30,000 shares (in
the case of non-employee directors other than the Chairman of the Board) or 45,000 shares (in the case of the
Chairman of the Board).
The stock ownership guidelines must be achieved by each non-employee director within the later of (i) August
2022 or (ii) the five-year anniversary of the respective director’s first election or appointment to the Board or
first appointment as Chairman of the Board, as applicable.
Until the requirements of our stock ownership guidelines are achieved, each non-employee director is
encouraged to retain at least 10% of the “net shares”  (as defined below) obtained through our stock incentive
plans. Shares counted toward the minimum stock ownership requirements include (i) shares of common stock
owned outright by a director and his or her immediate family members who share the same household, whether
held individually or jointly; (ii) restricted stock where the restrictions have lapsed; (iii) shares acquired upon
stock option exercise; (iv) shares purchased in the open market; (v) restricted stock units where the
restrictions have lapsed but the issuance of the shares to the director has been deferred at the election of the
director pursuant to a Company policy, plan or written agreement; and (vi) shares held in trust. “Net shares”
are the number of shares from the sale of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock
units, less the number of shares the director sells to cover the exercise price of stock options and sells to pay
taxes.
As of December 26, 2020, all of our non-employee directors were holding the required number of shares under
our stock ownership guidelines or had time remaining to do so within the established compliance time frame.

Executive Summary
2020 Business Highlights
2020 marked an inflection point in our long-term journey as we made significant progress establishing AMD as
the high-performance computing leader, while setting a new record for annual revenue. We significantly
accelerated our business and exceeded our aggressive growth goals for the year while navigating industry-
wide challenges caused by COVID-19. We built substantial momentum throughout the year as we successfully
ramped volume production of more than twenty 7nm PC, gaming, and data center products.
We made great progress across our businesses in 2020 as we gained market share with our 7nm Ryzen
 and
EPYC
 processors. For the year, record annual client processor revenue grew by more than 50% as AMD
Ryzen processor demand increased. Adoption of EPYC processors across cloud, enterprise and HPC
customers also accelerated significantly in 2020. We set a new all-time record for annual server processor
revenue. Server processor sales more than doubled year-over-year, and our overall data center sales are now a
high teens percentage of our total annual revenue. Strong demand for our 7nm products powered by our “Zen
3” processor core increased AMD’ momentum across the PC, Gaming and data center markets
Our financial results in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 were strong as we delivered record annual revenue,
higher gross margins, and a significant growth in profitability. In 2020, we grew revenue by 45% year-over-
year to $9.76 billion and increased our gross margin to 45% compared to 43% in the prior year, which marked
our highest gross margin since 2011. We increased our operating income to $1.37 billion compared to $631
million for fiscal 2019 and improved our net income to $2.49 billion, including a $1.30 billion income tax benefit

associated with a valuation allowance release, compared to $341 million in the prior year. We also made
significant progress strengthening our balance sheet as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments totaled $2.29 billion, up from $1.50 billion in the prior year.
Driven by superior operational and financial performance, we were the seventh highest performing stock in the
S&P 500 with annual growth of 100%, following growth of 143% in 2019 and 80% in 2018. From the end of
fiscal 2015 to the end of fiscal 2020, our market capitalization appreciated, generating approximately $109
billion in value for our stockholders. The following graphic compares the change in our market capitalization
to the change in the S&P 500 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (“SOX”) from the end of fiscal
2015 through the end of fiscal 2020:
2020 Executive Compensation Program - Highlights
We operate in a challenging, highly competitive and rapidly evolving global business environment. To
compete effectively in this environment, our Compensation Committee has implemented an executive
compensation program that is designed to: emphasize “pay for performance”; advance our business strategies
and objectives; drive the creation of long-term sustainable stockholder value; and attract, retain and motivate
high-caliber senior leadership. Accordingly, our 2020 executive compensation program:
Provides our Named Executive Officers with target total direct compensation that is competitive with
the market;
Rewards our Named Executive Officers for superior financial and operational results through our
Executive Incentive Plan (our “EIP”), a short-term cash incentive program that puts a substantial
component of pay at risk, with payouts tied to achievement of carefully selected and calibrated
financial performance objectives and strategic milestones; and
Aligns our Named Executive Officers’ interests with those of our stockholders through long-term
equity-based awards, including performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) tied to above-
market stock price performance.
Consistent with the forgoing, the compensation payable to our Named Executive Officers for 2020 was
primarily driven by achievement of the financial performance objectives and strategic milestones under our EIP
and our stock price performance.
2020 Executive Compensation Program - Emphasis on “Pay for Performance”
As the tables below illustrate, the target total direct compensation (defined below) delivered to our Named
Executive Officers in 2020 was weighted heavily towards performance-based compensation:
Approximately 94% of our Chief Executive Officer’s target total direct compensation and
approximately 86% of the average target total direct compensation of our other Named Executive
Officers was delivered in the form of variable or “at risk” compensation tied to Company, individual,
or stock price performance;
215 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Long-term equity awards (the ultimate value of which depend on our stock price) continued to be the
largest element of compensation, representing approximately 83% of our Chief Executive Officer’s
target total direct compensation and approximately 72% of the average target total direct
compensation of our other Named Executive Officers; and
100% of the target annual incentive bonuses payable to our Named Executive Officers was tied to the
achievement of pre-established financial goals for the 2020 fiscal year that align with our annual
operating plan and strategic milestones.
As used herein, a Named Executive Officer’s “target total direct compensation” is the sum of his or her base
salary, target annual incentive bonus opportunity under our EIP and the aggregate intended target value of
long- term equity awards granted under our 2004 Plan in the 2020 fiscal year. The aggregate intended target
values of our long-term equity awards, excluding the non-recurring retention equity award for Mr. Grasby (see
“Retention Equity Award - Darren Grasby” below), differ from the accounting values (grant date fair value)
that are included in the “2020 Summary Compensation Table” and “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2020” table
below.
2020 Realized Pay Driven by Financial and Operational Results and Stock Price Performance
The total compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as reported in the 2020 Summary Compensation
Table, reflects the accounting values (grant date fair value) of their annual long-term equity awards and not
the economic value actually realized by our Named Executive Officers from these awards. Since a significant
portion of the reported compensation of our Named Executive Officers represents potential future
compensation, we believe it is useful to supplement the information provided in the 2020 Summary
Compensation Table with a discussion of the pay our Named Executive Officers actually realized during the
fiscal year.
The table below compares our market capitalization to the “realized pay” of our Chief Executive Officer and the
average “realized pay” of our other Named Executive Officers for each of our last three fiscal years. As this
table demonstrates, the compensation collectively “realized” by our Named Executive Officers in the aggregate
from
216

(3) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the end of fiscal 2018 to the end of fiscal 2020 represented 0.28% of the $101.2 billion in value created for our
stockholders during that same period.
Each Named Executive Officer’s “realized pay” is the sum of his or her earned base salary, actual annual
incentive bonus under the EIP, any discretionary or retention bonus amounts realized, other
compensation, and Form W-2 income realized due to stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted
stock unit and performance-based awards under our equity plans for the applicable fiscal year. Additional
information is provided below in the “2020 Summary Compensation Table” and the “Option Exercises and
Stock Vested in 2020” table. Realized pay is not a substitute for total compensation. For more information
on total compensation as calculated under SEC rules, see the notes accompanying the 2020 Summary
Compensation Table below.
The fiscal 2018 average of the Other Named Executive Officers exclude Messrs. Bergman and Grasby, who
were not Named Executive Officers during those years. The fiscal 2019 average of the Other Named
Executive Officers excludes Mr. Bergman, who joined us on August 5, 2019.
The AMD Market Capitalization amounts are as of the last day of each applicable fiscal year.
The realized pay of our Named Executive Officers in 2020 was primarily attributable to (i) the growth in AMD
stock price and the vesting of long-term equity awards and exercise of stock options that were granted in prior
years, (ii) payout vs. target amounts for PRSUs and (iii) their annual incentive bonuses under the EIP. The EIP
payout in 2020 was 142% of target compared to 74.6% of target in 2019 and 86% of target in 2018, resulting in
an average payout under the EIP for the previous three fiscal years of 100.9% of target. For a discussion of the
EIP, see “2020 Compensation Elements - Annual Incentive Bonuses” below.
Response to 2020 “Say On Pay” Vote and Stockholder Engagement Process
The Compensation Committee seeks to align the objectives of our executive compensation program with the
interests of our stockholders. When evaluating our executive compensation program, the Compensation
Committee carefully considers both the results of our annual advisory resolution on the compensation of our
Named Executive Officers (the “say on pay” proposal) as well as direct feedback from our stockholders, with
whom we actively and directly engage throughout the fiscal year. After three years of consistently strong
(90%+) stockholder support, our “say on pay” resolution received 66.9% (70.2% as calculated by Institutional
Shareholder Services) support at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. We believe this was primarily due
to the multi-year PRSU awards granted to Dr. Su and Mr. Papermaster in 2019 (the “Value Creation Equity
Awards”), which were intended to be one-time awards. However, as a result, during 2020 we further intensified
our stockholder engagement regarding executive compensation and other corporate governance matters.
Our relationship with our stockholders is an important part of our company’s success and we have a long
tradition of engaging with our stockholders and obtaining their perspectives. During 2020, our integrated
outreach team led by our Investor Relations group and executive compensation team, met to discuss a wide
variety of issues with investors. We believe that our approach to engaging openly with our investors on
topics such as financial issues, corporate governance, diversity and inclusion, executive compensation, and
corporate
217

TABLE OF CONTENTS
responsibility drives increased corporate accountability, improves decision-making, and ultimately creates
long- term value. We are committed to:
Accountability. Maintain leading corporate governance practices to ensure good oversight,
accountability, and good decision-making.
Engagement. Proactively engage with stockholders and stakeholder groups in dialogue on a range of
topics to solicit feedback and identify emerging trends and issues to inform our thinking and
approach.
Transparency. Maintain high levels of transparency on a range of financial and environmental, social
and governance (ESG) matters to build trust and sustain two-way stakeholder dialogue that supports
our business strategy and success.
In addition to our regular engagements, we held a series of meetings every year with many of our institutional
stockholders focused on compensation practices, COVID-19, environmental, social and governance
disclosures and diversity and inclusion, among other topics. We pursue multiple avenues for stockholder
engagement, including in-person and virtual meetings with our stockholders, participating at various
conferences (including virtual engagement in 2020), and issuing periodic reports on our activities. Through
these activities, we discuss and receive input, provide additional information, and address questions on our
corporate strategy, executive compensation programs, corporate governance, and other topics of interest to
our stockholders, such as our corporate responsibility activities discussed above. These engagement efforts
with our stockholders allow us to better understand our stockholders’ priorities and perspectives, and provide
us with useful input concerning our corporate strategy and our compensation and ESG practices. We actively
engage with our stockholders on a year-round basis and remain active outside of proxy season. Feedback
from these engagements is provided to the Board who in turn decides whether enhancements to our
company’s policies and practices are required to meet stockholder expectations relating to current or new
issues or emerging trends.
In 2020, we engaged with over 60% of our total shares outstanding and our Directors personally engaged
with nearly 30% of our total shares outstanding.
Stockholder Engagement Feedback
In summary, stockholder feedback centered on the following themes:
Board Composition
We provide substantial disclosure around the composition of our current Board and the skill sets we
consider important for our directors to have as well as our process for identifying and evaluating
potential director candidates.
Annually, we look at and assess the composition of the Board across a broad range of criteria
including, but not limited to industry and geographic experience, skills, education, and diversity.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Disclosures
The Board maintains formal oversight responsibility for our focus on corporate responsibility. Our
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is primarily responsible for these matters with
additional ESG matters reviewed by other committees (e.g., the Compensation Committee is
responsible for oversight of human capital issues and the Audit Committee is responsible for
oversight of our corporate ethics and compliance program).
Based on stockholder feedback, this year we have disclosed more information about ESG.
Additionally, our 25  anniversary Corporate Citizenship Report published in 2020 highlighted our
progress across various sustainability metrics.
In 2020, we completed multi-year sustainability goals spanning energy efficiency in products,
greenhouse gas reductions in our operations, and “best-in-class” greenhouse gas, water and waste
management with our wafer foundry suppliers. For instance, we exceeded our award-winning AMD
25x20 energy Efficiency goal that demonstrated a 31.7x more typical-use, energy efficiency in our
processors for mobile devices since 2014 (more information is available at AMD.com/25x20).

We also surveyed and interviewed external and internal stakeholders to gather ESG feedback,
priorities, and opportunities that are of importance and material to the company and society. We are
currently assessing the feedback and expect to further develop our strategic ESG focus areas and
goals this year. We continue to be focused on strategic ESG issues such as product energy efficiency
and climate, human capital management, supply chain responsibility, and the role of technology in
society. We disclose hundreds of related data points in our ESG data tables and Global Reporting
Index (GRI), including environmental data on energy, emissions, water and waste; employee-related
data on gender, age, well-being and community; supplier responsibility data on assessments,
trainings and audits; and more.
Executive Compensation
In the aggregate, feedback received during these discussions continued to be supportive of our
executive compensation program and our compensation program design, and we received feedback
that AMD has a well-functioning incentive program which appropriately rewards strong long-term
performance.
Some stockholders expressed concern with the Value Creation Equity Awards granted to Dr. Su and
Mr. Papermaster. As we explained in our definitive proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting of
stockholders and reiterated in many of our conversations with our stockholders, the Value Creation
Equity Awards were intended to be one-time awards that the Compensation Committee and the non-
management members of the Board approved following their review and consideration of (i) Dr. Su’s
and Mr. Papermaster’s unique and significant contributions to our success (ii) our long-term
objectives and strategy, (iii) the potential incentive and retention value of Dr. Su’s and Mr.
Papermaster’s then- outstanding equity holdings, and (iv) the highly competitive marketplace for
executive talent. Under their leadership, AMD has performed exceptionally well from an operational,
financial and stockholder return perspective. Since Dr. Su’s promotion to Chief Executive Officer in
2014, AMD has created over $109 billion in market capitalization for our stockholders. The
Compensation Committee and non-management members of the Board determined the Value Creation
Equity Awards were in the best interests of AMD and its stockholders by promoting the retention and
further motivation of Dr. Su and Mr. Papermaster, whose continued focus and dedication is vitally
important to our continued growth and long-term success.
We shared stockholder feedback with the Compensation Committee, which considers both the results
of our say-on-pay vote as well as direct feedback from stockholders to align the objectives of our
executive compensation program with the interests of our stockholders. As we evaluated our
compensation practices for 2020, the Compensation Committee considered the strong support we
received from our stockholders for the overall design of our executive compensation program during
our 2020 engagement as well as in the past.
Based on stockholder feedback and considering the unique circumstances of our 2019 program, the
Compensation Committee decided to retain the overall program design, which they believe
emphasizes pay-for-performance and provides a competitive program that effectively retains and
motivates our Named Executive Officers while aligning with stockholder value creation. Based on
stockholder feedback, no Value Creation Equity Awards were granted in 2020.
Despite the challenging external landscape due to the COVID-19 pandemic that impacted our
business operations and practices as well as the global economy at large, the Compensation
Committee did not make any mid-year adjustments to the fiscal 2020 EIP performance targets.
Diversity and Inclusion
We shared our commitment to diversity and inclusion and outlined our vision for stockholders this
year. Our Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion (“DB&I”) vision is that: Transforming lives through high
performance computing is enabled by attracting, acquiring, developing, and advancing our aim to
have the most engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce in the semiconductor industry. Our goal is to
grow and expand our global team to include as many unique, underrepresented, and minority

TABLE OF CONTENTS
voices as possible to fuel our differentiated culture, enable great products and deliver strong
business results while also advocating for diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem.
We believe diversity, belonging and inclusion creates better companies and increases stockholder
returns.
Cultivating the best and brightest semiconductor talent across the globe strengthens our high-
performance culture and solidifies our place as an industry leader for years to come.
Our DB&I strategy is an extension of our existing talent strategy and winning culture, as younger
generations view purposeful DB&I action as a work culture imperative, not just a “nice to have.”
In line with stockholder feedback, we developed our 3-year diversity and inclusion strategy in 2020 to
set measurable goals to determine success in the coming years in primary focus areas of Women,
People of Color, Employee Community and professional development.
Based on stockholder feedback, we added a DB&I goal to our EIP strategic milestones for 2021.
Pandemic-Related Business Continuity
AMD worked diligently to navigate the uncertainty of COVID-19. We continuously monitored and
assessed the situation to take the necessary steps to maintain business continuity while protecting
the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. We remain committed to being a
strong and dependable partner.
AMD possesses a world-class global supply chain. Over the last five years we have established a
track record of excellence in execution and we are well-positioned today to continue to execute well
through these unprecedented times. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we made adjustments and
mitigated the impact on our global operations. We have stayed very close to our partners, customers
and employees to make sure we are doing all that we can to support the evolving environment and
their priorities.
We are proud that people are working safely and productively remotely on AMD-powered laptops,
using services running on AMD-powered servers, and searching for medical breakthroughs on AMD-
powered supercomputers. We don’t take this responsibility lightly.
We provided technology and home office stipends for employees as they eased into remote work and
provided PPE and testing globally. We continue to keep the health and safety of our employees, and
those of our partners, as the top priority. We are following guidelines from local government and
public health authorities around the world and implementing best practices to keep our operations
running effectively.
Stockholder feedback was that AMD’s actions and rapid and decisive response to COVID-19 was
world class and thorough.
Our commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability - built on a strong foundation of transparency,
governance, and ethics - creates value for AMD and our stockholders by helping us mitigate risks, reduce
costs, build brand value and identify new market opportunities. Through our technology, we enable others to
solve some of the world’s toughest problems - from climate change and energy efficiency, to medical
advancements and positive societal change. We are proud of the results we have achieved to date - but as we
look toward the next decade we know that even greater leadership will be required in the area of ESG.
A foundational element of our approach to corporate responsibility is our commitment to transparency, and we
regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our reporting on our ESG reporting continue to strive to keep pace with
reporting advancements in this area including in our most recent Corporate Responsibility Report.
The Board recommends that stockholders initiate communications with the Board, the Chairman, or any Board
committee by writing to our Corporate Secretary at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 2485 Augustine Drive,
Santa Clara, California 95054 or by email to Corporate.Secretary@amd.com. This process assists the Board in
reviewing and responding to stockholder communications. The Board has instructed our Corporate Secretary
to review correspondence directed to the Board and, at the Corporate Secretary’s discretion, to forward items
that seem to be appropriate for the Board’s consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Executive Compensation Policies and Practices
We implement sound executive compensation policies and practices, which we believe drive superior
performance and prohibit or minimize behaviors that we believe do not serve our stockholders’ long-term
interests, as highlighted in the below table:
Policy/Practice
Summary
Claw-back/Recovery Rights
We have the right to claw-back incentive-based and other compensation
(including equity awards) paid or granted to an employee (including any
Named Executive Officer) in the event of certain misconduct by the
employee.
One-year minimum vesting
period for equity awards
Our 2004 Plan requires a minimum one-year vesting period, subject to
limited exceptions such as death, disability, termination of employment or a
change in control of AMD.
Change in control payments are
“double- trigger” and capped
Our change in control agreements are “double-trigger,” meaning payments
will be made only if there is an involuntary termination of employment
without cause or constructive discharge following a change in control.
Further, since March 2010 we have not and will not enter into change in
control agreements that provide cash change in control payments that
exceed (i) two times the sum of base salary and target annual incentive
bonus plus (ii) the pro-rated target annual incentive bonus for the year in
which the termination of employment occurs.
No new excise tax gross- ups
Since April 2009, we have not and will not enter into any change in control
agreement or arrangement with a Named Executive Officer that provides for
an excise tax gross-up payment.
Limited perquisites
We provide limited perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named
Executive Officers and provide air and other travel for our Named Executive
Officers for business purposes only.
Anti-hedging and pledging policy
We prohibit our employees (including our Named Executive Officers and
Directors) from hedging AMD securities. Pledging of AMD securities is not
permitted without the preapproval of the Nominating and Governance
Committee, which is only granted in very limited circumstances. None of
our Named Executive Officers or Directors currently have pledged any
shares.
Incentive compensation amounts
are subject to payment thresholds
and maximums
Our annual cash performance bonuses and 2020 annual PRSU awards have
threshold performance requirements that must be achieved to receive
payment and are subject to maximum potential payment “caps.”
Stock ownership requirements
We have robust stock ownership requirements for our Chief Executive
Officer and other Named Executive Officers.
Compensation risk assessment
The Compensation Committee conducts an annual risk assessment of our
compensation policies and practices to ensure that our programs are not
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
Talent Management Focus
Developing, motivating, retaining, and attracting talent is critical to guide and execute our strategy as well as
to continue to grow our business. This is a strong focus of our executive compensation program and the
Compensation Committee. Our executive compensation program aligns with our talent objectives and our
221 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
compensation decisions not only consider individual and company performance, but also long-term potential,
key retention needs and organizational succession plans.
One of the Compensation Committee’s responsibilities described in its charter is to regularly review
succession planning and talent development. The Compensation Committee at least annually reviews
succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executive positions. These reviews occur
with input from the Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President, Worldwide Marketing, Human
Resources and Investor Relations and our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. The
Compensation Committee also reviews succession plans in executive session, with no members of
management present. Succession planning for key executive roles consists of an assessment of internal
candidates and their development plans, as well as potential external talent, while factoring in our culture and
an emphasis on diversity and inclusion.
We believe that building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and
increasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes AMD stronger. We are focused on hiring
and developing under-represented minorities and women leaders. We are proud to be led by a highly regarded
Chief Executive Officer who has earned many esteemed awards for her business and technical prowess. In
2020, Dr. Su received the semiconductor industry’s highest honor as the 2020 recipient of the Robert N. Noyce
Award. Dr. Su also ranked #2 on Fortune’s Businessperson of the Year list for her strategic vision and
successful company turnaround.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Pay for Performance
Our executive compensation program philosophy centers on pay for performance and is guided by the
following primary principles:
Principle
Description
Business Driven
Compensation should be aligned to performance. Rewards should be
directly tied to the achievement of specific financial, operational and
strategic objectives that generally lead to increased and sustained
stockholder value.
Performance Differentiated
Compensation should be structured to create an effective link between pay
and performance at both the company and individual level. With improved
company performance and increases in company valuation and stock price,
our compensation programs should deliver higher rewards to our Named
Executive Officers.
Market Competitive
Compensation should be competitive to attract, retain and motivate high-
caliber senior leadership.
Ownership Oriented
Compensation should be fully aligned with stockholder interests by
delivering meaningful equity awards tied to and balanced with stockholder
value creation and by maintaining robust stock ownership requirements.
We continually assess and adjust our executive compensation program, policies and practices taking into
account these guiding principles and based on feedback obtained through our stockholder engagement
efforts.
Competitive Compensation
We operate in a highly competitive business environment; therefore, it is imperative that we recruit and retain
top leadership and industry experts to guide and execute our business strategy. This requires that we offer
competitive compensation. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee seeks to compensate our Named
Executive Officers at competitive levels with compensation for executives in similar positions at a group of
peer companies (set forth below), which the Compensation Committee believes reflects the current competitive
market for executive talent. In making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee also considers
a
222 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
number of other factors, including the scope of responsibility of each Named Executive Officer, internal pay
comparisons and the retention value of each Named Executive Officer’s unvested long-term equity award
holdings, as well as its assessment of each Named Executive Officer’s performance and expected future
contributions and impact on the organization.
Generally, the Compensation Committee seeks to position each Named Executive Officer’s target total direct
compensation between the 50th and 75th percentile of the competitive market (the “Target Positioning”). A
Named Executive Officer’s target total direct compensation may vary from the Target Positioning depending
on the other factors. The compensation realized by a Named Executive Officer will reach the Target Positioning
only if applicable performance targets are achieved and our stock price matches index performance and does
not decline. However, if performance targets are exceeded and our Total Stockholder Return (TSR) surpasses
the benchmark index, then the compensation realized by the Named Executive Officer could be substantially
greater than the Target Positioning. For 2020, the actual total target direct compensation was generally
consistent with our Target Positioning and the realized compensation was higher because of Company and
stock price performance.
Align Pay Practices with Sound Risk Management
The Compensation Committee seeks to structure our executive compensation program to motivate and reward
our Named Executive Officers for appropriately balancing opportunity and risk, such as investment in key
initiatives designed to advance our growth in existing and new markets while at the same time avoiding pay
practices that encourage excessive risk-taking.
The Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program fosters our objectives while
mitigating potentially excessive risk-taking through the following means:
Sound Risk Management
✓
Compensation is an appropriate balance of “fixed” pay versus “variable” pay, as well as
“short-term” versus “long-term” incentives
✓
Performance-based compensation opportunities are capped
✓
Our annual incentive plans include multiple Company-wide financial measures that are
quantitative and measurable
✓
Long-term equity awards are a balanced mix of time-based and performance-based vesting,
both spanning multiple years
✓
Long-term equity awards generally have a minimum vesting period of one year
✓
Compensation is subject to recoupment (“claw-back”) policies and provisions
✓
Our Named Executive Officers are subject to stock ownership requirements
How We Make Compensation Decisions
Role of the Compensation Committee and the Board
The Compensation Committee is responsible to the Board for developing and overseeing our executive
compensation and benefits policies and programs. The Compensation Committee, which consists of three
independent directors, is responsible for reviewing our executive compensation program annually to evaluate
its alignment with the strategies and needs of our business, market trends and the interests of our
stockholders. The Compensation Committee is responsible for formulating compensation recommendations to
the nonmanagement members of the Board regarding our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation and for
approving the compensation of our other Named Executive Officers. This includes:
reviewing and approving the performance goals and objectives that relate to performance-based
compensation awarded under the EIP and the 2004 Plan;
conducting an annual compensation risk assessment to evaluate our compensation policies and
practices;
223 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
evaluating the competitiveness of each Named Executive Officer’s total compensation package; and
reviewing and approving any changes to a Named Executive Officer’s total compensation package,
such as base salary, annual incentive bonus opportunities, annual long-term incentive award
opportunities, and payouts and retention programs.
The Compensation Committee is supported by our Chief Executive Officer (other than with respect to her own
compensation) and other members of management. The Compensation Committee considers the input of these
individuals to formulate the specific plan and award designs, including performance measures and
performance levels, necessary to align our executive compensation program with our business objectives and
strategies. These individuals did not attend either executive sessions or portions of any meetings of the
Compensation Committee or the Board where their own compensation determinations were made.
The non-management members of the Board annually conduct a performance assessment of our Chief
Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee reviews and considers this performance assessment in making
its recommendations to the non-management members of the Board regarding the compensation and other
terms of our Chief Executive Officer’s employment. Our Chief Executive Officer does not participate in the
determination of her own compensation and no management recommendation is made regarding her
compensation.
Role of Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist in carrying out its
responsibilities. During 2020, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, a national compensation
consulting firm, as its compensation consultant to provide assistance on executive and director compensation
matters. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on a variety of compensation-related matters,
including:
the competitiveness of our executive compensation program by providing a market review of
executive compensation, evaluating our compensation peer group composition and analyzing the
compensation at our compensation peer group companies;
the pay levels of our Named Executive Officers by assessing and advising on equity and cash
compensation guidelines for various executive job levels and assessing compensation levels for our
executive officers;
our executive compensation program design, including short-term and long-term incentive plan
design and pay mix, the framework for our long-term equity awards and our retention strategies,
evaluation of our stock ownership guidelines, and assessment of severance and change of control
arrangements; and
the compensation arrangements for the non-management members of the Board.
Conflict of Interest Assessment for Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of receiving objective advice from its compensation
consultant and conducts an annual conflicts of interest assessment of its compensation consultant. In 2020,
Compensia did not provide any services to or receive any payments from us, except in its capacity as a
consultant to the Compensation Committee. In March 2020, the Compensation Committee considered whether
the services provided by Compensia raised any conflicts of interest pursuant to the rules of the SEC and the
listing rules of Nasdaq and concluded that the work performed by Compensia did not raise any conflicts of
interest. The Compensation Committee expects to update its consideration of this topic in March 2021, and its
conclusions will be included in our definitive proxy statement for our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders.
In the course of its engagement, Compensia attended meetings of the Compensation Committee and, where
applicable, presented its findings and recommendations for discussion. Compensia also consulted frequently
with members of the Compensation Committee and met with members of senior management to obtain and
validate market data, review materials, and discuss management’s compensation recommendations.
224 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Role of the Chief Executive Officer
Generally, during the Compensation Committee’s annual review of executive compensation, our Chief
Executive Officer reviews with the Compensation Committee her performance evaluations of each of our other
Named Executive Officers and her compensation recommendations for those Named Executive Officers. The
Compensation Committee considers these recommendations in its decision process.
Competitive Pay Analysis
Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews the compensation decisions of a custom group of peer
companies in combination with industry-specific compensation survey data to develop an understanding of
the “competitive market” with respect to current executive compensation levels and related policies and
practices. The Compensation Committee then evaluates how our pay practices and our Named Executive
Officers’ compensation levels compared to the competitive market. As part of this evaluation, the
Compensation Committee also reviews the performance measures and related performance target levels
generally used within the competitive market to reward performance. The Compensation Committee believes
that it appropriately sets the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, while taking into account the
practices of our peers and industry best practices.
Methodology Used to Perform the Competitive Pay Analysis
To assist the Compensation Committee in its review of the 2020 compensation for our Named Executive
Officers, Compensia provided a competitive pay analysis in February 2020, which set forth compensation data
developed from publicly available information (as of November 2019) of the companies included in a custom
peer group (the “2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group”). In May 2020, Compensia provided the
Compensation Committee an update to this competitive pay analysis that reflected, in relevant part, (a) AMD
and peer stock price and financial data as of April 17, 2020 and (b) the February 25, 2020 retention equity
award to Mr. Grasby.
To develop the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group, the Compensation Committee reviewed the group of
companies comprising the then-existing compensation peer group in November 2019, with particular reference
to their industry (i.e., business segment), revenues (generally 50% to 200% of our revenues for the trailing
four fiscal quarters) and market capitalization (generally 30% to 300% of our market capitalization), in each
case based on publicly available information as of November 4, 2019. The Compensation Committee selected
these two metrics because, based on Compensia’s analysis and holding all other factors constant, revenue has
the greatest correlation to cash compensation levels and market capitalization has the greatest influence on
equity compensation levels.
Based on this review, the Compensation Committee removed ON Semiconductor Corp. because its market
capitalization was less than 30% of our market capitalization, and Symantec Corporation because it was
undergoing major business changes and completed the sale of its enterprise security assets on November 4,
2019. Also based on this review, and in order to improve the statistical sampling of the peer group, the
Compensation Committee added Micron Technology, Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., each of which fit within the
applicable criteria for industry and market capitalization. Although Micron Technology, Inc. and Qualcomm
Inc. each have revenues that exceed 200% of our revenues for the trailing four fiscal quarters, the
Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to include them in our 2020 Executive Compensation
Peer Group given the limited alternatives. Our revenues for the trailing four fiscal quarters ending December
28, 2019, would have placed us in approximately the 38th percentile of the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer
Group based on publicly available information. The Compensation Committee believes that the composition of
the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group reflects an appropriate set of comparator companies for
purposes of assessing our executive compensation program.
The Compensation Committee used the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group competitive pay analysis
developed by Compensia as its reference source in analyzing the competitiveness of our Named Executive
Officers’ compensation. As compared to the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group, AMD’s fiscal 2020 and
fiscal 2019 annual revenue was approximately $9.76 billion and $6.73 billion, respectively.

exchange rate of 1.356 U.S. dollars per 1.00 British pound, which was the exchange rate reported by
Bloomberg Financial as of December 26, 2020.
Annual Cash Performance Bonuses
Generally, short-term incentives in the form of an annual cash performance bonus are provided to our Named
Executive Officers under the EIP. These bonuses are designed to reward short-term performance and the
achievement of the principal goals of our annual operating plan.
Under the fiscal 2020 EIP, the amount of each Named Executive Officer’s annual cash performance bonus was
calculated based on (i) his or her target annual cash performance bonus opportunity, (ii) our corporate
financial performance (weighted 80%) for fiscal 2020, as measured against pre-established performance levels
(the “Financial Performance Targets”) and (iii) achievement of strategic milestones (weighted 20%) established
with respect to new product tape outs, launches, and commercial/operational metrics (the “Strategic
Milestones”). The Financial Performance Targets and the Strategic Milestones were approved by the
Compensation Committee in February 2020. Notwithstanding achievement of the fiscal 2020 performance
goals, the Compensation Committee has discretion under the EIP to increase or to reduce any Named
Executive Officer’s annual cash performance bonus.
The following illustrates how the 2020 annual cash performance bonuses under the EIP were calculated:
Financial Performance Targets
The Compensation Committee used the following financial performance measures and weightings as the
Financial Performance Targets for the fiscal 2020 EIP:

management. The performance levels were structured to align with our fiscal 2020 financial objectives taking
into account overall affordability of the bonus opportunities provided under the EIP for fiscal 2020.
The Compensation Committee chose adjusted non-GAAP net income as a performance measure because it is a
fair measure of our profitability and a valid metric for comparison, which the Compensation Committee
believes is directly tied to enhanced stock price performance. The Compensation Committee assigned it a
weight of 50% because it is a key short-term financial measure for the operation of our business and is a
measure of significant importance to our stockholders. For purposes of the fiscal 2020 EIP, our “adjusted non-
GAAP net income” was calculated by adjusting our fiscal 2020 GAAP net income for (i) non-GAAP financial
adjustments such as a loss on debt redemption/conversion, non-cash interest expense related to convertible
debt, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, provision for income taxes associated with these
adjustments and release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and (ii) amounts accrued for fiscal 2020
annual cash performance bonuses.
The Compensation Committee chose revenue as a performance measure because it reflects our top-line
growth, which the Compensation Committee believes is a strong indicator of our long-term ability to increase
profitability, cash flow and improve stock price performance. For purposes of the fiscal 2020 EIP, we use our
GAAP net revenue for fiscal 2020.
Finally, the Compensation Committee chose adjusted free cash flow as a performance measure because it
believes effective cash management and cash generation are key components of our strategy and our annual
operating plan, the successful execution of which should lower indebtedness, increase financial flexibility and
ultimately drive improved company valuation and stock price performance. For purposes of the fiscal 2020 EIP,
our “adjusted free cash flow” was calculated by adjusting our GAAP net cash provided by operating activities
for (i) purchases of property and equipment and (ii) cash payments for fiscal 2019 bonuses which were paid in
March and April 2020.
The following table sets forth the 2020 performance levels and comparable actual results for the EIP:

The threshold, target and maximum performance levels for the fiscal 2020 EIP were determined by the
Compensation Committee using our fiscal 2020 operating plan as a benchmark and provide for appropriate
payout above or below target. The fiscal 2020 EIP target level for each performance measure was determined
by the Compensation Committee to be appropriately aggressive and aligned to our fiscal 2020 operating plan
and objectives. The fiscal 2020 targets were set higher than the fiscal 2019 actual results. For each
performance measure, the level of performance required increases at a fixed rate between each performance
level.
Strategic Milestones
For the Strategic Milestones, which account for 20% of the EIP Performance Factor, the Compensation
Committee selected (a) new product tape outs and launches tied to specified internal targeted delivery dates
and (b) achievement of various commercial/operations milestones relating to objectives for product yields and
quality, inventory, brand awareness, and commercial pipeline development. Each of the specific Strategic
Milestones is confidential, the disclosure of which would cause us competitive harm. When approved, the
Compensation Committee believed that each Strategic Milestone was challenging, yet reasonably achievable.
Based on our performance relative to the Financial Performance Targets and Strategic Milestones, the fiscal
2020 EIP reached 147% achievement. Based on management’s request to allocate a portion of the EIP funding
towards a discretionary end of year cash bonus for all employees below the level of Corporate Vice President,
the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion under the plan to modify achievement from 147% to
142%. At

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the end of fiscal 2020, our Chief Executive Officer assessed each Named Executive Officer’s performance,
except her own, and made bonus recommendations to the Compensation Committee for each of them. The
Compensation Committee then considered the Chief Executive Officer’s individual performance reviews and
bonus recommendations, and independently assessed the company’s performance and the individual
performance of the Chief Executive Officer and each of the other Named Executive Officers. Based on its
assessment of each of these factors and considering the company’s strong performance relative to the
Financial Performance Targets and Strategic Milestones, the Compensation Committee approved fiscal 2020
annual cash performance bonuses under the EIP for the Named Executive Officers as set forth below:

The amounts reported in this column reflect the bonus amounts approved by the Compensation

Mr. Grasby’s eligible base salary during fiscal 2020 of £410,000 was converted from British pounds to U.S.
dollars using an exchange rate of 1.356 U.S. dollars per 1.00 British pound, which was the exchange rate
reported by Bloomberg Financial as of December 26, 2020.
The Compensation Committee reviews and certifies the level of achievement for each performance measure
before any payments are made. This review and certification is generally performed at the first regularly
scheduled Compensation Committee meeting following the end of the year with any payout of the annual cash
performance bonus occurring in March of such year.
Long-Term Equity Awards
We believe that long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards provide a strong alignment
between the interests of our Named Executive Officers and our stockholders. The Compensation Committee
generally seeks to provide equity award opportunities that are consistent with our compensation philosophy
(with the potential for larger payments for exceptional performance). The Compensation Committee also
believes that long-term equity awards are an essential tool in promoting executive retention.
2020 Annual Equity Awards
In 2020, the Compensation Committee and, in Dr. Su’s case, the non-management members of the Board,
approved the following annual equity awards under our 2004 Plan, each of which was granted to the listed
Named Executive Officer on August 9, 2020:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Compensation Committee (the non-management members of the Board for Dr. Su) approved the aggregate
intended target value of each listed Named Executive Officer’s 2020 annual long-term equity award. As
reflected in the table above, the aggregate intended target value was converted into a mix of 50% PRSUs, 25%
RSUs and 25% stock options using a conversion price of $63.25 (the greater of $20.00 and the average closing
price of our common stock over the 30 trading-day period ending on August 9, 2020, the 2020 annual
program’s grant date) and, for the stock options, also using a factor of 45.36% that correlates to the value we
use for accounting purposes. These amounts do not include the separate retention equity award Mr. Grasby
received in February 2020, see “Retention Equity Award - Darren Grasby” below. The amounts reported in the
2020 Summary Compensation Table represent the grant date fair values (i.e., accounting values) of the 2020
long-term equity awards computed in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718.
In approving the aggregate intended target value of each Named Executive Officer’s 2020 annual long-term
equity award, the Compensation Committee (the non-management members of the Board for Dr. Su) reviewed
data showing the market-competitive award levels based on the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group and
the potential realizable value of each Named Executive Officer’s then-outstanding equity holdings.
Additionally, the Compensation Committee (the non-management members of the Board for Dr. Su) considered
the potential realizable value of each Named Executive Officer’s then-outstanding equity holdings, our
executive retention objectives and continuity within senior management and the following high-level
corporate goals: achieve fiscal 2020 financial results, execute industry-leading roadmap and meet customer
commitments. The achievement of these high-level goals drive our overall Company business strategy and,
correspondingly, the attainment of the performance objectives in our long-term incentive compensation
program.
2020 Annual PRSU Awards. The 2020 annual PRSU awards (the “2020 Annual PRSUs”) provide for a payout
that will range from 0% to 250% of the target number of shares of our common stock subject to the award (the
“Target Shares”). The actual number of shares earned by each Named Executive Officer will be calculated as
follows:
Each Named Executive Officer will earn between 0% and 200% of his or her target number of shares
(the “Initial Earned Shares”) depending on the return on our stock price relative to the return on the
S&P 500 Index, in each case over the Performance Period.
In alignment with our long-term growth strategy, we used EPS growth as an upside modifier to the
award. If we meet or exceed challenging pre-established non-GAAP EPS growth targets from our 2020
to our 2022 fiscal year, award payouts will be increased to 125% or 150% of each Named Executive
Officer’s Initial Earned Shares (if applicable, the “Adjusted Earned Shares”). In no event, however,
will the Named Executive Officer’s Adjusted Earned Shares exceed 250% of his or her target number of
shares.
If the return on our stock over the Performance Period is negative, then the total number of shares
earned by each Named Executive Officer will be reduced to 50% of his or her Adjusted Earned Shares.
If the return on our stock price over the Performance Period is equal to or greater than 0%, then the
total number of shares earned by each Named Executive Officer will be the number of his or her
Adjusted Earned Shares.
Any PRSUs that are earned will generally be settled on the later of August 16, 2023, or the date following the
Compensation Committee’s certification of our performance achievement. Each Named Executive Officer must
be continuously employed through the last day of the Performance Period to receive his or her earned shares,
except to the extent an event triggers accelerated vesting of the 2020 Annual PRSUs under the terms of his or
her employment or other agreement, as applicable.
Stock Options. Stock options are intended to align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with the
interests of our stockholders because they will not realize any financial benefit from these awards unless our
stock price increases above the exercise price over the seven-year option term. The stock options have an
exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, which was $84.85
per share. The stock options vest (and become exercisable) as to 33 ∕3% of the underlying shares on each of
231 
1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
August 9, 2021, August 9, 2022 and August 9, 2023, subject to each Named Executive Officer’s continued
employment with us through each vesting date (unless his or her employment agreement or other agreement
with us provides otherwise). The service-based vesting requirements are intended to further our retention
objectives. The stock options expire seven years after the grant date, subject to earlier expiration if the Named
Executive Officer’s employment with us terminates.
RSUs. RSUs are intended to encourage executive retention, manage share dilution, recognize individual
performance and align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with our stockholders because the value
of the awards is tied to the market value of our common stock at the time of vesting. All of the RSUs granted
to our Named Executive Officers in 2020 vest as to 33 ∕3% of the underlying shares on each of August 9, 2021,
August 9, 2022 and August 9, 2023, subject to each Named Executive Officer’s continued employment with us
through each vesting date (unless his or her employment agreement or other agreement with us provides
otherwise).
Retention Equity Award - Darren Grasby
In February 2020, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of a retention equity award to Mr. Grasby
having a target value of $4 million. The award was in recognition of his unique and significant contributions to
our fiscal 2019 performance and to encourage his retention through 2023. The target value of the retention
equity award was converted into a mix of 50% PRSUs and 50% time-based RSUs, which were granted on
February 15, 2020 under the terms of the 2004 Plan. The PRSUs have the same performance and service
vesting conditions as the PRSUs granted on August 9, 2019 to our fiscal 2019 Named Executive Officers and
which are described in detail in our definitive proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders
filed with the SEC on March 26, 2020. The time-based RSUs vest in three equal annual installments on each of
the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.
Accounting Considerations
We follow ASC Topic 718 for our share-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to
measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors,
including stock options, based on the grant date “fair value” of these awards. This calculation is performed
for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our Named Executive
Officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize
the compensation cost of their share-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period
that a recipient is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.
In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the accounting value of the 2020 Annual PRSUs and the retention PRSUs
to Mr. Grasby were calculated by an outside professional valuation consultant using a Monte-Carlo simulation
model and based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the probability-weighted payoffs of a share-based
payment assuming a variety of possible stock price paths and represents the estimate of aggregate
compensation cost to be recognized over the requisite service period determined as of the grant date under
ASC Topic 718, except no assumptions for forfeitures are included. The amounts reported in the 2020 Summary
Compensation Table include the grant date fair values (i.e., accounting values) of the awards.
Grant Timing Practices.
We have no practice or policy of coordinating or timing the release of company information around the grant
date of our annual long-term equity awards. Our annual long-term equity awards are typically granted in July
or August. On occasion, we grant equity awards outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires, promotions,
recognition, retention or other purposes. These “off cycle” awards are granted only on a limited basis.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Deferred Compensation
In 2020, our U.S.-based Named Executive Officers were eligible to participate in our Deferred Income Account
Plan (the “DIA Plan”). Participation in the DIA Plan is intended to assist our Named Executive Officers in their
retirement planning as well as to restore Company contributions that are lost due to IRS limits applicable to
contributions in our Section 401(k) plan. The Compensation Committee believes the opportunity to defer
compensation is a competitive benefit that enhances our ability to attract and retain talented executives while
building plan participants’ long-term commitment to AMD. Messrs. Kumar, Bergman and Papermaster
participated in the DIA Plan in 2020. For further information about the DIA Plan, see the “2020 Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation” table below.
Health, Welfare and Other Personal Benefits (Perquisites)
In 2020, a broad population of our U.S. employees, including our Named Executive Officers, were eligible to
receive the following health and welfare benefits:
participation in our U.S. benefit programs, including our Section 401(k) plan, health care coverage,
paid time-off and paid holidays;
matching contributions under our Section 401(k) plan, which were equal to 75% of an employee’s
annual contribution, up to the first 6% of compensation deferred under the plan; and
patent awards, if earned.
In addition to the above, our Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive an annual physical examination
and executive life insurance.
The health, welfare and other personal benefits described above are intended to be part of a competitive
overall compensation program and help attract and retain executive talent.
For further information regarding the health, welfare, perquisites and other personal benefits received by our
Named Executive Officers during 2020, see the “2020 Summary Compensation Table” below.
Change in Control Agreements and Arrangements
Our Chief Executive Officer has an employment agreement that establishes her base salary and provides for
annual incentive and long-term incentive awards under our approved plans (i.e., the EIP and 2004 Plan). In
addition, the agreement provides for certain payments and benefits in the event of certain termination of
employment scenarios, including following a change in control of AMD. For further information on this
agreement, see “Severance and Change in Control Arrangements.”
With the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, each of our other Named Executive Officers is party to a
change in control agreement with us. These agreements and the change-in-control provisions of Dr. Su’s
employment agreement are designed to encourage the continued services of the covered Named Executive
Officer in the event of a potential change in control of AMD and to allow for a smooth leadership transition
upon such a change in control. In addition, these agreements and the change-in-control provisions in Dr. Su’s
employment agreement are intended to provide incentives to the covered Named Executive Officer to
effectively execute the directives of the Board, even in the event that such actions may result in the
elimination of the Named Executive Officer’s position.
In April 2009, AMD adopted a policy to not enter into any new change in control agreements or arrangements
containing an excise tax gross-up provision. Our Named Executive Officers’ change in control agreements and
the change-in-control provisions of Dr. Su’s employment agreement do not provide for excise tax gross-ups.
233 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Termination of Employment Required to Trigger Payments
Under the terms and conditions of these change in control agreements and the change-in-control provisions
of Dr. Su’s employment agreement, each of our Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive certain specified
payments and benefits only if (a) a “change in control” of us occurs and (b) the Named Executive Officer’s
employment is terminated or the Named Executive Officer is constructively discharged within two years of the
change in control transaction (a “double trigger” arrangement). The Compensation Committee believes this
structure strikes a balance between our incentive arrangements and our executive hiring and retention
objectives without providing “windfall” payments and benefits to any Named Executive Officers who continue
employment with an acquiring entity following a change in control of AMD.
For a detailed description of these agreements and arrangements with our Named Executive Officers, as well as
an estimate of the amounts payable under such agreements and arrangements as of the last day of fiscal 2020,
see “Severance and Change in Control Arrangements.”
Severance and Separation Arrangements
Any post-employment compensation payable to our Chief Executive Officer is governed solely by her
employment agreement, the terms of which were the result of arms-length negotiations between her and the
Compensation Committee. Under her employment agreement, Dr. Su is eligible to receive certain specified
payments and benefits in the event that her employment is involuntarily terminated. The Compensation
Committee believes that the amount payable to Dr. Su pursuant to her employment agreement is reasonable
and competitive and provides transition assistance in the event of her involuntary termination of employment,
with the goal of keeping her focused on our business rather than her personal circumstances.
With the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, all of our other Named Executive Officers participate in our
Executive Severance Plan for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents (the “Executive Severance
Plan”). The Executive Severance Plan is designed to provide uniform treatment in the event of an involuntary
termination of employment of our U.S. senior executives (except our Chief Executive Officer) and to provide
transition assistance in such instances with the goal of keeping these senior executives focused on our
business rather than their personal circumstances. A Named Executive Officer is not eligible to receive
payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Plan if he or she receives severance payments and
benefits in connection with a change in control of AMD pursuant to his or her change in control agreement.
The Compensation Committee believes that the Executive Severance Plan provides the covered executives
important protections and promotes our objectives of attracting and retaining executive talent.
For a detailed description of the post-employment compensation arrangements of our Named Executive
Officers, as well as an estimate of the amounts payable under such arrangements as of the last day of fiscal
2020, see “Severance and Change in Control Arrangements.”
Other Compensation Policies
Compensation Recovery (“Claw-back”) Rights
Our Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct provide that we may pursue all remedies available under
applicable law to recover any incentive-based or other compensation (including equity awards) paid or
granted to our employees or agents in the event of such individual’s direct involvement with fraud,
misconduct or gross negligence which contributes to an accounting restatement as a result of our material
noncompliance with any financial reporting laws.
In addition, the award agreement for each stock option, RSU, and PRSU granted since May 2010 to an
employee at or above the level of senior vice president (which includes our Named Executive Officers) has
included a compensation recoupment (“claw-back”) provision. The claw-back provides the Compensation
Committee with the right to recover all or a portion of the compensation attributable to the award if the
employee’s direct involvement with fraud, misconduct or his or her gross negligence contributes to or results
in us being required to
234 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
prepare an accounting restatement as a result of our material noncompliance with any financial reporting
requirement under the federal securities laws. The claw-back does not apply to any award granted more than
18 months before the date of the first public issuance or SEC filing of the financial document embodying the
reporting requirement. In addition, (a) with respect to awards granted in and after August 2015, we may claw-
back the award if the recipient violates the non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality terms of the
award agreement as permitted under applicable law, or fails to comply with any agreement with us regarding
inventions, intellectual property rights, or proprietary information or material, and (b) with respect to awards
granted after May 2019, we may claw-back the award if the recipient engages in certain workplace misconduct
(including sexual harassment or age, sex or other prohibited discrimination) or a criminal act involving moral
turpitude. The Compensation Committee may exercise these claw-back rights by cancellation, forfeiture,
repayment or disgorgement of any profits realized by the employee from the sale of our securities.
We continue to monitor the rulemaking activities of the SEC and Nasdaq with respect to the development,
implementation and disclosure of compensation recovery provisions/policies. We expect to revise our
compensation recovery provisions/policies in the future if and as required by applicable law.
Stock Ownership Requirements
Our stock ownership requirements are designed to increase our Named Executive Officers’ stakes in us and to
align their interests more closely with those of our stockholders.
In August 2020, we increased our stock ownership requirements for our Named Executive Officers. These
requirements provide that on or before the Ownership Achievement Date (as defined below), our Chief
Executive Officer should attain an investment position in our common stock equal to the lesser of (a) six-times
her then- current annual base salary or (b) 350,000 shares, and our other Named Executive Officers should
attain an investment position in our common stock equal to the lesser of (x) 2.5 times their then-current annual
base salaries or (y) 80,000 shares.
Shares of our common stock counted toward the minimum stock ownership requirements include any shares
held directly or indirectly by a Named Executive Officer.
The “Ownership Achievement Date” is the later of August 7, 2025, or five years from first appointment as an
executive officer. Until the guideline is achieved, each Named Executive Officer is encouraged to retain at least
10% of the net shares (defined below) obtained through our stock incentive plans. For this purpose, the “net
shares” are the number of shares received from the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock
or restricted stock unit awards, less the number of shares the Named Executive Officer sells to cover the
exercise price of stock options or sells or has withheld to pay taxes.
As of December 26, 2020, each of our Named Executive Officers had satisfied his or her applicable stock
ownership requirement or has time remaining to do so.
Deductibility of Executive Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows public companies a tax deduction for federal income tax
purposes of remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers. While the Compensation
Committee may consider the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining our executive compensation,
it also considers other factors in making its executive compensation decisions and retains the flexibility to
grant awards or pay compensation the Compensation Committee determines to be consistent with its goals for
our executive compensation program, even if the awards may not be deductible for tax purposes.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the exception to the deductibility limit that was previously available for
“qualified performance-based compensation”  (including stock option grants, performance-based cash
bonuses and performance-based equity awards, such as the PRSUs) effective for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2017. As a result, any compensation paid to certain of our Named Executive Officers for taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2017 in excess of $1 million will be non-deductible unless it qualifies for
transition relief afforded by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to compensation payable pursuant to certain binding
arrangements in effect on November 2, 2017 and which are not subsequently materially modified.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
AMD Compensation Policies and Practices
In February 2020, the Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation policies and practices for
employees generally and concluded that these policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of management, assessed our
executive and broad-based compensation and benefits programs to determine if any of them created undesired
or excessive risks of a material nature. The assessment included (i) a review of our compensation policies and
practices for employees generally, (ii) identification of the risks that could result from such policies and
practices, (iii) identification of the risk mitigators and controls, and (iv) analysis of the potential risks against
the risk mitigators and controls and our business strategy and objectives. Although the Compensation
Committee reviewed our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee focused on the programs that
have variability of payout and in which employees could directly affect the payout of incentives. These
programs included the EIP, Annual Incentive Plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTI”), Sales Incentive Plan and
2004 Plan.
In performing the assessment and reaching its conclusion, the Compensation Committee noted the following
factors that the Compensation Committee believes may reduce the likelihood of undesired or excessive risk-
taking:
Our overall compensation levels are competitive with the market;
Our compensation practices and policies appropriately balance base pay versus variable pay and
short- term versus long-term incentives;
Although the EIP, Annual Incentive Plan, LTI and Sales Incentive Plan have variability of payout, the
Compensation Committee believes that any potential risks associated with such plans are controlled
or mitigated by one or more of the following: (i) the performance goals being multi-dimensional (i.e.,
adjusted non-GAAP net income, adjusted non-GAAP free cash flow, revenue), thereby increasing the
range of performance over which incentives are paid; (ii) the performance goals being aligned with
our business objectives and being quantitative financial measures; (iii) the use of sliding payout
scales, with the payouts in certain instances being linearly interpolated for performance falling
between the performance levels set by the Compensation Committee; (iv) the ability of the
Compensation Committee and/or management to exercise discretion to reduce payouts; (v) the
existence of multiple internal controls and approval processes that are intended to prevent
manipulation of outcomes by any employee, including the Named Executive Officers; and (vi) the
incentive opportunities being capped;
Although the grant of equity awards under the 2004 Plan could motivate our employees to, among
other things, focus on increasing our short-term stock price rather than the creation of long-term
stockholder value, the Compensation Committee believes that potential risks are controlled or
mitigated by one or more of the following: (i) awarding a combination of PRSUs, RSUs and stock
options; (ii) three-year vesting and performance period for PRSUs awarded in fiscal 2019 and 2020
(with the exception of the Value Creation Equity Awards granted in fiscal 2019, which have a five-year
performance period); (iii) the vesting provisions of stock options and RSUs occurring over multi-year
periods; (iv) caps on performance-based compensation opportunities; and (v) our stock ownership
guidelines for our executive officers. In addition, we prohibit our employees, including Named
Executive Officers, from engaging in hedging transactions in our securities; and
We have implemented claw-back provisions and policies, as described in more detail in
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above.

For fiscal 2019, amounts represent (i) a retention bonus payment of $545,187 for Mr. Grasby and (ii) a sign-on
bonus payment of $500,000 for Mr. Bergman.
Amounts shown in the column do not reflect dollar amounts actually received by the Named Executive Officers.
Instead, these amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the RSUs and PRSUs granted in the year
indicated computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. The grant date fair value (which is sometimes referred to
herein as the “accounting value”) is used to recognize the accounting expense for long-term equity awards. For fiscal
2020, the amounts shown include the grant date fair value of the PRSUs awarded in fiscal 2020 to each Named
Executive Officer, as set forth in the table below. The grant date fair value of the PRSUs is determined using a
Monte-Carlo simulation model and based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the probability-weighted payoffs
of a share-based payment assuming a variety of possible stock price paths and represents the estimate of the most
probable aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the requisite service period determined as of the grant
date under ASC Topic 718. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuations reflected in this column, see
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report.
The aggregate accounting values of the PRSUs granted to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2020 are as follows:

Cash amounts received by Mr. Grasby are paid in British pounds. Amounts represented for Mr. Grasby are based on
an exchange rate of 1.356 U.S. dollars per British pound, which was the exchange rate as of December 26, 2020, as
reported by Bloomberg Financial.
The maximum number of shares that may be earned for the PRSU granted to Mr. Grasby on February 15, 2020 is
capped at the number equal to (i) twelve times the target value of the PRSU award, divided by (ii) the closing price
of our common stock on the last day of the three-year performance period ending on August 9, 2021, or the date of a
change of control of the Company, if earlier.
In accordance with Instruction 3 to Item 402(c)(2)(v), assuming that the highest level of performance conditions of
the PRSUs granted to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2020 will be achieved, the maximum possible value of
the PRSUs, using our stock price on the grant date of the PRSUs, is: $23,216,233 for Dr. Su; $4,695,175 for Mr.
Kumar; $4,527,384 for Mr. Bergman; $8,483,303 and $3,279,192, respectively, for Mr. Grasby; and $6,036,653 for
Mr. Papermaster.
Amounts include (i) a company service anniversary award to Mr. Kumar, available to all employees, and (ii) car
allowance and home working allowance in the United Kingdom for Mr. Grasby.

Amounts represent PRSUs. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Fiscal 2020 Compensation Elements - Long-
Term Equity Awards” above for more information about the PRSUs, including the pre-established performance periods and
performance measures, and see footnotes to the “Outstanding Equity Awards at 2020 Fiscal Year-End” table above for a
description of the PRSU vesting schedules. Also see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Fiscal 2020 Compensation
Elements - Long-Term Equity Awards - Value Creation Equity Awards” above for more information about the Value
Creation Equity Awards.
Amounts represent time-based RSUs. See footnotes to the “Outstanding Equity Awards at 2020 Fiscal Year-End” table
above for a description of the RSU vesting schedules.
Amounts represent stock options. See footnotes to the “Outstanding Equity Awards at 2020 Fiscal Year-End” table above
for a description of the stock option vesting schedules. The stock options expire seven years after the grant date.
Amounts reflect the grant date fair value of the respective award computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Regardless
of the value on the grant date, the actual value that may be realized from an award is contingent upon the satisfaction of
the applicable conditions to vesting of that award, and for stock options, also upon the excess of AMD’s stock price over
the exercise price. With respect to the PRSUs, in accordance with SEC rules, amounts reflect the fair value at the grant
date determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model and based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the probability-
weighted payoffs of a share-based payment assuming a variety of possible stock price paths and represents the estimate of
aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the requisite service period determined as of the grant date under ASC
Topic 718. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation reflected in these amounts, see Note 11 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report.

Amount is included in the “Salary” column for fiscal 2020 of the “2020 Summary Compensation Table” above.
Represents the net amounts debited from the DIA accounts of Messrs. Kumar, Bergman and Papermaster as a result of the
performance of the investment vehicles in which their accounts were deemed invested, as more fully described in the
narrative disclosure below. These amounts do not represent above-market or preferential earnings (within the meaning of
17 CFR Section 229.402(c)(2)(viii)), and as a result are not reported in the “2020 Summary Compensation Table” above.
Mr. Bergman’s balance includes $199,922 that was reported as compensation in the “Summary Compensation Table.” No
other aggregate amounts were reported as compensation for the Named Executive Officers in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
We maintain the DIA, which allows eligible employees, including the Named Executive Officers, to voluntarily
defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus and any commission payments until the date or dates selected
by the participant. Participants may defer up to 50% of annual base salary and/or 100% of commissions and
bonuses. Earnings on the deferred accounts are based on the performance of the investment funds selected
by the participants. Participants make a deferral election, prior to the year in which the compensation is
earned, that may not be terminated or changed during the year for which it was made. Generally, we make a
discretionary contribution to the participant’s account if his or her annual base salary, minus his or her
Section 401(k) contribution before the deferral, is greater than the annual compensation limit for Section 401(k)
plans. The contribution, if any, is equal to the lesser of (i) 50% of the deferred compensation credited to the
participant’s account for the year or (ii) a discretionary percentage of the participant’s base salary in excess of
the eligible Section 401(k) compensation limit for the year minus the participant’s Section 401(k) contributions.
For 2020, our discretionary contribution percentage under option (ii) above was 4.5%. Participants are 100%
vested in the value of their accounts. Participants may select their desired benchmark investment fund(s) in
which their accounts are deemed to be invested and may change their investment elections at any time, with
such change effective as of the next business day. The amount of investment gain or loss that is credited to
the participant’s account depends on the participant’s investment election. For 2020, we utilized investment
funds in an array of asset classes, substantially aligned to those offered under our Section 401(k) plan. We
have placed assets in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the DIA. For 2020, the investment
return credited to Messrs. Kumar’s, Bergman’s and Papermaster’s DIA accounts was 23.0%, 41.7%, and 7.8%,
respectively, based
243 
(1)
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
on their investment elections for their respectiveDIA accounts. This investment return was calculated by
taking the aggregate gain in fiscal 2020 and dividing it by the aggregate balance as of the beginning of fiscal
2020.
The DIA accounts are distributed following a participant’s termination of employment with us unless the
participant has elected an in-service withdrawal (scheduled or hardship withdrawal). At the time a participant
makes his or her deferral election, he or she may elect a different form of distribution for such year’s deferred
compensation. The participant may elect a single lump sum distribution or annual installment distributions
over three to ten years. The default form of distribution is a single lump sum. A participant may change the
form of distribution election, subject to the terms of the DIA.
A participant may elect to withdraw all or part of his or her account while employed by us, subject to the terms
of the DIA. The in-service withdrawal date must be at least two years after the plan year in which the election
was made. An in-service withdrawal date may be changed, subject to the terms of the DIA. An unscheduled
payment may also be made, subject to the terms of the DIA.
Severance and Change in Control Arrangements
We have entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Su, our current President and Chief Executive Officer.
In addition, Messrs. Kumar, Bergman, Grasby and Papermaster participate in the Executive Severance Plan and
have each entered into a change in control agreement with us.
The Executive Severance Plan and change in control agreements are designed to (i) implement a uniform
process for handling potential future involuntary departures of the Named Executive Officers, and (ii)
encourage the Named Executive Officers’ continued services in the event of a potential change in control of
us and to allow for a smooth transition upon such a change in control. In addition, these arrangements are
intended to provide incentives to the Named Executive Officers to effectively execute the directives of the
Board, even in the event that such actions may result in the elimination of a Named Executive Officer’s
position. Under the terms of the change in control agreements, a Named Executive Officer is eligible to receive
certain specified compensatory payments and benefits only if (i) a “change in control” occurs, and (ii) the
Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated, or the Named Executive Officer is constructively
discharged, within two years of that change in control.
Dr. Su’s Employment Agreement. Pursuant to Dr. Su’s at-will employment agreement (the “Su Employment
Agreement”), setting forth Dr. Su’s duties and obligations as our President and Chief Executive Officer, the Su
Employment Agreement may be terminated by (i) us for Cause (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement),
(ii) Dr. Su’s Involuntary Termination Without Cause (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement), (iii) Dr.
Su’s Constructive Termination (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement), (iv) Dr. Su’s voluntary election
to terminate her employment with us, or (v) Dr. Su’s death or disability.
Except as otherwise described in the next paragraph, in the event of Dr. Su’s Involuntary Termination Without
Cause or Constructive Termination, subject to Dr. Su’s execution of a full release of claims, which remains
effective, following such termination:
Dr. Su will be credited with an additional 12 months of service for purposes of calculating the service-
based vesting of any unvested equity awards granted to Dr. Su on or after October 8, 2014 and 24
months of service for purposes of calculating the service-based vesting of any unvested equity
awards granted to Dr. Su before October 8, 2014. Any performance-based equity award for which the
service-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of the date of termination will continue in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement and will be earned or forfeited based on
actual performance for the applicable performance period. The settlement of any earned performance-
based equity award will occur at such time as such performance-based equity award would have been
settled had Dr. Su continued her employment with us;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
We will make a lump-sum cash payment to Dr. Su in an amount equal to two times her then base
salary;
We will pay Dr. Su the pro rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the EIP, based on actual
performance for the year of termination and paid at the time annual bonuses are paid to other
executives; and
We will, for 24 months following the date of termination, pay Dr. Su an amount equal to the COBRA
premium for continuation coverage for herself and her dependents (if applicable) under our group
medical and dental plans on a monthly basis.
In the event of Dr. Su’s Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination between the
public announcement of a transaction that results in our Change of Control (as defined in the Su Employment
Agreement) and 24 months after such Change of Control, subject to Dr. Su’s execution of a full release of
claims, which remains effective, following such termination:
We will pay Dr. Su her earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination and all other
amounts to which Dr. Su is entitled under any of our compensation plans or practices on the date of
termination;
All unvested equity awards then held by Dr. Su will accelerate and be deemed fully vested, and all
such equity awards then-outstanding that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, other
than Dr. Su’s Value Creation Equity Award, will be deemed achieved at the target levels set forth in the
applicable award agreement;
We will make a lump-sum cash payment to Dr. Su in an amount equal to two times her base salary plus
two times her target annual bonus, in each case at the rate in effect immediately before the date of
termination or, if higher, the rate in effect six months before the date of termination;
We will pay Dr. Su the pro rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the EIP assuming
performance at target levels for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination; and
We will, for 24 months following the date of termination, pay Dr. Su an amount equal to the COBRA
premium for continuation coverage for herself and her dependents (if applicable) under our group
medical and dental plans on a monthly basis. In addition, we will pay Dr. Su $4,000 per month for 12
months following the date of termination for financial planning and tax planning services.
Under the terms of the Su Employment Agreement, upon a termination of employment in connection with a
change in control, Dr. Su’s severance payments and benefits will be made in full or as to such lesser amount
as would result in no portion of the payments being subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code (relating to Section 280G of the Code), whichever of the foregoing amounts is greater on an after-tax
basis (i.e., a parachute payment cut-back).
Executive Severance Plan for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents. With the exception of
Dr. Su, all of the Named Executive Officers participated in the Executive Severance Plan as of the end of 2020.
Under the terms of the Executive Severance Plan, any participant who (i) is involuntarily terminated other than
for cause (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan) or as a result of death or disability (as defined in the
Executive Severance Plan) and (ii) is not offered a job with one of our affiliates or a successor of us, will be
entitled to the following benefits, subject to the participant’s execution of a full release of claims, which
remains effective, following such termination:
We will make a lump-sum cash payment to the participant in an amount equal to 12 months of base
salary;
We will, for 12 months following the date of termination, pay COBRA premiums for continuation
coverage under our group medical and dental plans; and
We will allow participants to use our Employee Assistance Plan for up to 12 months.

Additionally, we will seek reimbursement on a pro rata basis, of severance benefits if we re-employ a
participant during the 12 months following receipt of a severance payment under the SVP Severance Plan.
The Executive Severance Plan is intended to represent the exclusive severance benefits payable to a
participant by us. Accordingly, any Participant who is entitled to receive severance benefits payable in
connection with a change of control pursuant to a change in control agreement may not also receive
severance benefits under the SVP Severance Plan. In other words, a participant may not collect severance
benefits under the SVP Severance Plan if he or she receives benefits under a change in control agreement with
us.
Although we expect to maintain the Executive Severance Plan indefinitely, we may amend, modify or terminate
the Executive Severance Plan at any time. Therefore, severance benefits under the Executive Severance Plan
are not guaranteed and may be eliminated in the future. The form of release agreement used under our
Executive Severance Plan includes a customary non-disparagement agreement and a one-year employee non-
solicitation agreement.
Change in Control Agreements. We entered into change in control agreements with Messrs. Kumar, Bergman,
Grasby and Papermaster designed to encourage their continued services in the event of a change in control.
For purposes of these change in control agreements, a change in control generally means any of the following
events:
the acquisition by any person representing more than 50% of our then outstanding shares of stock or
the combined voting power of our voting securities;
a change of the majority of the Board during any two consecutive years, unless certain Board
approval conditions are met;
a merger or consolidation of us into any other corporation, where immediately after the merger or
consolidation 50% or less of the combined voting power is held by holders of our voting securities
immediately before such merger or consolidation; or
the stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or there is a consummated a sale of all or
substantially all of our assets.
The change in control agreements provide that, if within two years after a change in control, the Named
Executive Officer’s employment is terminated by us without cause or they are constructively discharged, the
Named Executive Officer will receive:
a lump sum severance benefit equal to the sum of two times the executive’s rate of annual base
compensation at the rate in effect immediately before the date of termination or, if higher, the rate in
effect six months before the date of the change in control, plus two times the target annual bonus in
the year of termination;
all unvested equity will vest and be exercisable, and options may be exercised for the period of one
year from the date of termination or the original option term, whatever is shorter;
payment of the executive’s prorated accrued bonus assuming performance at target levels for the
portion of the year prior to the date of termination;
reimbursement of personal financial and tax planning up to $4,000 for twelve months following the
date of termination; and
12 months’ continued health and welfare benefits comparable to those in effect at termination and a
gross-up for any income taxes due as a result of the payment by us for such health and welfare
benefits.
The payments and benefits pursuant to the change in control agreements are subject to the executive’s
execution of a release of claims. Further, upon a termination of employment in connection with a change in
control, the executive’s severance payments and benefits will be made in full or as to such lesser amount as
would result in
246 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
no portion of the payments being subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (relating to
Section 280G of the Code), whichever of the foregoing amounts is greater on an after-tax basis (i.e., a
parachute payment cut-back).
AMD Policies. In April 2009, we adopted a policy to, in general, not enter into any new change in control
agreements or arrangements containing an excise tax gross-up provision. Dr. Su’s change in control agreement
does not provide for an excise tax gross-up.
In March 2010, we also adopted a policy to not enter into any new change in control agreement or
arrangement with any executive officer that provides for a cash severance payment (upon both our change in
control and a subsequent termination of employment) in excess of (i) two times the sum of the respective
executive officer’s base salary and annual target bonus, plus (ii) a prorated annual target bonus for the year in
which the termination of employment occurs. Dr. Su’s change in control agreement complies with this
limitation.
Vesting of Awards. All RSUs and stock options granted under our equity incentive plans become fully vested
(i) if our successor refuses to assume or substitute similar awards for outstanding awards, upon a change in
control, or (ii) if our successor assumes or substitutes similar awards for outstanding awards and the
participant’s employment is terminated by our successor for any reason (other than for misconduct) or by the
participant due to a constructive termination within one year following a change in control, upon such
termination of employment. All PRSUs vest to the extent the applicable performance criteria were achieved.
Upon a change in control, the Compensation Committee shall determine and approve the Company’s
performance with respect to the applicable performance vesting conditions as of the effective date of the
change in control and the participant will be deemed to have earned that number of PRSUs, which will be
converted automatically into an equal number of RSUs that will vest as of the first to occur of (i) the one-year
anniversary of the change in control or (ii) the last day of the originally scheduled performance period. All
remaining unearned PRSUs will be automatically forfeited without consideration. If the participant’s
employment or service with the Company is involuntarily terminated for any reason (other than misconduct)
after a change in control, then all such converted RSUs will become fully vested as of the date of termination.
Upon death or disability, the participant or the participant’s estate shall have the right for a period of twelve
(12) months following the date of death or termination of status as a service provider to exercise any stock
options to the extent the participant was entitled to exercise such stock options on the date of death or
termination. For the Value Creation Equity Awards, if Dr. Su incurs a “covered termination”  (as defined in her
employment agreement) or if Mr. Papermaster’s employment with the Company is involuntarily terminated
(other than for misconduct) during the performance period, then (a) the unvested earned Value Creation Equity
Awards held by Dr. Su or Mr. Papermaster, as applicable, that were scheduled to vest on or before the one-
year anniversary of the termination date will immediately vest and (b) the unvested unearned Value Creation
Equity Awards held by Dr. Su or Mr. Papermaster, as applicable, will remain outstanding for 12 months (or, if
earlier, until August 9, 2024 or the date of a change in control) and vest if such Value Creation Equity Awards
would have vested had he or she remained employed in a covered position for such period.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. The following table presents the amount of
compensation and benefits payable to Dr. Su under her employment agreement in the event of (i) an
involuntary termination without cause or a constructive termination (without a change in control), (ii) an
involuntary termination without cause or a constructive termination immediately following the consummation
of a change in control and (iii) a separation due to death. As required by SEC rules, the amounts shown
assume that the termination or death was effective as of December 26, 2020, exclude amounts earned through
that time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to Dr. Su. For purposes of the below
calculations, the value of each share of our common stock underlying an option, RSU or PRSU is assumed to
be $91.81, the last reported sales price of our common stock on December 24, 2020, the last trading day of our
fiscal 2020.

Amount represents two times Dr. Su’s base salary of $1,055,000.
Amount represents two times Dr. Su’s base salary of $1,055,000, plus two times her pro-rated target annual bonus.
Amount represents the pro rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the EIP based on actual 2020 performance
for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination.
Amount represents the pro rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the EIP assuming performance at target
levels for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination.
Amounts represents the value of unvested stock options that would have vested during the 12-month period after
her termination. The value of each option is the excess of the aggregate value of the underlying shares over the
aggregate exercise price of the option.
Amount represents the value of all unvested and accelerated stock options. The value of each option is the excess of
the aggregate value of the underlying shares over the aggregate exercise price of the option. Amounts shown also
reflect the value of stock option acceleration in the event of a change in control if our successor refuses to assume or
substitute similar awards for outstanding stock options, pursuant to our equity incentive plans.
Amount reflects the value of unvested RSUs and PRSUs that would have vested during the 12-month period after
her termination. The number of PRSUs payable reflects achievement for the 2018 grant as of December 26, 2020,
which is limited by the 8x value cap. The actual number of PRSUs payable could be higher or lower and will not be
known until August 9, 2021, the last day of the performance period.
Amount reflects the value of all unvested RSUs and PRSUs that would become vested upon Dr. Su’s qualifying
termination immediately following the consummation of a change in control. The number of PRSUs payable reflects
achievement as of December 26, 2020, at the following levels: 2018 annual PRSU award (250% of target, but limited
by the 8x value cap), 2019 annual PRSU award (250% of target), Value Creation Equity Award (200% of target), and
2020 annual PRSU award (167% of Target). Upon the occurrence of a change in control, the PRSUs convert into a
number of time-based RSUs determined based on achievement as of the date of the change in control. These time-
based RSUs would immediately vest upon Dr. Su’s qualifying termination immediately following the change in
control.
Amount represents our cost of paying COBRA premiums on behalf of Dr. Su and her dependents for 24 months
following her termination based on rates for a current employee.
Pursuant to our Executive Life Insurance Benefit Plan, amount reflects a life insurance payout equal to three times
Dr. Su’s base salary of $1,055,000, subject to a maximum of $2,000,000.
Pursuant to Dr. Su’s employment agreement, she is entitled to $4,000 per month in financial planning for a 12-month
period following termination.
In the event that the severance and other benefits provided would be subject to excise taxes imposed by Section
280G and Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such amount will either be delivered in full or reduced so as
not to be subject to excise taxation, whichever amount is higher, pursuant to the terms of Dr. Su’s Employment
Agreement.
The following table presents the amount that would be payable to Messrs. Kumar, Bergman, Grasby and
Papermaster (i) under the Executive Severance Plan assuming an involuntary termination of employment
without cause outside of a change in control, (ii) under their respective change in control agreements, in each
case assuming a termination of employment without cause or a constructive discharge that occurred within 24
months of a change in control, and (iii) in the event of a separation due to death or disability. As required by
SEC rules, the amounts shown assume that such termination or death was effective as of December 26, 2020,
exclude amounts earned through that time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the

Under the Executive Severance Plan, the value of the severance benefit following an involuntary termination or
separation due to death or disability is equal to a single lump sum severance payment equivalent to 12 months of base pay.
Under the change in control agreements with each of Messrs. Kumar, Bergman, Grasby and Papermaster, the value of the
severance benefit following a termination without cause or a constructive termination within two years after a change in
control is equal to a single lump sum severance payment equivalent to two times the executive’s rate of annual base pay,
plus two times the target annual bonus in the year of termination. These calculations assume compensation rates as of
December 26, 2020 (and for Mr. Grasby, conversion of his compensation from British pounds to U.S. dollars using an
exchange rate of 1.356 U.S. dollars per 1.00 British pound, which was the exchange rate reported by Bloomberg Financial
as of December 26, 2020).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Amount represents the pro rata amount of the executive’s annual bonus accrued under the EIP assuming performance at
target levels for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination.
Amount represents the value of all unvested and accelerated stock options. The value of each stock option is the excess
of the aggregate value of the underlying shares over the aggregate exercise price of the option. Amounts shown also
reflect the value of stock option acceleration in the event of a change in control if our successor refuses to assume or
substitute similar awards for outstanding stock options, pursuant to our equity incentive plans.
Amount represents the value of all unvested and accelerated RSUs and PRSUs. The number of PRSUs payable reflects
achievement as of December 26, 2020 at the following levels, based on the year of grant: 2018 annual PRSU award
(250% of target, but limited by the 8x value cap), 2019 annual PRSU award (250% of target) and 2020 annual PRSU
award (167% of Target). For Mr. Papermaster, the number of PRSUs payable also reflects achievement under his Value
Creation Equity Award at 200% of target. Upon the occurrence of a change in control, the PRSUs (including Mr.
Papermaster’s Value Creation Equity Award) convert into a number of time-based RSUs determined based on achievement
as of the date of the change in control. These time-based RSUs would immediately vest upon the Named Executive
Officer’s qualifying termination immediately following the change in control.
Under the Executive Severance Plan, the value of the health and welfare benefit following an involuntary termination is
equal to 12 months of COBRA medical, dental and/or vision insurance premiums, based on the participant’s benefits plan
elections in effect at the time of termination, and use of the employee assistance plan provided by us as part of the 12
months of COBRA coverage.
Amount reflects our annual cost of paying COBRA premiums on behalf of Messrs. Kumar, Bergman and Papermaster for
12 months following termination based on the rates of a current employee. Also includes gross-ups for income taxes in
the amounts of $16,755, $8,001, and $26,687 due by Messrs. Kumar, Bergman and Papermaster, respectively, as a result
of our payment of health and welfare benefits on their behalf. Mr. Grasby does not participate in AMD’s medical or
dental plans.
Pursuant to our Executive Life Insurance Benefit Plan, amount reflects a life insurance payout equal to three times the
Named Executive Officer’s base salary, which is $580,000 for Mr. Kumar, $600,000 for Mr. Bergman, $555,960 for Mr.
Grasby and $625,000 for Mr. Papermaster.
In the event that the severance and other benefits provided would be subject to excise taxes imposed by Section 280G and
Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such amount will either be delivered in full or reduced so as not to be subject
to excise taxation, whichever amount is higher, pursuant to the terms of our Change in Control Agreement.

Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio
For 2020:
the annual total compensation for the median employee of the Company (other than our Chief
Executive Officer) was $118,959; and
the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer was $27,141,878.
Based on this information, for 2020 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to
the annual total compensation of the median employee was 228 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate
calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. As permitted by SEC rules, to identify our median employee, we selected total estimated compensation
which we calculated as annual base pay plus the target bonus plus the intended value of stock awards, as the
compensation measure to be used to compare the total estimated compensation of our employees as of
December 1, 2020. We annualized base pay and estimated bonus for any regular employees who commenced
work during 2020 and did not annualize these amounts for temporary and seasonal employees. The annual
total compensation of the median employee and the annual total compensation of the CEO were calculated in
accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, and the median employee’s annual
total compensation was converted to U.S. dollars using a currency exchange rate as of December 26, 2020.
For additional details on the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, see “Compensation Discussion
and Analysis.”

Treatment of Xilinx Equity Awards
Stock Options
At the effective time, each outstanding Xilinx stock option held by employees of Xilinx, including executive
officers, will be automatically converted into a stock option to acquire a number of shares of AMD common
stock determined based on the exchange ratio (with the exercise price with respect to such option being
adjusted based on the exchange ratio). At the Effective Time, each outstanding Xilinx stock option, whether
vested or unvested, held by non-employee members of the Xilinx board of directors, will accelerate in full.
Aside from the foregoing adjustments, Xilinx stock options will generally remain subject to the same vesting
and other terms and conditions that applied to such awards immediately prior to the effective time.
As of February 10, 2021, no executive officer or director held any vested or unvested Xilinx stock options.
Xilinx RSUs
At the effective time, each outstanding award of Xilinx RSUs with vesting criteria based on continuing service
that is outstanding and held by an employee of Xilinx immediately prior to the effective time, will be
automatically converted into an award of AMD RSUs covering shares of AMD common stock based on the
exchange ratio.
At the effective time, each outstanding award of Xilinx RSUs with performance-based vesting criteria that is
outstanding and held by an employee of Xilinx immediately prior to the effective time, after giving effect to
Xilinx’s determination (based on actual or, in the event consummation of the merger occurs during or after
Xilinx’s 2022 fiscal year, the greater of target-level and actual, performance through a date that is not less than
ten business days prior to the effective time) of Xilinx RSUs earned, will be (to the extent earned)
automatically converted into an award of AMD RSUs covering shares of AMD common stock based on the
exchange ratio, and all unearned performance-based Xilinx RSUs will be forfeited.
At the Effective Time, the vesting of each outstanding award of Xilinx RSUs held by non-employee members
of the Xilinx board of directors will accelerate in full and become settled.
Aside from the foregoing adjustments, Xilinx RSUs will generally remain subject to the same vesting and other
terms and conditions that applied to such awards immediately prior to the effective time.

by AMD. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no compensation arrangements between such
persons and AMD and/or its affiliates have been established.
Xilinx Chief Executive Officer Employment Agreement
Xilinx maintains an employment agreement with Victor Peng providing for Mr. Peng’s employment with the
Xilinx as President and Chief Executive Officer.
Under Mr. Peng’s employment agreement, if Xilinx terminates Mr. Peng’s employment at any time due to
disability or other than for “Cause” or if Mr. Peng voluntarily terminates his employment for “Good Reason”
(as each such term is defined in his employment agreement) then, subject to Mr. Peng’s execution of a release
of claims in favor of the Xilinx, he will be eligible for:
a pro rata portion of his bonus for the fiscal year during which his employment was terminated based
on (a) his termination date, (b) the determination by Xilinx’s compensation committee whether Xilinx
performance objectives have been met and (c) an assumption that any individual performance
objectives have been achieved at target;
a lump sum payment equal to one year of his then-current base salary;
a lump sum payment equal to one year of his annual target bonus;
at Xilinx’s election, a lump sum payment equal to, or payment of, one year of COBRA premiums for
medical and dental insurance; and
24 months’ accelerated vesting of all equity grants received from Xilinx prior to his termination of
employment, provided that (a) in the case of performance-based RSUs for which the number of
earned RSUs has not been determined as of the date of termination, the number of accelerated shares
will be the actual number of RSUs earned for actual performance achievement that would have
vested in the 24 months following termination of employment (such performance to be determined by
Xilinx’s compensation committee within two and one-half months after the end of the fiscal year in

termination occurs), had the original vesting schedule provided for monthly rather than annual
vesting, and (b) in the case of any outstanding awards of RSUs that are not subject to performance
metrics and that are subject to “cliff” vesting on one or more anniversaries of the date of grant, such
RSUs will be treated as instead being subject to monthly vesting in equal installments from the
applicable date of grant, and Mr. Peng will become vested in that number of RSUs which would have
vested during the period commencing from the date of grant and continuing up to his termination
date and during an additional 24-month period following his termination date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mr. Peng’s employment is terminated at any time within 90 days prior to or
two years following a change of control and he executes a release of claims in favor of Xilinx, he will be eligible
for:
a pro rata portion of his bonus for the fiscal year during which his employment was terminated based
on (a) his termination date, (b) the determination by Xilinx’s compensation committee whether Xilinx
performance objectives have been met and (c) an assumption that any individual performance
objectives have been achieved at target;
a lump sum payment equal to 24 months of his then-current base salary;
a lump sum payment equal to two years of his annual target bonus;
a lump sum payment equal to, or payment of, one year of COBRA premiums for medical and dental
insurance;
100% accelerated vesting of all non-performance-based equity awards; and
100% accelerated vesting of performance-based RSUs at 100% of target.
Xilinx Change of Control Arrangements with Executive Officers
Xilinx entered into change of control agreements with each of its executive officers, other than Mr. Peng,
which provide certain benefits if the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with a change of
control of Xilinx. Under the change of control agreements, if the employment of the executive is terminated
without “Cause” or the executive resigns pursuant to a “Constructive Termination” at any time within 90 days
prior to or two years following a change of control (in each case, as defined in the change of control
agreement), and subject to the executive’s execution of a release of claims in favor of Xilinx, the executive will
be eligible for:
a lump sum payment equal to 150% of the executive’s then-current base salary;
a lump sum payment equal to 150% of the executive’s annual target bonus;
a lump sum payment equal to, or payment of, one year of COBRA premiums for medical and dental
insurance, if the executive elects continuation coverage under COBRA;
for each executive officer other than Mr. Hill, 100% accelerated vesting of all non-performance-based
equity awards;
for each executive officer other than Mr. Hill, 100% accelerated vesting of performance-based RSUs
at 100% of target; and
for Mr. Hill, if his termination date occurs after a change of control, he will be eligible for the
following: if the change of control occurs before the first anniversary of Mr. Hill’s employment start
date (which is April 9, 2020), then 25% of his equity awards shall vest; if the change of control
occurs between the first and second anniversaries of Mr. Hill’s employment start date, then 50% of
his equity awards shall vest; and if the change of control occurs after the second anniversary of Mr.
Hill’s employment start date, then 100% of his equity awards shall vest.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Xilinx Named Executive Officers
The following information, table and the related footnotes present information about the compensation
payable to Xilinx named executive officers in connection with the merger.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The narrative and tables that follow are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur. They describe potential payments and benefits to the named executive officers under their existing
agreements, including payments and benefits that would be due to them in connection with the occurrence of
a change of control, assuming the closing date occurred on February 10, 2021 and that each named executive
officer experienced a qualifying termination of employment on such closing date. The equity award values are
calculated based on the average closing market price of Xilinx common stock over the five-day period
commencing on October 28, 2020, or $120.13. The actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may differ from the amounts set forth below.

to two years of his annual target bonus), which he is eligible to receive pursuant to the terms of his
employment agreement, payable in connection with a qualifying termination of employment
following a change of control (including the merger), and accordingly these amounts are “double
trigger” payments (that is, they are payable upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a
qualifying termination that occurs 90 days prior to or two years following a change of control). For
the other named executive officers, represents the cash severance payment (based on 150% of their
then-current base salary and 150% of their annual target bonus) that they are eligible to receive
pursuant to the terms of their change of control agreements, payable in connection with a qualifying
termination of employment following a change of control (including the merger), and accordingly
these amounts are also “double trigger” payments.
Equity. Represents the value of accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested Xilinx restricted stock
units (based on the assumptions described below. As described under “Interests of Xilinx’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” these equity awards will be assumed by AMD and
converted into AMD awards. The values in the equity column of the table above reflect the
accelerated vesting terms of the executives’ change of control agreements and for Mr. Peng, his
employment agreement and the following assumptions:
the named executive officer’s employment is terminated by Xilinx without cause or by the officer
for good reason or constructive termination, as applicable, such that the named executive
officer’s outstanding and unvested assumed Xilinx equity awards will vest in full (or, for Mr. Hill,
25% of his awards shall vest), which is a double-trigger benefit; and

the values for the equity awards are calculated based on a price per share value of $120.13, which
was the average closing market price of Xilinx common stock over the five-day period
commencing on October 28, 2020.
Perquisites / Benefits. For each of the named executive officers, represents the cost of premiums for
twelve months’ continuation of the same or reasonably equivalent medical and dental insurance
coverage which becomes payable upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change
of control (including the merger), and accordingly these amounts are “double trigger” payments.
Total. This amount includes the aggregate dollar value of the sum of all amounts reported in the
preceding columns. In the event any payment or benefit received by a named executive officer in
connection with the merger would be subject to excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the
Code, the amount of such payments or benefits provided would be reduced, but only to the extent
such reduction results in a greater after-tax benefit to the named executive officer.

The following discussion is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S.
Holders (as defined below) of Xilinx common stock that exchange their Xilinx common stock for AMD common
stock in the merger. This discussion is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder,
judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to
differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner
that could affect the accuracy of the statement and conclusions set forth in this discussion and could
adversely affect a U.S. Holder. We have not sought and do not intend to seek any rulings from the IRS
regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary
position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the merger. This discussion assumes that
the merger will be consummated in accordance with the merger agreement and as further described in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. This discussion is not a complete description of all of the tax consequences of
the merger and, in particular, does not address any tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution
tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax, nor does it address any tax consequences arising
under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction, or under any U.S. federal laws other than those
pertaining to the income tax.
This discussion applies only to U.S. Holders of Xilinx common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (or any similar state, local or non-U.S. legal requirement)
(generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to address all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to U.S. Holders of Xilinx common stock in light of their
particular circumstances and does not apply to U.S. Holders of Xilinx common stock subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws including, without limitation:
banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions;
tax-exempt and governmental organizations;
partnerships, S corporations and other pass-through entities (and investors in partnerships, S
corporations and other pass-through entities);
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
controlled foreign corporations and passive foreign investment companies;
brokers and dealers in stocks, securities, commodities, or currencies;
traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;
persons who acquired Xilinx common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options,
through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation;
persons who actually or constructively own more than 1% (by vote or value) of the outstanding
stock of Xilinx;
persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
persons who hold shares of Xilinx common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale,
conversion, or other integrated transaction;
accrual-method taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code;
and
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Xilinx common stock that
is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
262 • 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a corporation, or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more
“United States persons”  (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (ii) has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person for
U.S. federal income tax purposes; or
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Xilinx common
stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that
holds Xilinx common stock and any partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors regarding
the tax consequences of the merger to them.
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF
ALL OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. ALL HOLDERS OF XILINX COMMON
STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM
OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-
U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Xilinx Common Stock
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to AMD’s obligation to consummate the merger that
AMD receive an opinion from Latham & Watkins LLP, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, based on
the facts, representations, assumptions and exclusions set forth in such opinion, the merger will qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, which is referred to as the “AMD closing
tax opinion,” and a copy of the Xilinx closing tax opinion (as defined below). It is a condition to Xilinx’s
obligation to consummate the merger that Xilinx receive an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom LLP, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, based on the facts, representations, assumptions and
exclusions set forth in such opinion, the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, which is referred to as the “Xilinx closing tax opinion,” and a copy of the AMD
closing tax opinion.
The AMD closing tax opinion and the Xilinx closing tax opinion will be based on customary assumptions and
representations from AMD and Xilinx, as well as certain warranties, covenants and undertakings by AMD,
Merger Sub and Xilinx, which are collectively referred to as the “tax opinion representations and
assumptions.” If any of the tax opinion representations and assumptions or any other facts, representations,
assumptions and exclusions set forth in such opinions is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, or is violated,
the validity of the opinions described above may be affected and the tax consequences of the merger could
differ from those described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
An opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment but is not binding on the IRS or any court,
and there can be no certainty that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a
court would not sustain such a challenge. Neither AMD nor Xilinx intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with
respect to the tax consequences of the merger. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the “reorganization”
status of the merger, the tax consequences would differ materially from those described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as discussed below under “-Tax Consequences if the Merger Fails to Qualify as a
Reorganization.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Assuming that the merger qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
generally, a U.S. Holder of Xilinx common stock that exchanges their Xilinx common stock for AMD common
stock in the merger:
will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of Xilinx common stock for AMD common
stock in the merger, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common
stock (as discussed below);
will have a tax basis in the AMD common stock received in the merger (including fractional shares of
AMD common stock deemed received and exchanged for cash, as discussed below) equal to the tax
basis of the Xilinx common stock surrendered in exchange therefor; and
will have a holding period for the AMD common stock received in the merger (including fractional
shares of AMD common stock deemed received and exchanged for cash, as discussed below) that
includes its holding period for its Xilinx common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.
The AMD common stock received in the merger (including fractional shares of AMD common stock deemed
received and exchanged for cash, as discussed below) by a U.S. Holder that acquired different blocks of Xilinx
common stock at different times or at different prices will be allocated pro rata to each block of Xilinx common
stock of such U.S. Holder, and the basis and holding period of such shares of AMD common stock will be
determined using a block for block approach and will depend on the basis and holding period of each block of
Xilinx common stock exchanged for such AMD common stock.
Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares
A U.S. Holder that receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of AMD common stock in the merger will
generally be treated as having received the fractional share pursuant to the merger and then as having
exchanged such fractional share with AMD for cash, and will generally recognize capital gain or loss measured
by the difference between the cash received for such fractional share of AMD common stock and the U.S.
Holder’s tax basis in such fractional share. Such capital gain or loss will generally be long term capital gain or
loss if the holding period for such fractional share of AMD common stock is more than one year. Long term
capital gain of certain non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals, is generally taxed at preferential rates.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Tax Consequences if the Merger Fails to Qualify as a Reorganization
If the merger does not qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, a U.S.
Holder of Xilinx common stock generally would recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on
each share of Xilinx common stock surrendered in the merger in an amount equal to the difference between the
fair market value, at the time of the merger, of the AMD common stock received in the merger (including any
cash received in lieu of a fractional shares of AMD common stock) and such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the
Xilinx common stock surrendered in the merger. Gain or loss must be calculated separately for each block of
Xilinx common stock exchanged by such U.S. Holder if such blocks were acquired at different times or for
different prices. Any gain or loss recognized generally would be capital gain or loss, and generally would be
long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period in a particular block of Xilinx common stock is
more than one year at the effective time of the merger. Long-term capital gain of certain non-corporate
taxpayers, including individuals, generally is taxed at reduced U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in shares of AMD common stock received
in the merger would be equal to the fair market value thereof as of the effective time of the merger, and such
U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares would begin on the day following the merger.

AMD and Xilinx are Delaware corporations and the rights of AMD and Xilinx stockholders are governed by
the DGCL. Xilinx stockholders’ rights are also governed by the Xilinx charter and bylaws. If the merger is
completed, the rights of Xilinx stockholders who become AMD stockholders will be governed by the AMD
charter and bylaws.
As AMD and Xilinx are both Delaware corporations, the rights of AMD and Xilinx stockholders are not
materially different. However, there are certain differences in the rights of AMD stockholders under the AMD
charter and bylaws and of Xilinx stockholders under the Xilinx charter and bylaws, as summarized in the table
below. This summary does not purport to be a complete statement of all the differences, or a complete
description of the specific provisions referred to. Further, the identification of specific differences is not
intended to indicate that other equally or more significant differences do not exist. AMD and Xilinx
stockholders should carefully read the relevant provisions of the AMD charter, the AMD bylaws, the Xilinx
charter, the Xilinx bylaws and the DGCL. Copies of the documents referred to in this summary may be obtained
as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

provision shall govern and control the decision of
such question. With respect to the sale, lease or
exchange of all or substantially all of AMD’s assets,
the AMD charter requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of two-thirds of the stock issued and
outstanding and having voting power.
Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, for
all matters other than the election of directors, if a
quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority
of the shares represented and voting on the matter at
a duly held meeting is considered the act of the
stockholders so long as such shares voting
affirmatively constitute a majority of a quorum.
Distributions and Dividends
The AMD board of directors may declare dividends
at any regular or special meeting. Dividends may be
paid in cash, property or shares of stock.
After requirements related to preferential dividends
have been paid or set apart, and after AMD has
complied with all requirements for setting aside sums
as a sinking fund or for a redemption account,
holders of AMD common stock are entitled to receive
dividends declared by the AMD board of directors.

Xilinx’s President. A special meeting must also be
called by Xilinx’s Secretary upon written request of
certain stockholders (who must meet certain criteria
and request the meeting in proper form and by proper
means, all in accordance with the Xilinx bylaws).

given of any adjourned meeting if the place, date and
time of the meeting, and the means of remote

share is represented at a meeting, it will be deemed
present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the
meeting and for any adjournment thereof, unless a

must be given to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote at the adjourned meeting.
Any stockholder meeting, whether or not a quorum is
present, may be adjourned by the vote of a majority
of the shares represented at that meeting.
When a stockholder meeting is adjourned, no notice
need be given of the adjourned meeting if the time

director’s duty of loyalty, (ii) for acts or omissions
not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174
of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which

Indemnification of Directors and Officers
The AMD bylaws provide that AMD will indemnify
any person who is a party or threatened to be made a
party to any action or proceeding (other than an
action by or in the right of AMD) by reason of the
fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of
AMD, or is or was serving at the request of AMD as
a director or officer of another entity, against all
expenses, liability and loss, provided the person
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in AMD’s best interests.
Regarding any criminal action, the person must have
also had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful.
AMD is also obligated to indemnify any such person
against expenses with respect to actions or
proceedings by or in the right of AMD. However, no
indemnification will be made if the person was
adjudged to be liable to AMD, unless and only to the
extent that the relevant court determines that, despite
the adjudication of liability, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity.
The Xilinx charter and bylaws provide that Xilinx will
indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware law.
Xilinx has also entered into indemnity agreements
with certain directors and executive officers. These
agreements, among other things, indemnify Xilinx
directors and executive officers for certain expenses
(including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and
settlement payments incurred in any action in
connection with the good faith performance of their
duties as a director or officer.

Rights Upon Liquidation
Pursuant to the AMD charter, after the distribution
of all preferential amounts to be distributed to
stockholders in the event of liquidation AMD,
common stockholders are entitled to receive all of
AMD’s remaining assets available for distribution.
Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of Xilinx, common stockholders will be entitled
to participate equally and ratably, in proportion to the
number of shares held, in the net assets of Xilinx
available for distribution to common stockholders.

Certain Business Combinations
Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits a
Delaware corporation from engaging in a business
combination with an “interested stockholder” that
acquires more than 15% but less than 85% of the
corporation’s outstanding voting stock for three
years following the time that person becomes an
“interested stockholder”  (generally defined as a
holder who (i) together with its affiliates and
associates, owns or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of
the corporation and, together with that person’s
affiliates and associates, has owned at any time
within the previous three years, at least 15% of the
corporation’s outstanding shares), unless prior to
the date the person becomes an interested
stockholder, the corporation’s board of directors
approves either the business combination or the
transaction which resulted in the stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder or the business
combination is approved by the corporation’s board
of directors and by the affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds of the corporation’s outstanding voting
stock that is not owned by the interested
stockholder at a meeting of stockholders (and not by
written consent) or other specified exceptions are
met. The DGCL allows a corporation’s certificate of
incorporation to contain a provision expressly
electing not to be governed by Section 203, but the
AMD charter has not opted out of Section 203.
The DGCL permits a Delaware corporation’s
certificate of incorporation to provide for a greater
vote for a merger, consolidation or sale of
substantially all the assets of a corporation than the
vote described above. AMD’s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation requires either (i) the
affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of the
voting stock issued and outstanding having voting
power at a given stockholders’ meeting duly called or
(ii) the written consent of the holders of two-thirds of
the voting stock issued and outstanding, to sell,
lease or exchange all or substantially all of the
property and assets of AMD.

Exclusive Forum
The AMD bylaws provide that, unless AMD
consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
sole and exclusive forum for the following types of
actions or proceedings: (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of AMD; (ii) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty
owed by any current or former AMD director, officer,
employee or stockholder to AMD or its stockholders;
(iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to
any provision of the DGCL, the AMD charter or the
AMD bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers
jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware; or (iv) any action asserting a claim
governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The AMD
bylaws also provide that, unless AMD consents in
writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the U.S.
federal district courts are the exclusive forum for the
resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act. Nothing in
the AMD charter or the AMD bylaws would preclude
stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange
Act from bringing such claims in federal court to the
extent the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal
jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable
law.
See “Risk Factors-The AMD bylaws designate the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to
the extent enforceable, the U.S. federal district courts
as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes
between AMD and its stockholders, which will
restrict AMD stockholders’ ability to choose the
judicial forum for disputes with AMD or its directors,

action asserting a claim of breach of a duty (including
any fiduciary duty) owed by any current or former

agent to Xilinx or its stockholders; (iii) any action
asserting a claim arising out of or relating to any
provision of the DGCL, the Xilinx charter or the Xilinx

on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or
(iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the

the event that the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any
such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive
forum for such action or proceeding shall be another
state or federal court located within the State of
Delaware. In addition, unless Xilinx consents in

Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from certain
mergers or consolidations, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as
determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in
connection with such transaction. Under the DGCL, stockholders generally do not have appraisal rights if the
shares of stock they hold are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than
2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by the
terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the
surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that will either be listed on a national
securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares or (d) any
combination of the foregoing.
Because the merger is of Merger Sub with and into Xilinx and holders of AMD common stock will continue to
hold their shares following completion of the merger, holders of AMD common stock are not entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger.
Because AMD common stock is listed on Nasdaq, a national securities exchange, and because Xilinx
stockholders are not required by the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares of Xilinx common
stock anything other than shares of AMD common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, holders of
Xilinx common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

AMD will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2021, which is referred to as the “AMD 2021 annual
meeting,” regardless of whether the merger has been completed.
Any stockholder proposals intended to be presented at the AMD 2021 annual meeting and considered for
inclusion in AMD’s proxy materials must have been received by AMD on or before November 19, 2020. Such
proposals must have been submitted in writing to: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary,

and procedures prescribed by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act relating to stockholder proposals.
Under the AMD bylaws, nominees for director submitted by stockholders must have been received by AMD
between January 7, 2021 and February 6, 2021. Such proposals must also meet the requirements set forth in the
AMD bylaws.

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy
statements and notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a
single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” provides cost savings for companies.
AMD and Xilinx have each previously adopted householding for stockholders of record. As a result,
stockholders with the same address and last name may receive only one copy of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus from AMD or Xilinx, as applicable. Registered AMD or Xilinx stockholders (those who
hold shares directly in their name with AMD’s or Xilinx’s transfer agent) may opt out of householding and
receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending a written request to
AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, at the address below.
Some brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple
stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected
stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to
your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If,
at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to
request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.

consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof;

Company Option”) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a Parent Option on the same terms and conditions
(including applicable vesting, exercise and expiration provisions) as applied to such Assumed Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that: (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each Assumed Company Option shall be determined by multiplying: (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole share; and (ii) the per share
exercise price of each Assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing: (A) the per share exercise
price of the Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and

Parent and converted automatically into a restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock and shall otherwise remain subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions that applied to
the underlying Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that: (i) after giving any effect to
clause (ii) below, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Company RSU
Award shall be determined by multiplying: (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no
certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued.
(b) Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(b) (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock otherwise issuable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5(b)) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share
and upon surrender of such holder’s certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Company Stock Certificates”) or book-entry positions
representing non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (“Company Book-Entry Shares”) in accordance with Section 1.10, be paid in cash the dollar
amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest and subject to any required tax withholding,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the Average Parent Stock Price. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that
would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration. The payment of cash in lieu of
fractional share interests pursuant to this Section 1.8(b) is not a separately bargained-for consideration but
merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

informing Parent of any material change to the terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal, and the status of
any negotiations, including any change in its intentions as previously notified.

making such Company Change in Recommendation and/or authorizing the Company to terminate this
Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Company Acquisition
Proposal:
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements;
(ii)​ the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (the “Company Superior Proposal Notice”) no less
than four (4) Business Days in advance stating that the Company Board intends to make a Company
Change in Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with

Company Superior Proposal; and (B) after the expiration of the negotiation period described in clause (A)
above, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, and after

taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that Parent and Acquisition Sub have committed
in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (A) above, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal; provided that if there is any
change to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (ii) above and a new negotiation period under clause (A) above shall commence
(except that the original four (4) Business Day notice period referred to in clause (A) above shall instead
be equal to the longer of (1) three (3) Business Days and (2) the period remaining under the original four
(4) Business Day notice period of clause (A) above), during which time the Company shall be required to

substituting the time periods therein with the foregoing three (3) Business Day period); and
(iv) in the case of the Company terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with

Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 6.3(a).
(d)​ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may make a Company Change in Recommendation
that is not related to a Company Acquisition Proposal if and only if any state of fact, event, change, effect,
circumstance, occurrence or development, or combination thereof, arises following the date of this Agreement
(I) that (x) was neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement (or, if known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board, the consequences of which were
neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement) and (y)

Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company Superior Proposal or any inquiry or communications relating
thereto, any matter relating thereto or consequences thereof, (B) in each case in and of itself, any changes in
the market price or trading volume of Company Common Stock or the fact that the Company meets, fails to
meet or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of its revenue, earnings or other
financial performance or results of operations for any period (it being understood, however, that any
underlying cause of any of the foregoing may be taken into account unless excluded pursuant to clauses (A),
(C) or (D)), (C) any event, condition or circumstance related to Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or (D)
any changes in Legal Requirements (any such state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance, occurrence,
development, condition, circumstance, or combination thereof, being referred to as a “Company Intervening
Event”); and, prior to making such Company Change in Recommendation, (1) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that, in light of such
Company Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation would be reasonably
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements; (2) less than four (4) Business Days prior to the making of such Company Change in
Recommendation, Parent receives a written notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board
intends to effect such Company Change in Recommendation, specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable
detail; (3) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the
Company Board to effect a Company Change in Recommendation; and (4) following the end of such four (4)
Business Day period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that Parent and
Acquisition Sub have committed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (3)
above, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties
to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, even if such changes committed to in writing were to
