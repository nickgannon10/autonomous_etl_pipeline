Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Bottomline, and
Bottomline will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the
Merger, Bottomline will cease to be a publicly traded company, all outstanding shares of Bottomline stock will be canceled and converted into the right to
receive $57.00 per share in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”) (except for any shares owned by Parent or
Merger Sub or stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the “DGCL”)), and you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a
stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their
shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL, as described below under the caption “The
Merger — Appraisal Rights”).

Each restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award and stock option award that is outstanding as of the time the Merger becomes effective (the
“Effective Time”) will be provided at that time with an additional 30 months of time-based vesting credit (measured from the closing date) (the “Additional
Vesting Credit”), which includes the additional 12 months of time-based vesting credit provided under the Company’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (as
amended) in connection with a “change in control” (which will occur upon the Effective Time), unless a holder is entitled to alternative vesting provisions
under an existing award agreement or contract. In addition, any performance-based vesting conditions under restricted stock awards and restricted stock
unit awards that are outstanding as of the Effective Time will be deemed to have been achieved at the target level of performance. Additional “double-
trigger” vesting protection applies for remaining unvested awards (i.e., awards that remain unvested following application of the Additional Vesting
Credit) in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following the Effective Time.
After giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit, all vested restricted stock awards, vested restricted stock unit awards and vested stock options will
be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Bottomline
common stock subject to the award (less applicable withholding and any applicable exercise price in the case of stock options) promptly following the
Effective Time. Restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards which remain unvested as of the Effective Time (after application of the
Additional Vesting Credit) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (less applicable
withholding) multiplied by the number of shares of Bottomline stock subject to the award, which amount will be payable by the Surviving Corporation
upon vesting, subject to the holder’s continued service with the Surviving Corporation. The Additional Vesting Credit will be applied for purposes of
determining the timing of vesting and payment of the replacement cash amounts issued in respect of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit
awards that
2Table of Contents
remain unvested as of the Effective Time after the application of such Additional Vesting Credit. It is anticipated that all of the Company’s stock options
will be vested as of the Effective Time and that all of the Company’s stock options will have an exercise price less than the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder.
In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted by Bottomline’s stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at
the time, among other matters. These interests include the following:
•
the provision of the Additional Vesting Credit for unvested restricted stock awards (directors and executive officers currently do not hold
restricted stock unit awards or options), the application of “single-trigger” vesting protection for certain executive officers’ unvested
awards upon closing and the application of “double-trigger” vesting protection for remaining unvested awards in the event of a qualifying
termination of employment following the Effective Time;
•
the deemed satisfaction of any performance-based vesting conditions under applicable restricted stock awards at the target level of
performance;
•
the eligibility of certain executive officers to receive payments and benefits under employment arrangements entered into with the Company
in connection with a qualifying termination of employment following the Effective Time;
•
the possibility of continued employment of Bottomline’s officers with the Surviving Corporation that is anticipated to occur following the
Effective Time; and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time.
Philip Hilal, a director of Bottomline, is also the Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Clearfield Capital Management LP. As of January 24, 2022, Mr.
Hilal beneficially owned 935,000 shares (approximately 2.1%) of Bottomline’s common stock (which includes shares that Mr. Hilal may be deemed to
beneficially own by virtue of his positions at Clearfield Capital Management LP). As of January 24, 2022, Clearfield Capital Management LP beneficially
owned 925,000 shares (approximately 2.1%) of Bottomline’s common stock.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of common stock held by our directors and executive officers as of the Effective
Time will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of common stock held by all other stockholders. For more information, see the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Interests of Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 55 of this

If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their
shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”).
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex
5Table of Contents
C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation
that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal
rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of
another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and
in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) continuously are the
record holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and (iii) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their
shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive, in lieu of the Per Share Merger Consideration, payment in cash of the amount
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,
stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more than,
the same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Bottomline a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose
appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no
intention of doing so.
Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The Section 262 requirements for
exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If you
hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,
broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other
nominee.

Bottomline and its directors, captioned Shiva Stein v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00481 (the “Stein Complaint”). On January
21, 2022, a purported stockholder of Bottomline filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Bottomline
and its directors, captioned Jeffrey D. Justice, II v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00586 (the “Justice Complaint”). On January 26,
2022, a purported stockholder of Bottomline filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Bottomline
and its directors, captioned Chau Le v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00670 (the “Le Complaint”).
All of the complaints allege that the preliminary proxy statement issued in connection with the Merger omits material information or contains misleading
disclosures and that, as a result, (i) all of the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and (ii) all of Bottomline’s directors violated section
20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Le Complaint also alleges that Bottomline’s directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and good faith by,
among other things, causing Bottomline to enter into the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as a result of an inadequate sale process,
agreeing to preclusive deal mechanisms and filing a materially misleading and incomplete preliminary proxy statement. The Le Complaint also alleges that
Bottomline aided and abetted these purported breaches of fiduciary duties.
All of the complaints seek, among other things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (ii) rescission or rescissory damages in the event the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been implemented; (iii)
dissemination of a proxy statement that does not omit material information or contain any misleading disclosures; (iv) a declaration that defendants
violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act (except the Stein Complaint and the Le Complaint) or that Bottomline’s directors violated their
fiduciary duties (except the Stein Complaint and the Justice Complaint); (v) to direct the defendants to account to plaintiff for all damages suffered (except
the Justice Complaint); and (vi) an award of plaintiff’s expenses, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees.
Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub believe the claims asserted in each of the complaints are without merit.
Additional lawsuits may be filed against Bottomline, the Board of Directors, Parent and/or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement and the Proxy Statement.

are each responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.
Bottomline will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $78,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. In
addition, in certain circumstances, Bottomline will be required to reimburse Parent for up to $5,000,000 of its expenses associated with the transactions

A special meeting of stockholders of Bottomline (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on March 8, 2022, at 4 p.m., Eastern Time, at 325 Corporate Drive,
Portsmouth, NH 03801.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the close of business on February 1, 2022 (the “Record Date”).
You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of common stock that you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
Purpose
At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the Merger Agreement; (2) adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date
or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 44,977,553 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The holders of a majority
in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at
the Special Meeting.
10Table of Contents
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bottomline common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in
person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of
compensation that will or may become payable to Bottomline’s executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on the subject matter.
Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers; Voting Agreement
As of January 24, 2022, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 2,102,381 shares of common
stock, representing approximately 4.7% of the shares of common stock outstanding on January 24, 2022.
Parent and Bottomline have entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with our directors (including our chief executive officer) and
Clearfield Capital Management LP (collectively, the “Supporting Shareholders”), which collectively hold approximately 4% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock, as of the date of the Voting Agreement. A copy of the Voting Agreement is attached as Annex D and is incorporated herein by
reference. Under the Voting Agreement, the Supporting Shareholders agree, among other things, during the term of the Voting Agreement, to vote their
shares of common stock (i) in favor of the adoption of Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) against any
alternative acquisition proposal, and not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, exchange or otherwise dispose of their shares, subject to certain limited
exceptions.
We currently expect that our directors and executive officers will vote all of their respective shares of Bottomline common stock: (1) “FOR” the adoption
of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Voting and Proxies
Any stockholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or
granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or may vote in person by appearing at the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner
and hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock
exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting
are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important
that you cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by (1) signing
another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the Special Meeting; (2) submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or (4) attending the Special
Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?

postponement thereof). Each holder of shares of Bottomline common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the Special
Meeting for each share of common stock owned as of the Record Date.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A: Yes. All stockholders as of the Record Date may attend the Special Meeting and vote in person. Seating will be limited. Stockholders will need to
present proof of ownership of shares of Bottomline common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification
to be admitted to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the
Special Meeting. Due to health and safety considerations related to COVID-19, in-person attendance will require compliance with any then-applicable
governmental requirements or recommendations as well as with facility requirements.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special Meeting we encourage you to sign,
date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.

from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
Is it possible that the Special Meeting will be changed to a virtual format?
A: Although we are currently planning to hold the Special Meeting in person, in light of the ongoing public health concerns surrounding the COVID-19
pandemic, we are planning for the possibility that the Special Meeting may be held solely by means of remote communication (i.e., a virtual-only meeting)
in lieu of an in-person meeting. If we decide to hold a virtual Special Meeting, we will publicly announce the decision in advance in a press release, and
details on how to access the virtual Special Meeting will be posted on our website at www.investors.bottomline.com as soon as practicable before the
Special Meeting and filed as additional proxy soliciting material with the SEC. In that event, the Special Meeting will be held on the above date and time
but would be available via live video webcast. We recommend that you monitor our website for updated information, and please check the website in
advance of the Special Meeting to confirm the status of the Special Meeting before planning to attend in person.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Bottomline?
A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Bottomline by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by Bottomline’s
stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Bottomline, with Bottomline continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Bottomline will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered
under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Bottomline common stock that
you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of common
stock, you will receive $5,700.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the Per Share Merger Consideration compare to the market price of the common stock?
A: The $57.00 Per Share Merger Consideration constituted a premium of: (1) approximately 41% and 40% to the unaffected 30-day and 60-day
(respectively) volume weighted average price of Bottomline’s common stock prior to October 19, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of
the appointment of Michael Curran, Philip Hilal and Larry Klane to the Board of Directors; and (2) approximately 13% to the closing price of Bottomline’s
common stock on December 15, 2021, the last trading day prior to the date on which Bottomline entered into the Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement
carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you
wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
14
Table of Contents
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A: No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your Bottomline stock certificates to
the paying agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common stock represented by your stock certificates. You should use
the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with
your proxy card.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell
or transfer your shares of Bottomline common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Bottomline in
writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person
to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer
your shares of common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
Q:
How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
A: The Board of Directors, after considering the various factors described under the caption “The Merger — Recommendation of the Board of Directors
and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement; (2) declared that it is in the best interests of Bottomline and its stockholders that Bottomline enter into the merger agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement; and (3) declared that the terms of the merger agreement are fair to Bottomline and its stockholders. The Board of Directors unanimously
recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)
“FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Bottomline’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not
receive any payment for their shares of Bottomline common stock. Instead, Bottomline will remain an independent public company, our common stock will
continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Bottomline will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $78,000,000 upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances,
as described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursement,” beginning on page 98 of this proxy
statement.
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bottomline common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. If
a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet
or by telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal
15
Table of Contents
to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a
quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation
that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present
in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of
compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter. The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (3) vote in
person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal
and the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers
in connection with the Merger. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adjournment proposal and the proposal to approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A: SEC rules require Bottomline to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger for
purposes of this advisory vote?
A: The compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is described more
fully under the heading “Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers
in connection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?
A: Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is not a
condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Bottomline or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is adopted by the
stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger will or may be paid to Bottomline’s named executive officers pursuant to the terms of the applicable arrangement even if stockholders fail
to approve such compensation.

Table of Contents
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Bottomline.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common stock held in “street
name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those
shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares
by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record,
you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
How may I vote?
A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Bottomline common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot. A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your
identity and allow you to vote your shares of Bottomline common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly
recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your
shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for
which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Bottomline common stock by proxy. If you
are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Bottomline common stock
in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by
ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you
should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting
only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee
to vote of your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against
adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Table of Contents
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot. If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should
contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the
Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock. The written document describing
the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your
shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” Our Board of Directors has designated Joseph L. Mullen, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Robert
A. Eberle, our Chief Executive Officer, A. Bruce Bowden, our Chief Financial Officer, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as the proxy
holders for the Special Meeting.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or
telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none
of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your
shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation
that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction
cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage
account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than
one proxy card. Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting instruction
card that you receive.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A: If available, Bottomline may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. Bottomline intends to publish final voting
results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that Bottomline files with the SEC are publicly
available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.” beginning on page 105 of this proxy
statement.

Table of Contents
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of
Bottomline common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you received pursuant to the Merger and your adjusted tax basis in the shares of
common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Bottomline common stock for cash
in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.
You should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in light of your own particular
circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of certain U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under the caption “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
What will the holders of Bottomline stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards receive in the Merger?
A: At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option, restricted stock award and restricted stock unit award will be credited with the Additional
Vesting Credit. For any award of restricted shares or restricted stock units that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the number of shares
subject to such award will be deemed to have been achieved at the “target” level of performance for such award at the Effective Time.
After giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit, each outstanding option that is vested will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash (subject to any applicable tax withholding) equal to the product of (1) the amount, if any, by which $57.00 exceeds the exercise price per
share of Bottomline common stock underlying such stock option; and (2) the total number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such option.
It is anticipated that all outstanding stock options will be fully vested and “in-the-money” at the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award that is then vested (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit) will be converted into the right
to receive the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such restricted stock award, payable promptly
following the Effective Time. Each restricted stock award which is unvested as of the Effective Time (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit)
will be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of
shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such unvested restricted stock award, which amount will, generally subject to the holder’s continued
service with the Company, Parent or an affiliate through the applicable vesting date and vest and be payable at the same time and on the same terms as
the unvested restricted stock award to which such cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (except that any applicable performance
conditions will be deemed to have been achieved at target levels and after giving effect to Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline’s
2019 Stock Incentive Plan, if the holder’s employment is terminated other than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective
Time, the cash amount to which such restricted stock award relates will immediately vest.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award that is then vested (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit) will be
converted into the right to receive a payment equal to the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such

converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) $57.00 and (2) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject
to such unvested restricted stock award, which amount will, generally subject to the holder’s continued service with the Company, Parent or an affiliate
through the applicable vesting date and vest and be payable at the same time and on the same terms as the unvested restricted stock unit award to which
such cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (except that any applicable performance conditions will be deemed to have been
achieved at target levels and after giving effect to Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, if the holder’s
employment is terminated other than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective Time, the cash amount to which such
restricted stock unit award relates will immediately vest.
Q:
What will happen to the Bottomline Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) in connection with the Merger?
A: The current purchase period under the ESPP will be the final purchase period under the ESPP; to the extent necessary, the current purchase period will
be shortened so that the share purchase pursuant to that purchase period will occur prior to the Merger. Any funds remaining in a participant’s account
following this final purchase will be refunded to the participant. Shares purchased via the ESPP will be treated in the same manner as other outstanding
Bottomline shares in the Merger. There will be no increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP during the current
purchase period and no new participants will be allowed to enroll in the ESPP.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the second calendar quarter of
2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A: If the Merger is completed, Bottomline stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that stockholders are entitled to
have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262. Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, Bottomline stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this
proxy statement, and Section 262 regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement.
Q:
Do any of Bottomline’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Bottomline stockholders generally?
A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Bottomline
stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii)
recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Bottomline’s stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests
to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger —
Interests of Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 55 of this proxy statement.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",20,29
BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES INC_20220202_DEFM14A_19817567_4374090.Pdf,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement and any document referred to in this proxy statement contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal
securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
These forward-looking statements are based on Bottomline’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the
proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, its business and industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by Bottomline
and Thoma Bravo, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial
performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,”
“may,” “would,” “might,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “expect,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other
comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that
involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the
consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to
consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are
not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying
on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed
transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining stockholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities,
future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects,
business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Bottomline’s business and other conditions to the completion of the
transaction; (ii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bottomline’s business and general economic conditions; (iii) Bottomline’s ability to implement
its business strategy; (iv) significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction; (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed
transaction; (vi) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Bottomline’s business, including current plans and operations; (vii) the
ability of Bottomline to retain and hire key personnel; (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the
announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (ix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Bottomline’s business; (x)
general economic and market developments and conditions; (xi) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Bottomline operates; (xii)
potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect Bottomline’s
financial performance; (xiii) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Bottomline’s ability to pursue certain business
opportunities or strategic transactions; and (xiv) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or
outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Bottomline’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with
the proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in this proxy statement. While the list of factors presented here, and the list of factors presented in
this proxy statement are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in
results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational
problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Bottomline’s financial
condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Bottomline does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by
securities and other applicable laws.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bottomline common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Bottomline’s stockholders is a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in
person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of
compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement. For stockholders who attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if
the stockholder voted “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Bottomline does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide
brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special
Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Bottomline common stock at the Special Meeting
without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their
shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that stockholders are entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive in lieu of the Per Share Merger Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the
court, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to
seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more
than, the same as or less than the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Bottomline a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose
appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no
intention of doing so.
Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for
exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal Rights,” of this proxy statement, and Section
262, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares
of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other
nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, broker or nominee.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including
proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other
things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption
of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a
vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that
we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or
may become payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section captioned “The Merger —
Interests of Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 55 of this proxy statement.
We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various items of compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of Bottomline’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger— Golden Parachute Compensation,” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement, and the
accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously
formed part of Bottomline’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Bottomline Technologies, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Bottomline to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger— Golden Parachute
Compensation.”
Stockholders should note that the approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will not be
binding on Bottomline, the Board of Directors, Parent or the named executive officers. Further, certain payments under the underlying plans and
arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory
vote, if the Merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying plans and agreements and the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES INC_20220202_DEFM14A_19817567_4374090.Pdf,Effect of the Merger,"Effect of the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Bottomline, and
Bottomline will continue as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, our common stock will no
longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as we,
Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).
Effect on Bottomline if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Bottomline’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not
receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Bottomline will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the
Merger is not completed, we expect that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject,
including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Bottomline operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our common
stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at which it
trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares
of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Bottomline’s business operations, strategic
direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by
Bottomline’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the
Board of Directors will be offered or that Bottomline’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.
Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Bottomline will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $78,000,000. In
addition, in certain circumstances, Bottomline will be required to reimburse Parent for up to $5,000,000 of its expenses associated with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (with such reimbursement deducted from the termination fee, should it not be payable at the time of such
termination but subsequently become payable). For more information please see the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees and
Expense Reimbursement,” beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement.

In the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares owned by (1) Parent or Merger Sub and (2) stockholders who are entitled to

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. This chronology does not purport
to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the Board of Directors, Thoma Bravo, the Company’s representatives, Thoma Bravo’s
representatives, and other parties. Other than as described below, there have been no material contacts between the Company and Thoma Bravo in the
past two years.
As part of its ongoing evaluation of Bottomline’s business, the Board of Directors, together with senior management, regularly reviews and assesses
Bottomline’s strategic direction, financial performance and business plans with a view towards strengthening Bottomline’s business and identifying
opportunities to increase stockholder value. Representatives of private equity firms and potential strategic partners have from time to time contacted
and/or met with members of Company management to discuss the Company’s business, with a view to exploring whether to pursue a potential
transaction with the Company.
On February 5, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party D”) contacted Robert Eberle, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, seeking to
receive an update on the Company’s business. This representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of
the Company. As further described below, Mr. Eberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party D during the period
leading up to Party D’s submission of a written expression of interest with respect to a transaction involving the Company.
On April 6, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party E”) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company’s business. This
representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.
Eberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party E during the period leading up to mid-September 2021, but when
Party E learned that the Company would be undertaking a process to solicit interest from potential acquirors, Party E indicated it did not intend to
participate in the process.
On April 13, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party B”) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company’s business.
This representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.
Eberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party B during the period leading up to the Company’s entry into an
exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo on December 9, 2021.
In light of the various expressions of interest described above, Mr. Eberle contacted representatives of Deutsche Bank, whose lead representative had a
long-standing relationship with the Company and familiarity with the Company’s business, and requested a meeting, which meeting occurred on April 16,
2021. During this meeting, Mr. Eberle and Bruce Bowden, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, discussed Deutsche Bank’s perspectives, based on
public information, concerning a range of potential strategic alternatives for the Company and market perspectives of the Company.
On April 26, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party F”) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company’s business.
This representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.
Eberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party F during the period leading up to early December 2021, including
submitting a written expression of interest as described below.
On May 4, 2021, the Company publicly announced earnings for its 2021 third fiscal quarter and provided guidance for the upcoming 2022 fiscal year. The
Company’s financial performance had met Wall Street consensus revenue and earnings targets and the Company’s publicly disclosed guidance for the
2021 third fiscal
33Table of Contents
quarter. However, the Company’s 2022 fiscal year guidance reflected the Company’s expectation of focusing on growth investments and accelerating
subscription revenue growth, and as a consequence reflected anticipated earnings that were lower than Wall Street consensus for the 2022 fiscal year.
The Company’s stock price traded down by more than 20% within the two trading days after this announcement.
On May 11, 2021, the Board of Directors met to discuss perspectives on the Company’s strategic plan in light of the negative market reaction following
the Company’s announcement of its 2021 third fiscal quarter results and 2022 fiscal year guidance. The Board of Directors discussed the potential
opportunities and challenges faced by the Company in seeking to execute on its long-term business plans, including that the Company’s ability to invest
in growth opportunities was constrained by stockholder focus on near-term profitability, affecting both investment in product development as well as
sales and marketing and go-to-market activities for existing products, and that this could create disadvantages over the longer term relative to
competitors with public or private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings. The Board of Directors also discussed the Company’s past
success in using acquisitions to enhance its product offerings and market scope as new technologies and opportunities emerged, and the fact that it had
become more difficult to execute successful acquisitions given the increased valuations of potentially attractive targets and the constraints on the
Company’s ability to invest in acquisitions relative to competitors with public or private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings, and that
the Board of Directors and the Company’s senior management expected this challenge to persist. In addition, the Board of Directors discussed concerns
relative to attracting and retaining key, experienced talent at various levels of the Company’s business, and the fact that these concerns could worsen in
the future given both the constraints on the Company’s ability to offer competitive compensation relative to some competitors with public or private
market valuations based on growth rather than earnings and the negative impact of the Company’s recent stock price decline on employee incentives.
Following discussion of these matters, the Board of Directors discussed a variety of potential strategic alternatives in addition to continuing to seek to
execute on the Company’s long-term business plans, including the possibility of a spin-off or divestiture of one or more business units and the
possibility of a sale of the Company to either a strategic or a financial buyer. The Board of Directors discussed the Company’s recent interactions with
private equity firms (which interactions had been discussed informally with various members of the Board of Directors prior to May 11, 2021). The Board
of Directors discussed the risk that exploring potential strategic and financial buyer interest in a transaction, in particular through a process with broad
outreach, could become publicly known and negatively impact new bookings, customer relationships and the Company’s ability to attract and retain key
talent. Following discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Mr. Eberle to work with necessary members of Company management and Deutsche Bank
to implement a process to confidentially solicit indications of interest, based on publicly available information, from leading private equity firms viewed as
best positioned to offer the highest value for the Company, to enable the Board of Directors to consider feedback and further evaluate whether or not to
pursue a potential sale or marketing process (as opposed to continuing to execute the Company’s long-term business plans or pursuing other strategic
alternatives) and whether or not to contact additional potential financial buyers or strategic buyers. No decision was made to pursue a sale or marketing
process at that time.
On May 17, 2021, Mr. Eberle and Mr. Bowden met with representatives of Deutsche Bank and further discussed potential strategic alternatives, including
a process for outreach to a select number of private equity firms, consistent with Mr. Eberle’s discussion with the Board of Directors on May 11, 2021, to
explore a sale of the Company and the possibility of outreach to additional parties depending on initial feedback.
On June 7, 2021, Brian Jaffee of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Eberle seeking to receive an update on the Company’s business. Mr. Jaffee subsequently
expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company, but no specific acquisition proposal was discussed.
On June 9, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party C”) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company’s business. This
representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in
34

exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr. Eberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic
discussions with Party C during the period leading up to early December 2021.
On June 17, 2021, Mr. Bowden met with a representative of a private equity firm (“Party G”) at the representative’s request at an investor conference.
Thereafter, on July 6, 2021, a representative of Party G contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to better understand the Company’s business.
On July 16, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party H”) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company’s business. This
representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr.
Eberle and other Company representatives engaged in periodic discussions with Party H during the period leading up to mid-October 2021.
On August 25, 2021, Mr. Eberle and Mr. Bowden had a meeting with representatives of Party G who expressed an interest in exploring a potential
acquisition of the Company. As further described below, Mr. Eberle and other Company and Deutsche Bank representatives engaged in periodic
discussions with Party G during the period leading up to early December 2021.
On September 1, 2021, Mr. Eberle had a meeting with the CEO of a potential strategic partner (“Party A”). This meeting was scheduled at the request of
Party A’s CEO. At the meeting, Party A’s CEO expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential strategic combination with the Company. Later
that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of the Company’s
outside corporate counsel at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (“WilmerHale”), for the purpose of updating the Board of Directors on Mr.
Eberle’s meeting with the CEO of Party A. Mr. Eberle reported that the CEO of Party A had expressed interest in exploring the possibility of a strategic
transaction between the Company and Party A, but had not made a specific proposal or provided any indication of the terms of such a transaction.
On September 9, 2021, the CEO of Party A contacted Mr. Eberle, inquiring again whether the Company would be interested in discussing a potential
strategic transaction with Party A. The CEO of Party A indicated to Mr. Eberle that the CEO had not discussed a potential transaction with his board, or
received authority from his board to make an offer, and that Party A had not engaged a financial advisor for such a transaction, but that the CEO believed
such a transaction could be priced at $52.00 per share and could consist of a combination of cash and stock consideration with a significant component
of stock. The CEO of Party A noted that he was not yet prepared to identify the source of any financing for the cash component of the consideration and
would require approximately two months before he would be able to do so.
On September 10, 2021, Mr. Jaffee from Thoma Bravo and Mr. Eberle had a telephone conversation regarding Mr. Jaffee’s interest in receiving an update
on the Company’s business. No specific acquisition proposal was discussed at the time.
On September 10, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s senior management, representatives of WilmerHale
and representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the Company’s outside counsel for strategic matters (“Skadden”). Mr. Eberle reported
to the Board of Directors regarding outreach he had received the prior day from the CEO of Party A, including the lack of board or financial advisor
involvement by Party A at this stage, the proposed valuation, and the mix of consideration. Mr. Eberle also noted that the Company had received
outreach from several potential private equity acquirors looking to engage in discussions with the Company. After discussion, the Board of Directors
determined that it would not be in the Company’s best interest at this time to engage in further discussion with Party A given the speculative nature of
Party A’s outreach and concerns raised by the Board of Directors, including with respect to the ability of Company A to finance the cash consideration
and the prospects of Company A, but acknowledged that it may be appropriate at a later date to discuss a more concrete proposal. Accordingly, the
Board of Directors agreed that Mr. Eberle would communicate that message to the CEO of Party A.

Mr. Eberle then updated the Board of Directors on outreach he had received on September 8, 2021, from representatives of Sachem Head Capital
Management LP (“Sachem Head”), which indicated that it was working with Clearfield Capital Management LP (“Clearfield”) and that together, they held
approximately 4% of the Company’s outstanding shares beneficially, and 8% economically. The Board of Directors discussed this outreach with
representatives of Skadden, and determined that it was advisable for Mr. Eberle to engage in further discussion with Sachem Head and Clearfield.
On September 13, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of
Skadden and WilmerHale. Mr. Eberle reported on a call that he and Mr. Bowden had with representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield that day, during
which those representatives requested that the Company agree to accept director nominations from Sachem Head and Clearfield for up to one month after
the current director nomination deadline to allow for further discussions with the Company. The representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield had
indicated that they believed the Company was undervalued, explained their views on the factors causing the undervaluation, and suggested that Mr.
Hilal, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Clearfield, chair a newly formed special committee of the Board of Directors to evaluate alternatives for
accelerating growth and enhancing stockholder value. The representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield also indicated their desire to put forward two
nominees to the Board of Directors, proposed that the Company declassify the Board of Directors, requested that the nomination deadline be extended to
allow for further discussion to achieve a settlement, and indicated that if the deadline were not extended, they were prepared to submit a nomination for
two directors and proceed with a proxy contest. The Board of Directors discussed the various potential outcomes of an activist campaign and the risks to
the Company of such a process. The Board of Directors recommended that Mr. Eberle continue discussions with Sachem Head and Clearfield to see if a
mutually agreeable resolution would be possible. The Board of Directors also discussed the recent inbound interest in a strategic transaction for the
Company detailed above, and authorized Company management to engage in discussions with Deutsche Bank with respect to formalizing its relationship
with the Company.
Between September 13, 2021 and September 23, 2021, discussions continued between Mr. Eberle (acting in consultation with Joseph Mullen, Chairperson
of the Board of Directors) and representatives of Sachem Head and Clearfield, as well as between representatives of Skadden and representatives of
Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP (“SRZ”), counsel to Sachem Head and Clearfield.
On September 23, 2021, an executive session of the Board of Directors was held, with members of the Company’s senior management and representatives
of Skadden and WilmerHale attending. At the executive session, the Board of Directors discussed whether to engage Deutsche Bank as a financial
advisor to the Company in connection with a potential evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Company. The Board of Directors discussed Deutsche
Bank’s industry knowledge and expertise, and familiarity with the Company, and the fact that the lead representative of Deutsche Bank had a long-
standing working relationship with the Company. After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to engage Deutsche Bank as financial
advisor to the Company. After representatives of Deutsche Bank joined the meeting, representatives of Skadden described the current status of
settlement discussions with Sachem Head and Clearfield. After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Company management to respond to the
proposed settlement with Sachem Head and Clearfield.
Later on September 23, 2021, a representative of Deutsche Bank contacted a representative of a potential strategic buyer to assess its interest in exploring
a strategic transaction with the Company. This representative did not express interest in further evaluating a potential transaction.
On October 2, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm (“Party I”) contacted Mr. Eberle, seeking to receive an update on the Company’s business.
This representative subsequently expressed to Mr. Eberle an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company, but noted that Party I would
need to determine its equity commitment sources and that if an auction were to occur, Party I would not likely be the highest bidder. Mr. Eberle and
representatives of Deutsche Bank engaged in periodic discussions with Party I during the period leading up to late October 2021.

On October 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Skadden
and WilmerHale. The Board of Directors discussed a revised settlement proposal from Sachem Head and Clearfield, and authorized Company management
to respond to the revised proposed settlement and agree to, among other things, the appointment of three new directors to the Board of Directors, the
formation of a new Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors, a one-year standstill, and declassification of the Board of Directors in 2022.
During early October 2021, a representative of the Company and/or a representative of Deutsche Bank conveyed to Thoma Bravo, Party B, Party C, Party
D, Party E, Party G, Party H and Party I that if these parties wished to further pursue a transaction with the Company and obtain access to non-public
information, they should submit to Deutsche Bank in the near term a written indication of interest with a proposed valuation for the Company, their
proposed due diligence requests and a summary of their proposed material terms for a potential acquisition of the Company. Party F was not contacted at
this time as the Company believed that Party F was unlikely to engage at this time due to their lack of engagement and interest in recent months.
On October 12, 2021, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee (the “NCGC”) of the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by
members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Skadden and WilmerHale. Conditioned upon the execution of a settlement
agreement with Sachem Head and Clearfield, the NCGC recommended that the Board of Directors appoint three new directors to the Board of Directors,
appoint one of the new directors to the NCGC, appoint one of the new directors to the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors, and form a Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of two of the new directors and four other directors.
On October 19, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, attended by members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Skadden
and WilmerHale. The Board of Directors considered and approved the final terms of the proposed settlement with Sachem Head and Clearfield, including
the proposed appointment of three new directors to the Board of Directors and the formation of a new Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors.
Also on October 19, 2021, a representative of Party G informed Mr. Eberle that Party G was working on a written indication of interest with support from
its investment committee and expressed confidence in Party G’s ability to enter into a definitive agreement for a transaction within three weeks. On
October 20, 2021, the Company issued a press release announcing that, following engagement with stockholders Sachem Head and Clearfield, it had
agreed to appoint three new directors to the Board of Directors, effective November 8, 2021. In addition, the Company announced that the Board of
Directors had formed a new Strategy Committee responsible for evaluating and making recommendations with respect to the Company’s market position
and strategy, acceleration of subscription revenue growth and opportunities to create additional stockholder value. The Company’s stock price traded up
by more than 15% within the two trading days after this announcement.
Between October 19 and October 26, 2021, three private equity firms (Thoma Bravo, Party B and Party C), submitted initial written indications of interest
with proposed price ranges. Thoma Bravo’s indication of interest, received on October 22, 2021, proposed an acquisition of the Company in the range of
$52.00 to $55.00 per share. Party B proposed an acquisition of the Company in a range of $50.00 to $55.00 per share, and Party C proposed a range of
$50.00 to $52.00 per share. In addition, two other private equity firms (Party D and Party I) submitted written expressions of interest during this period,
with no specific proposed valuation. None of these parties were provided non-public information by the Company in order to formulate these indications
or expressions of interest.
On October 26, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,
Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Mr. Eberle updated the Board of Directors on inbound inquiries that the Company had received expressing
interest in exploring a strategic transaction with the Company, including with respect to the five private equity firms (Thoma Bravo,
37
Table of Contents
Party B, Party C, Party D and Party I) that had submitted written indications or expressions of interest. Mr. Eberle noted that four other private equity
firms that had initially expressed interest in a transaction with the Company had not submitted written indications of interest (Party E, Party F, Party G and
Party H), one strategic party (Party A) that had originally expressed interest had not been invited to submit a written indication of interest, another
strategic party that was not Party A had responded to outreach from Deutsche Bank on October 22, 2021, indicating that its interest did not include an
acquisition of the entire Company, and a third strategic party had responded to outreach from Deutsche Bank indicating that it was not interested in
engaging with the Company due to lack of a strategic fit. The Board of Directors also discussed the Company’s current five-year financial model for the
Company and opportunities and challenges facing the Company in the coming years. After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Company
management to enter into non-disclosure agreements (“NDAs”) with four of the five private equity firms (Thoma Bravo, Party B, Party C and Party D) that
had submitted written indications or expressions of interest, and to provide non-public information to such firms. The Board of Directors determined that
the Company should terminate discussions with the fifth private equity firm (Party I) based on its belief that any potential offer from Party I would require
validating sources of funds including third party equity commitments. The Board of Directors authorized Deutsche Bank to make additional outreach to
certain specified strategic parties and additional private equity firms, which were selected by Deutsche Bank based on its knowledge of the Company and
the markets in which it operates, and seek to determine their level of interest in a potential transaction with the Company. The Board of Directors also
determined not to pursue further discussions with the four private equity firms that had not submitted written indications of interest (Party E, Party F,
Party G and Party H) and Party A for several reasons, including the valuation proposed, the uncertainty as to the source of the cash component of Party
A’s original proposal, and the uncertainty created by the likely need for a vote by Party A’s stockholders.
Following the October 26, 2021 meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives of Deutsche Bank contacted five additional strategic parties and three
additional private equity firms consistent with discussion with the Board of Directors.
Between November 8, 2021 and December 4, 2021, the Company executed NDAs with seven private equity firms consistent with discussions with the
Board of Directors, including the four private equity firms that had submitted written indications or expressions of interest and were discussed with the
Board of Directors on October 26, 2021 (this included Thoma Bravo, which entered into an NDA on November 11, 2021, and Party B, which entered into an
NDA on November 8, 2021, Party D, which entered into an NDA on November 10, 2021, and Party F, which entered into an NDA on December 4, 2021). All
seven of the NDAs included standstill provisions which would automatically terminate upon announcement by the Company of an acquisition
transaction. None of the strategic parties with whom the Company or its representatives had contact (whether before or after the October 26, 2021
meeting of the Board of Directors) entered into an NDA with the Company and, except for the discussions with Party A described above, all of these
strategic parties either expressed a lack of interest in pursuing an acquisition of the Company or failed to respond following outreach.
Beginning on November 15, 2021, management conducted management presentations with each of the seven private equity firms that had entered into
NDAs with the Company. Six of the seven firms were then given access to a virtual data room that had been established by the Company to facilitate due
diligence. The seventh firm declined data room access.
On November 17, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,
Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Representatives of Skadden reviewed the role of the Board of Directors in a potential sale transaction and
discussed related legal considerations. Company management reviewed with the Board of Directors the Company’s five-year financial model that would
be provided to potential acquirors and used for purposes of financial analyses to be conducted by Deutsche Bank, which management noted was a more
detailed version of the model discussed at the meeting of the Board of Directors on October 26, 2021. This financial model is identical, other than
immaterial differences, to the projections included at “ —Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 53. Mr. Eberle updated the Board of Directors
on management presentations that had been given that week and upcoming
38
Table of Contents
scheduled presentations. Representatives of Deutsche Bank summarized the results of their outreach to strategic parties, indicating that Deutsche Bank
had contacted seven additional potential strategic acquirors of the Company and that none had expressed interest in entering into an NDA in order to
receive non-public information concerning the Company.
During the latter part of November 2021 and early December 2021, several private equity firms contacted Deutsche Bank inquiring whether the Company
was considering a sale process. Deutsche Bank did not confirm that the Company was engaged in a sale process or invite participation in a process by
these private equity firms, and these private equity firms made no further efforts to engage Deutsche Bank or the Company.
On November 29, 2021, a draft of the merger agreement was uploaded to the data room for all bidders to review, and instructions were provided for a
markup to be included with bids due on December 6, 2021. This initial draft proposed a go-shop period and lower termination fee for parties identified
during the go-shop period. This initial draft did not include a financing contingency; however, given the expectation that bidders (all of whom were then
anticipated to be private equity firms) would seek debt financing, this initial draft proposed that the Company’s ability to obtain specific performance to
consummate the Merger would be contingent on the availability of a bidder’s debt financing and that if specific performance were not available, the
Company’s recourse would be limited to a reverse termination fee. In addition, the draft proposed full acceleration of all Company equity awards at
closing. The instructions for the bids due on December 6, 2021 referred bidders to capitalization assumptions contained in the virtual data room, which
capitalization assumptions included fully diluted capitalization of approximately 47.4 million shares as of September 30, 2021 and described additional
shares to be issued in the ordinary course of business prior to the closing pursuant to equity awards to certain recent or prospective new employees and
under the second tranche of the Company’s fiscal year 2022 equity awards to non-named executive officer employees.
On December 2, 2021, Party F submitted a written expression of interest addressed to the Company CEO and the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
indicating its interest in participating in the process with respect to a potential transaction. The expression of interest did not include a specific proposed
valuation. Party F entered into an NDA with the Company on December 4, 2021 and subsequently received a management presentation from the
Company, access to the data room and the draft merger agreement on December 6, 2021. However, Party F did not make a further proposal to acquire the
Company. Also on December 2, 2021, a representative of Party G informed Mr. Eberle that it was no longer interested in making a proposal to acquire the
Company given the increase in the Company’s stock price following the Company’s announcement of the formation of the Strategy Committee. A
representative of Party G subsequently sent an email to Mr. Eberle on December 8, 2021 confirming that Party G would not be making a proposal to
acquire the Company on the timeline suggested by the Company but would seek to line up the necessary resources and approvals to further engage after
the holidays.
On December 7, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted an updated written indication of interest, with a per share value of $56.50. Thoma Bravo requested
exclusivity for a seven-day period to negotiate a transaction. Thoma Bravo also provided an equity commitment letter from Thoma Bravo Fund XV, L.P.
covering 100% of the consideration payable in the Merger, and a markup of the draft merger agreement, which markup proposed the following material
revisions: eliminating the go-shop period and lower termination fee for parties identified during the go-shop period, adding a quantitative threshold for
the accuracy of the Company’s capitalization representations as a condition to closing, eliminating the requirement that debt financing be available in
order for the Company to obtain specific performance to consummate the Merger (subject to the satisfaction of other conditions) and eliminating a
reverse termination fee, adding a cap on post-termination damages, adding expense reimbursement by the Company in the event of a termination in which
a termination fee could in the future become payable by the Company, expanding Thoma Bravo’s termination rights and the circumstances triggering
payment of a termination fee by the Company, and eliminating acceleration of Company equity awards (other than as provided by existing plans and
award agreements) such that unvested awards would be converted into time-based cash awards with their existing vesting schedule; and including
certain modifications to the overall
39
Table of Contents
suite of representations, warranties and covenants to be provided by each party under the merger agreement. This indication of interest assumed fully
diluted capitalization of the Company no greater than approximately 47.4 million shares.
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,
Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance, as well as a representative from the Company’s strategic communications advisor, Joele Frank. Representatives of
Deutsche Bank updated the Board of Directors on the updated proposal submitted by Thoma Bravo, indicated that an updated proposal was expected
from Party B soon, noted that the remaining private equity firms that had received presentations and due diligence material had indicated that they were
not interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company (and the reasons conveyed by those entities, which included concerns about future organic
growth opportunities, focusing on other transactions, and investment theses being challenged through diligence), and noted that no serious interest had
been expressed by the strategic companies to which Deutsche Bank had initiated outreach. The Board of Directors discussed the proposal from Thoma
Bravo and directed Deutsche Bank to inform Thoma Bravo that the Company would respond after the Board of Directors’ meeting to be held the
following day. The Board of Directors also considered and approved the Company’s five-year financial model that had been reviewed with the Board of
Directors at the November 17 meeting. This financial model is identical, other than immaterial differences, to the projections included at “ —Certain
Financial Projections” beginning on page 53.
On December 8, 2021, representatives of Deutsche Bank and Party B held a phone conversation whereby Party B continued to indicate its interest in
acquiring the Company but expressed the necessity to continue its due diligence into January 2022.
Later on December 8, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche
Bank, Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Representatives of Deutsche Bank updated the Board of Directors on discussions with Party B, its
continued interest in the Company and the additional time that Party B had requested to conduct further diligence before submitting an updated written
proposal. Representatives of Deutsche Bank also presented an analysis of Thoma Bravo’s bid, and representatives of Skadden described generally the
status of the merger agreement negotiations. The Board of Directors instructed the representatives of Deutsche Bank to request Thoma Bravo to increase
its bid and express willingness to work to finalize negotiations on the timeframe proposed by Thoma Bravo if such an increase were acceptable to the
Board of Directors, but to resist exclusivity in light of ongoing discussions with Party B.
On December 9, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted an updated written offer, described as its “best and final” offer, of $57.00 per share, which was also
conditioned on a seven-day exclusivity period (which would automatically extend for an additional seven days unless terminated by either party at the
end of the initial period).
Later on December 9, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche
Bank, Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Representatives of Deutsche Bank described the updated bid from Thoma Bravo and the communication
regarding Thoma Bravo’s bid and eagerness to finalize the transaction. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal considerations pertaining to the Board
of Directors’ consideration of a sale of the Company, and the Board of Directors discussed the opportunities, risks and challenges of remaining an
independent public company as compared to being acquired. The Board of Directors discussed the financial and legal terms of the proposal, and
authorized the Company to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo and to proceed to finalize negotiations with respect to their proposal.
Later that day, representatives of Skadden and representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), counsel to Thoma Bravo, exchanged signatures from
their respective clients on an agreed-upon seven day exclusivity agreement. Thereafter, representatives from Kirkland and Skadden spoke regarding next
steps, and representatives from Kirkland indicated that Thoma Bravo would require voting agreements from members of the Board of Directors (including
Mr. Eberle) and Clearfield. Following that discussion, also on December 9, 2021, Kirkland provided Skadden with a form of the proposed voting
agreement.

Also on December 9, 2021, Bloomberg reported that the Company was exploring a potential sale and other options with assistance from Deutsche Bank
and had attracted interest from private equity buyers. The Company did not comment on this report.
During the period following the Company’s entry into an exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo on December 9, 2021 through the public announcement
of the Merger on December 17, 2021, approximately nine private equity firms or financial advisors purporting to represent possible buyers contacted
Deutsche Bank inquiring as to whether the Company was exploring a sale transaction, and Deutsche Bank did not engage with any of these parties given
the Company’s exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo. However, no proposals were made by any of these third parties.
During the period following the Company’s entry into an exclusivity agreement with Thoma Bravo, representatives of the Company had discussions with
representatives of Thoma Bravo relating to Thoma Bravo’s ongoing due diligence.
On December 12, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent proposed revisions to the Kirkland draft of the merger agreement and the equity commitment
letter, which proposed the following material revisions: specifying the amount of the termination fee payable by the Company, increasing the quantitative
threshold for the accuracy of the Company’s capitalization representations as a condition to closing, increasing the cap on post-termination damages,
limiting certain of Thoma Bravo’s termination rights and the circumstances triggering payment of a termination fee by the Company, and providing for 30
months of accelerated vesting (which includes the existing 12 month entitlement under the Company’s 2019 equity plan for equity awards, with unvested
awards being converted into time-based cash awards with their existing vesting schedule pulled forward by 30 months); and including certain
modifications to the overall suite of representations, warranties and covenants to be provided by each party under the merger agreement. Also on
December 12, 2021, Skadden shared the proposed form of voting agreement with members of the Board of Directors.
On December 13, 2021, representatives of SRZ provided comments on the voting agreement with Clearfield to Skadden, and Skadden provided such
comments to Kirkland.
On December 14, 2021, Skadden received markups of the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter from Kirkland, which proposed the following
material revisions: decreasing the quantitative threshold for the accuracy of the Company’s capitalization representations as a condition to closing,
decreasing the cap on post-termination damages, altering the accelerated vesting proposed by the Company (in addition to the existing 12 month
entitlement under the Company’s 2019 equity plan for equity awards) in a manner that meaningfully decreased the overall level of acceleration of equity
awards versus the Company’s proposal, capping the number of times that the Company could adjourn or postpone the stockholder meeting without
Thoma Bravo’s consent, requesting additional information with respect to and/or limiting the Company’s ability to issue equity awards to certain recent
or prospective new employees and to issue the second tranche of its fiscal year 2022 equity awards to non-named executive officer employees in the
ordinary course of business prior to the closing; and including certain modifications to the overall suite of representations, warranties and covenants to
be provided by each party under the merger agreement. Also on December 14, 2021, Skadden sent additional proposed revisions to the voting agreement
to Kirkland and to SRZ. Later that day, Kirkland returned the draft voting agreement with non-substantive revisions.
On December 15, 2021, Skadden sent a markup of the merger agreement and a revised draft of the disclosure schedules to the merger agreement to
Kirkland, reflecting resolution of issues that Skadden and Kirkland had discussed on telephone calls and over email, including with respect to the specific
regulatory approvals required for completion of the Merger, the amount of the cap on post-termination damages, the agreed treatment of Company equity
awards in the transaction, the Company’s ability to issue equity awards to certain recent or prospective new employees and to issue the second tranche
of its fiscal year 2022 equity awards to non-named executive officer employees in the ordinary course of business prior to the closing, and the Company’s
flexibility

to determine quarterly bonuses in the ordinary course of business prior to the closing (including the amount for the current calendar quarter available to
be paid to the Chief Financial Officer prior to December 31, 2021 as described under “—Interests of Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” beginning on page 55). Skadden and Kirkland continued to confer and exchange drafts in order to finalize the merger agreement, voting
agreement and disclosure schedules, until agreement on the final execution version was reached. Also on December 15, 2021, Company management
provided revised capitalization information to Thoma Bravo, reflecting fully diluted capitalization of the Company at September 30, 2021 of approximately
45 million shares.
On December 16, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting, with members of the Company’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank,
Skadden and WilmerHale in attendance. Mr. Eberle and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Skadden provided the Board of Directors with an update
on discussions and the resolution of open issues in the merger agreement. Representatives of Skadden described to the Board of Directors the
relationships disclosure that had been provided by Deutsche Bank in November 2021, with respect to any relationships between Deutsche Bank and the
potential bidders. This disclosure showed that Deutsche Bank received no material fees from Thoma Bravo since the beginning of 2021. Representatives
of Deutsche Bank reviewed with the Board of Directors their financial analyses, summarized below in the section entitled “ —Opinion of Bottomline’s
Financial Advisor” beginning on page 47. At the request of the Board of Directors, representatives of Deutsche Bank rendered the oral opinion of
Deutsche Bank, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 17, 2021, to the Board of Directors, and attached to
this proxy statement as Annex B, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to and based on the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations of the review set forth in the written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders
of Bottomline common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Representatives of Skadden also
described in detail the final terms of the merger agreement. After considering the proposed terms of the merger agreement and taking into consideration a
variety of factors, including those described in “—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger—Reasons for the Merger”
beginning on page 42, the Board of Directors unanimously (1) adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, (2) declared that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that the Company enter into the merger
agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the merger agreement, (3) declared that the terms of the merger agreement are fair to the Company and its stockholders and (4) subject to the provisions
of the merger agreement, recommended that the Company’s stockholders approve the merger agreement, and directed that the merger agreement be
submitted for consideration by Company stockholders at the Company special meeting.
On December 17, 2021, the Company issued a press release and filed a Form 8-K announcing the entry into the Merger Agreement and related matters.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has unanimously (1) adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (2) declared that it is in the best interests of Bottomline and its stockholders that Bottomline enter into the Merger Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the

the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Bottomline
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board of Directors consulted with outside legal counsel, its financial
advisor and Bottomline’s senior management. In recommending that Bottomline’s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, the
Board of Directors considered numerous positive factors relating to the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the following material factors (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
•
The relationship of the Per Share Merger Consideration to trading prices of Bottomline’s common stock, representing a premium of: (1)
approximately 41% and 40% to the unaffected 30-day and 60-day (respectively) volume weighted average stock price of Bottomline’s
common stock as of October 19, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the appointment of Michael Curran, Philip Hilal and
Larry Klane to the Board of Directors; and (2) approximately 13% to the closing price of Bottomline’s common stock on December 15, 2021,
the last trading day prior to the date on which Bottomline entered into the Merger Agreement.
•
The perceived risks and benefits of a variety of strategic alternatives for Bottomline, including a possible sale of Bottomline to potential
strategic or financial buyers other than Thoma Bravo, or a spin-off or divestiture of certain business units and the perceived lack of any
acquisition candidate or merger partner that would be transformative to Bottomline’s business and available on attractive terms if
Bottomline remained a public company.
•
The financial forecasts prepared by Bottomline’s senior management team, which reflected the potential impact of multiple key growth
drivers across Bottomline’s lines of business on a standalone basis. In addition, the view of the Board of Directors (which view was shared
by Bottomline’s senior management and by its financial advisor) that these financial forecasts were based on assumptions that are difficult
to project and were subject to high levels of uncertainty and also significant execution risk.
•
The current and prospective business environment in which Bottomline operates, including international, national and local economic
conditions, the competitive environment and the likely effect of these factors on Bottomline and the execution of Bottomline’s standalone
strategic plans.
•
The pace and magnitude of ongoing changes in the market for Bottomline’s products and the view of the Board of Directors (which view
was shared by Bottomline’s senior management and by its financial advisor) that the Company’s ability to invest in growth opportunities
was constrained by stockholder focus on near-term profitability, affecting both investment in product development as well as sales and
marketing and go-to-market activities for existing products, which could create disadvantages over the longer term relative to competitors
with public or private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings.
•
The Company’s past success in using acquisitions to enhance its product offerings and market scope as new technologies and
opportunities emerged, and the view of the Board of Directors (which view was shared by Bottomline’s senior management and by its
financial advisor) that it could be more difficult to execute successful acquisitions in the future given the increased valuations of potentially
attractive targets and the constraints on the Company’s ability to invest in acquisitions relative to competitors with public or private market
valuations based on growth rather than earnings.
•
Concerns relative to attracting and retaining key, experienced talent at various levels of the Company’s business, and the view of the Board
of Directors (which view was shared by Bottomline’s senior management and by its financial advisor) that these concerns could worsen in
the future given both the constraints on the Company’s ability to offer competitive compensation relative to some competitors with public
or private market valuations based on growth rather than earnings and the negative impact of recent and potential future declines in the
Company’s stock price on employee incentives.

•
The view of the Board of Directors (which view was shared by Bottomline’s senior management and by its financial advisor) that certain of
the risks described above could occur in combination to negatively affect Bottomline and its business.
•
The fact that the all-cash Per Share Merger Consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to Bottomline’s stockholders, while
eliminating the effects of long-term business and execution risk to Bottomline’s stockholders.
•
The fact that Bottomline was contacted by a number of parties and/or actively sought proposals from additional parties that it and its
financial advisor believed were logical potential buyers, as more fully described above under the heading “— Background of the Merger,”
including both strategic and financial buyers:
•
Bottomline and its financial advisor collectively communicated with eight strategic buyers and eleven financial buyers regarding their
interest in acquiring the Company, Bottomline entered into NDAs with seven financial buyers, Bottomline conducted management
presentations attended by seven financial buyers (including Party B and Party C), and Bottomline granted access to a data room to six
financial buyers.
•
Of these parties, Thoma Bravo, Party B and Party C submitted written proposals with a specified price range.
•
Only Thoma Bravo submitted a proposed final equity commitment letter for the full amount of the merger consideration and proposed
a discrete limited period of additional time for confirmatory due diligence and negotiation.
•
Party B indicated a price range of $50.00 to $55.00 per share and required additional time to conduct further diligence before
submitting an updated written proposal.
•
The fact that Thoma Bravo’s final price had increased from an initial range of $52.00 to $55.00 per share, to a subsequent bid of $56.50 per
share, and ultimately to a final bid of $57.00 per share, which Bottomline, after consultation with its financial advisor, believed was the
maximum price at which Thoma Bravo would transact.
•
The risk that prolonging the sale process further could have resulted in the loss of the opportunity to successfully consummate a
transaction on favorable terms and potentially jeopardized customer and employee relationships.
•
The financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Board of Directors by representatives of Deutsche Bank at numerous meetings of
the Board of Directors in connection with the Merger, which included the opinion of Deutsche Bank that, as of December 16, 2021, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to holders
of shares of Bottomline common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more
fully described below under the caption “ — Opinion of Bottomline’s Financial Advisor.”
•
The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents, including:

Parent’s commitments in the Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger (subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement);

the equity commitment letter;
•
Bottomline’s ability, subject to certain conditions in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of the Thoma Bravo Fund’s
obligation to make the equity contributions pursuant to
44
Table of Contents
the equity commitment letter (and, if specific performance is not obtained, to seek damages for Parent’s willful and material breach of
the Merger Agreement (subject to a cap of $195,000,000), which damages are covered by the equity commitment letter from the Thoma
Bravo Fund);
•
Bottomline’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent
breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce the terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
Parent’s commitment in the Merger Agreement to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the equity financing
pursuant to the terms of the equity commitment letter;
•
Bottomline’s ability, in certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations
with a third party regarding an unsolicited alternative acquisition proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal;
•
The ability of the Board of Directors to change its recommendation in response to a superior proposal or terminate the Merger
Agreement in favor of a superior proposal, subject to Parent’s ability to match such superior proposal and subject to the Company’s
payment to Parent of a termination fee of $78,000,000;
•
The ability of the Board of Directors to change its recommendation in response to an intervening event not related to an alternative
acquisition proposal not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors prior to December 16, 2021, subject to Parent’s
ability to propose adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement that may convince the Board of Directors not to
change its recommendation, and subject to Parent’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement following such change in
recommendation and to collect a termination fee of $78,000,000;
•
The fact that the termination fee payable by the Company is approximately equal to 3% of the purchase price, which amount the
Board of Directors believed was reasonable in light of, among other matters, the benefits of the Merger to Bottomline’s stockholders,
the typical size of such termination fees in similar transactions and the likelihood that a fee of such size would not be a meaningful
deterrent to alternative acquisition proposals;
•
The fact that the Merger is subject to the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bottomline’s common
stock, and the fact that, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the Company had received the support of holders of approximately 4% of
the Company’s outstanding shares, as of the date of the Voting Agreement;
•
The fact that the end date is December 16, 2022, allowing for sufficient time to complete the Merger;
•
The fact that the Merger Agreement has customary terms and was the product of extensive arms-length negotiations by Bottomline
and Bottomline’s professional advisors; and
•
The fact that the Voting Agreement terminates in the event that the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in any manner thereunder,
as more fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The
Voting Agreement”.
•
The availability of statutory appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger for Company stockholders who properly
exercise their rights under the DGCL.
•
The fact that resolutions approving the Merger Agreement were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors, which is comprised of a
majority of independent directors who are neither affiliated with Thoma Bravo nor employees of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries, and
which retained and received advice from Bottomline’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor in evaluating, negotiating and
recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement.
45
Table of Contents
In the course of reaching the determinations and decisions and making the recommendation described above, the Board of Directors, in consultation with
Bottomline’s senior management, outside legal counsel and financial advisor, considered the risks and potentially negative factors relating to the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following material factors (which factors are not
necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
•
The fact that Bottomline’s public stockholders will have no ongoing equity interest in the surviving corporation following the Merger,
meaning that the stockholders will cease to participate in Bottomline’s potential future earnings or growth and benefit from any potential
increases in the value of Bottomline’s common stock.
•
The possibility that the consummation of the Merger may be delayed or not occur at all, and the adverse impact such event would have on
Bottomline and its business.
•
The restrictions on the conduct of Bottomline’s business during the period between execution of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger, which may delay or prevent Bottomline from undertaking business opportunities that may arise during such
time which, absent the Merger Agreement, Bottomline might otherwise have pursued.
•
The possible disruption to Bottomline’s business that may result from announcement of the Merger and the resulting distraction of
management’s attention from day-to-day operations of the business.
•
The potential negative effect of the pendency of the Merger Agreement on Bottomline’s business, including:
•
uncertainty about the effect of the proposed Merger on Bottomline’s employees, which may impair Bottomline’s ability to attract,
retain and motivate key personnel; and
•
uncertainty about the effect of the proposed Merger on Bottomline’s customers, suppliers and other third parties, which could cause
customers, suppliers and other third parties to seek to change existing business relationships with Bottomline.
•
The fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Bottomline is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of
the Merger Agreement.
•
The fact that if the Merger is not consummated, Bottomline will be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement,
and the fact that the resulting public announcement of termination of the Merger Agreement could affect the trading price of Bottomline’s
common stock.
•
The fact that Bottomline must pay a termination fee of $78,000,000 to Parent if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with the
Company accepting a superior proposal, due to the Board of Directors’ changing or withdrawing its recommendation of the Merger, or
under certain other circumstances in connection with the Company entering into an agreement for a transaction involving at least 50% of
the Company’s stock or assets.
•
The fact that Bottomline must reimburse Parent’s expenses up to $5,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances (with the amount of such expenses deducted from any termination fee that subsequently becomes payable to Parent by
Bottomline).
•
The fact that the receipt of cash by stockholders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
The fact that the completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances and consents, including under U.S. antitrust rules and
U.K. financial regulatory authority rules, which clearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risk.
•
The fact that some of Bottomline’s directors and executive officers may be deemed to have interests in the Merger that are different from, or
in addition to, the interests of Bottomline’s stockholders generally, as more fully described below under the caption “—Interests of
Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Table of Contents
•
The risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the Company or its directors or officers, and potential
effects of outcomes related thereto.
•
The possible loss of key management or other personnel of Bottomline during the pendency of the Merger.
The Board of Directors believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the Merger to Bottomline’s stockholders outweighed the risks and uncertainties of
the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board of Directors contains the material factors considered by the Board of Directors, but is not in
any way intended to be exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Board of Directors did
not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and
recommendations. Each member of the Board of Directors applied his or her own business judgment to the process and may have given different weight
to different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor or any particular aspect of a
factor supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its recommendation on the totality of the information
presented.
Opinion of Bottomline’s Financial Advisor
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated as of September 20, 2021, Deutsche Bank acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors in connection with
the Merger. At the December 16, 2021 meeting of the Board of Directors, Deutsche Bank delivered its opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions set forth in the
opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Bottomline’s common stock.
The full text of Deutsche Bank’s written opinion, dated as of December 17, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions of the review undertaken by Deutsche Bank in connection with its opinion, is attached as Annex

by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and is addressed to, and is for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors in connection with
and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Merger. Deutsche Bank’s opinion is limited to the fairness of the Per Share Merger Consideration, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Bottomline’s common stock as of the date of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s opinion does not address any other
terms of the Merger or the Merger Agreement, nor does it address the terms of any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection
with the Merger. Deutsche Bank was not asked to, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not, address the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration
received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor did it address the
fairness of the contemplated benefits of the Merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to
engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Deutsche Bank did not
express any opinion, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holders of shares of Bottomline’s common stock
should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Deutsche Bank did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or
otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company’s officers, directors, or employees, or any
class of such persons, in connection with the Merger relative to the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Bottomline’s
common stock. The summary of Deutsche Bank’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
Deutsche Bank’s opinion set forth as Annex B. Holders of Bottomline’s common stock are urged to read Deutsche Bank’s opinion in its entirety.

Table of Contents
In connection with Deutsche Bank’s role as financial advisor to the Board of Directors, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank has, among other
things, reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Company and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and
other information relating to the Company prepared and furnished to Deutsche Bank by the management of the Company and approved for Deutsche
Bank’s use by the Company. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain senior officers of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of
the Company. In addition, Deutsche Bank has:
•
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Bottomline’s common stock;
•
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies Deutsche
Bank considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded;
•
reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which it deemed relevant;
•
reviewed the Merger Agreement; and
•
performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.
In preparing its opinion, Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for the independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any
information, whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in
connection with the rendering of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, with the knowledge and permission of the Board, Deutsche Bank
assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the
properties or assets and did not prepare, obtain or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets or liabilities) of the Company or any of its respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the
solvency or fair value of the Company under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made
available to Deutsche Bank and used in its analyses, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, assumed that such
forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as
to the matters covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or
the assumptions on which they are based. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was necessarily based upon the economic, market and other conditions as in effect
on, and the information made available to Deutsche Bank as of, the date of such opinion. Deutsche Bank expressly disclaimed any undertaking or
obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting Deutsche Bank’s opinion of which it becomes aware after the date of the
opinion.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, has assumed that, in all respects
material to its analysis:
•
the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of
any term, condition or agreement that would be material to Deutsche Bank’s analysis; and
•
all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the Merger will be
obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions,
terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to Deutsche Bank’s analysis.
Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting expert and has relied on the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with
respect to these issues.
Deutsche Bank’s Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses contained in the presentation that was made by Deutsche Bank to the Board on December
16, 2021 and that were used by Deutsche Bank in connection with
48
Table of Contents
rendering its opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by Deutsche Bank, nor does the order of the analyses described below represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Deutsche Bank or the Board. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Deutsche Bank’s financial analyses. Certain
financial, comparative and other analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the
text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 15, 2021, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions. In performing its analyses, Deutsche Bank made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. None of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, Deutsche Bank or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any
estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which the businesses could actually be sold.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Deutsche Bank performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company on a standalone basis using financial forecasts, data and other information
provided by the Company’s management to calculate a range of implied equity values per share of the Company discounted to December 15, 2021.
In performing the discounted cash flow analysis, Deutsche Bank applied a range of discount rates of 9.00% to 10.00% to the sum of (i) unlevered free
cash flows estimated to be generated by the Company for the fiscal years 2022 to 2031, as calculated based on financial forecasts and data provided by
the Company’s management and (ii) estimated terminal values of the Company calculated using perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.50% to 3.50%. For
purposes of its analysis, Deutsche Bank calculated unlevered free cash flow as (a) adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(which we refer to as “Adjusted EBITDA”), less (b) capital expenditures, less (c) stock based compensation, less (d) cash taxes, plus (e) increase
(decrease) in deferred revenue, and less (f) increase (decrease) in working capital, in each case as provided to Deutsche Bank by the Company’s
management.
Deutsche Bank derived the foregoing range of discount rates using a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on a risk free rate of 1.87% using
the 20-year U.S. Treasury yield as of December 15, 2021, and certain other financial metrics, including betas, for the Company and the other selected
companies described below.
The analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Bottomline’s common stock of $41.90 to $57.21 per share.
Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies
Deutsche Bank compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for the Company to corresponding information and
measurements of certain publicly traded companies that Deutsche Bank considered relevant for the Company. In determining the universe of comparable
companies for the Company, Deutsche Bank considered a variety of factors, based on publicly available information, including, but not limited to,
similarity in company portfolio, size and geographic exposure. However, because of the inherent differences between the businesses, operations and
prospects of the Company and those of the selected comparable companies, Deutsche Bank believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not,
rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected publicly traded company analysis. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank also made qualitative judgments
concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and
49
Table of Contents
prospects of the Company and the selected comparable companies that could affect the values of the Company in order to provide a context in which to
consider the results of the quantitative analysis for Company. Deutsche Bank selected comparable companies with businesses in the categories of
financial software and payment technology.
To calculate the trading multiples for the selected companies, Deutsche Bank used publicly available information concerning historical and projected
financial performance, including published historical financial information and forecasted estimates based on widely used industry data and research
providers and public filings made by the selected companies. Using such financial information, Deutsche Bank reviewed for each of these companies,
among other things: (i) the ratio of enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA (which we refer to as “EV/EBITDA”) and (ii) the ratio of enterprise value to
revenue (which we refer to as “EV/Revenue”). The companies reviewed and analysis indicated the following, with multiples based on publicly available
research analyst median calendar year 2022 estimates:

Based in part upon the EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue multiples of the selected companies described above and taking into account their professional
judgment and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated ranges of estimated implied value per share of Bottomline’s common stock by:
•
applying multiples of EV/EBITDA of 16.0x to 20.0x to the Company’s management estimates of CY 2022 Adjusted EBITDA, resulting in a
range of implied values of $40.14 to $50.20 per share of Bottomline’s common stock; and
•
applying multiples of EV/Revenue of 4.0x to 5.0x to the Company’s management estimates of CY 2022 revenue, resulting in a range of implied
values of $50.00 to $62.53 per share of Bottomline’s common stock
Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions
Deutsche Bank reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of thirteen financial software and payment technology transactions since
April 2018 that Deutsche Bank deemed, in its professional judgment and experience, as comparable to the Company in certain business and financial
respects. In its analysis, Deutsche
50
Table of Contents
Bank derived and compared, among other things, the mean and median values of multiples for the ratio of total enterprise value to last-twelve-months
Adjusted EBITDA (which we refer to as “TEV/LTM EBITDA”). To calculate the comparative data for the selected transactions, Deutsche Bank used
publicly available information from public filings, FactSet and Wall Street research. The transactions reviewed and analysis indicated the following:

Based upon the results of the selected precedent transactions analysis, Deutsche Bank calculated ranges of estimated implied value per share of
Bottomline’s common stock by applying multiples of TEV/EBITDA of 20.0x to 24.0x to the Company’s management estimates of last twelve months
Adjusted EBITDA, resulting in a range of implied values of $42.49 to $51.01 per share of Bottomline’s common stock.
Additional Informational Analysis
Deutsche Bank observed certain additional information that, based on Deutsche Bank’s professional judgment and experience, Deutsche Bank did not
consider to be part of its financial analysis with respect to its opinion but was noted for informational purposes, including the following:
Historical Trading Range Analysis
Deutsche Bank performed a trading range analysis with respect to the historical share prices of Bottomline’s common stock. Deutsche Bank noted that
the low and high prices per share of Bottomline’s common stock during the 52-week period ending on December 15, 2021 were $36.49 and $54.39. As of
December 15, 2021, the closing price per share of Bottomline’s common stock was $50.36.
Deutsche Bank noted that the trading range analysis was presented merely for reference purposes only, and was not relied upon for valuation purposes.
Wall Street Price Targets
Deutsche Bank reviewed the stock price targets for Bottomline’s common stock in several recently published, publicly available research analysts’
reports, which indicated low and high stock price targets ranging from $50.00 to $57.21 per share. Such range excluded publications after December 9,
2021, the date Bloomberg reported that the Company was exploring a sale, to reflect unaffected stock price targets from research analysts.
51
Table of Contents
Deutsche Bank noted that the analyst price targets were presented merely for reference purposes only, and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary is not a comprehensive description of all analyses performed and factors considered by Deutsche Bank in connection with
preparing its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective business judgment in
determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and,
therefore, is not readily susceptible to a summary description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading view of
the process underlying the opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Deutsche Bank did not assign specific weights to any particular analyses.
In conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses were
prepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its opinion to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Bottomline’s common stock, of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual past or future values or results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.
Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the Company or its
advisors, neither the Company nor Deutsche Bank nor any other person assumes responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different
from these forecasts or assumptions.
The terms of the Merger were determined through negotiations between the Company and Parent and were approved by the Board of Directors.
Although Deutsche Bank provided advice to the Board during the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter into the Merger was solely that of
the Board of Directors. As described above, the opinion and presentation of Deutsche Bank to the Board of Directors were only one of a number of
factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its determination to approve the Merger. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was provided to the Board of
Directors to assist it in connection with its consideration of the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any holders of Bottomline’s
common stock as to how to vote on any matter.
Additional Information
The Board of Directors selected Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on Deutsche Bank’s qualifications, expertise,
reputation and experience in mergers and acquisitions. The Company has retained Deutsche Bank pursuant to an engagement letter dated as of
September 20, 2021, as amended. As compensation for Deutsche Bank’s services in connection with the Merger, the Company has agreed to pay to
Deutsche Bank the following fees:
•
an opinion fee of $1,000,000, which became payable upon Deutsche Bank’s delivery of its written opinion, dated as of December 17, 2021, to
the Company;
•
a transaction fee contingent on the consummation of the Merger of approximately $25 million, equal to 0.95% of the value of the aggregate
consideration (as defined in the engagement letter), which is estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion as of December 14, 2021; provided
that the transaction fee shall be reduced by the opinion fee described in the preceding bullet; and
•
if the transaction is not consummated and the Company or its subsidiaries are entitled to any payment (including, without limitation, a
break-up fee, lock-up option, topping fee or other termination fee or any judgment or settlement in connection with a litigation or other
proceeding related to the failure of the Merger) (which we refer to collectively as a “Termination Fee”), a fee equal to 20% of such
52
Table of Contents
Termination Fee, net the Company’s out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction and collection of such
Termination Fee, at such time as such Termination Fee is received by the Company or its subsidiaries; provided that the such fee shall not
be greater than the transaction fee shall be reduced by the amount of any previously paid opinion fee, without duplication of any other
offset of such opinion fee.
Regardless of whether the Merger is consummated, the Company has agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for reasonable and documented fees, expenses
and disbursements of Deutsche Bank’s counsel and all of Deutsche Bank’s reasonable and documented travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger or otherwise arising out of the engagement of Deutsche Bank under the engagement letter provided that if such fees
exceed $100,000 in the aggregate, such excess fees will only be reimbursed if incurred with the prior written consent of the Company. The Company has
also agreed to indemnify Deutsche Bank and certain related persons to the full extent lawful against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement or the
Merger.
Deutsche Bank is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with mergers and acquisitions and
related transactions. Deutsche Bank is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, which, together with its affiliates, are referred to in this proxy statement as the
DB Group. One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are currently providing, commercial banking (including extension
of credit) and other financial services to Parent or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, compensation, including (i)
acting as joint arranger for an entity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P., an affiliate of Parent, on a debt financing transaction in February 2019, (ii) acting as
joint bookrunner for an entity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P. and lender on a debt financing transaction in November 2020, (iii) receiving deferred fees
from an entity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P. in June 2021 in connection with a SPAC initial public offering and (iv) acting as joint bookrunner for an
entity affiliated with Thoma Bravo, L.P. on debt financing transactions in October 2020 and January, March, April, May and September 2021. In addition,
the DB Group may also provide investment and commercial banking services to Parent and the Company in the future, for which Deutsche Bank would
expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other
instruments and obligations of Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers.
Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations.",49,60

In connection with the Board of Directors’ review of potential strategic alternatives and its evaluation of a potential sale transaction, the Company’s
management team prepared projections of the Company’s financial performance for the fiscal years 2022 through 2026 (which forecasts are referred to
herein as the “Financial Projections”). In the course of due diligence, the Company provided Thoma Bravo with the Financial Projections. The Financial
Projections also were provided to Deutsche Bank which was directed to use and rely upon the Financial Projections for purposes of its financial analysis
and fairness opinion as described above under “—Opinion of Bottomline’s Financial Advisor”.
The Financial Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Company management at the time prepared, including with
respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to the
Company.
Bottomline uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (which we refer to as
“GAAP”) as supplemental measures to evaluate its operational performance. While Bottomline believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide
useful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. Please read carefully “—Important
Information About the Financial Projections” below.

Important Information About the Financial Projections
The summary of the Financial Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any Bottomline shareholder to vote in favor of the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting.
The inclusion of information about the Financial Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company,
Thoma Bravo or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it necessarily predictive of actual future results or material
information given the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts.
The Financial Projections are subjective in many respects and, thus, subject to interpretation. Although presented with numeric specificity, the Financial
Projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance and competition, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and matters specific to the Company’s businesses, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s
control. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions underlying the Financial Projections will be realized.
Many of the assumptions reflected in the Financial Projections are subject to change and the Financial Projections do not reflect revised prospects for
the Company’s business, changes in general business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and
that was not anticipated at the time such financial information was prepared. The Company has not updated and does not intend to update or otherwise
revise the Financial Projections. There can be no assurance that the results reflected in the Financial Projections will be realized or that actual results will
not materially vary from the Financial Projections. In
54
Table of Contents
addition, the Financial Projections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Therefore,
the Financial Projections included in this proxy statement should not be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events nor construed as
financial guidance.
Bottomline shareholders are urged to review the Company’s most recent SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company’s
business. You should read “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information regarding the risks inherent in
forward-looking information such as the Financial Projections and “Where You Can Find More Information”.
The Financial Projections were not prepared with a view toward complying with GAAP (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures, and
the forecasts contained therein do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding
projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled,
examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the Financial Projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on
the Financial Projections or the achievability of the results reflected in the Financial Projections, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any
association with, the Financial Projections. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP measures such as those used in the Financial Projections may not be comparable to similarly titled
amounts used by other companies or persons.
The non-GAAP measures set forth above should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a
business combination transaction, such as the Financial Projections, are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” under applicable
SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Financial Projections are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures,
which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the
financial measures included in the Financial Projections is provided in this proxy statement For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy
statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Financial Projections. The Company has not made any representation to Parent in the
Merger Agreement concerning any of the Financial Projections.
The information about the Financial Projections set forth above does not give effect to the Merger and also does not take into account the effect of any
failure of the Merger to be consummated.
THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE ABOVE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS TO REFLECT
CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT
THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT REALIZED.

Philip Hilal, a director of Bottomline, is also the Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Clearfield Capital Management LP. As of January 24, 2022, Mr.
Hilal beneficially owned 935,000 shares (approximately 2.1%) of Bottomline’s common stock (which includes shares that Mr. Hilal may be deemed to
beneficially own by virtue of his positions at Clearfield Capital Management LP). As of January 24, 2022, Clearfield Capital Management LP beneficially
owned 925,000 shares (approximately 2.1%) of Bottomline’s common stock.
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time, (1) for any unvested restricted stock
award or unvested restricted stock unit award the vesting of which is conditioned upon both time-based vesting and the attainment of performance
conditions and that remains outstanding and subject to such performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of
shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such unvested restricted stock award or unvested restricted stock unit award will be fixed at the Effective
Time based upon the target level of performance, and (2) each outstanding unvested stock option and each outstanding unvested restricted stock award
and unvested restricted stock unit award will be credited the Additional Vesting Credit. The Additional Vesting Credit includes the 12 months of “change
in control” accelerated vesting provided in Bottomline’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and is without limitation of any more favorable vesting
provisions in any other plan or agreement between Bottomline and any employee (described below for our named executive officers, where applicable).
Treatment of Stock Options in the Merger
As of January 24, 2022, there were 1,051 outstanding options to acquire Bottomline common stock, all of which options were both vested and “in-the-
money,” meaning that they have an exercise price less than $57.00 per share. Bottomline’s directors and executive officers held none of such stock
options. As of the Effective Time, each option that is outstanding will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable
tax withholding) equal to the product of (1) the excess of $57.00 over the exercise price per share of Bottomline common stock underlying such stock
option; and (2) the total number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such option.
Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards in the Merger
As of January 24, 2022, there were 2,270,108 outstanding restricted stock awards, 678,196 of which were held by our directors and executive officers. As
of the Effective Time, the portion of each restricted stock award which is vested (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit), will be converted
into the right to receive the product of (i) $57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such restricted stock
award. Each other outstanding restricted stock award will be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(i) $57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such restricted stock award, which amount will, generally subject
to the holder’s continued service with Bottomline, Parent or an affiliate through the applicable vesting date and vest and be payable at the same time and
on the same terms as the restricted stock award for which such cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (except that any applicable
performance conditions will be deemed to have been achieved at target levels and after giving effect to Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under
Bottomline’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, if the holder’s employment is terminated other than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of
the Effective Time, the cash amount to which such restricted stock award relates will immediately vest.
Treatment of Restricted Stock Unit Awards in the Merger
As of January 24, 2022, there were 190,835 outstanding restricted stock units, none of which were held by our directors and executive officers. As of the
Effective Time, the portion of each restricted stock unit award which is vested (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit), will be converted into
the right to receive a payment
56
Table of Contents
equal to the product of (i) $57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award. Each
other outstanding restricted stock unit award will be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i)
$57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Bottomline common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award, which amount will, subject to the
holder’s continued service with Bottomline, Parent or an affiliate through the applicable vesting date and vest at the same time and on the same terms as
the restricted stock unit to which such cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (except that any applicable performance conditions
will be deemed to have been achieved at target levels and after giving effect to Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline’s 2019 Stock
Incentive Plan, if the holder’s employment is terminated other than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective Time, the
cash amount to which such restricted stock unit award relates will immediately vest..
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, no new offering period or purchase period will be commenced following the date of the Merger Agreement under the
ESPP, and the offering period or purchase period in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement will be the final offering period or purchase period under
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Participants will not be permitted to increase the amount of their payroll deduction elections under the ESPP during
the final offering period or purchase period, and no new individuals will be permitted to commence participation in the ESPP prior to the Effective Time.
The ESPP will be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Equity Interests of Bottomline’s Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors
The following table sets forth the number of shares of Bottomline common stock and the number of shares of Bottomline common stock underlying
restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards that, as of January 24, 2022, were held by each of Bottomline’s executive officers (including the
named executive officers) and non-employee directors, in each case that either were then-currently vested or that will or may vest in connection with the
Merger. The table also sets forth the values of these shares and equity awards based on the $57.00 Per Share Merger Consideration.

Potential Severance Payments and Benefits
Employment, Service and Retention Agreements
Bottomline is party to employment agreements or similar arrangements with Mr. Eberle, Mr. Bowden, Mr. DeLuca and Mr. Savory which provide for certain
benefits upon a “change in control”, including the treatment of unvested equity awards and in certain instances severance benefits. Under each of the
agreements a change in control will occur upon the closing of the Merger. The following descriptions are qualified by reference to the full agreements as
previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Robert A. Eberle Employment Agreement
Bottomline is party to an employment agreement with Mr. Eberle which provides for certain payments and benefits that will or may be payable upon or in
connection with the closing of the Merger. Under the employment agreement with Mr. Eberle, the closing of the Merger will constitute a “change in
control” of Bottomline; and the employment agreement provides that upon a change in control, Mr. Eberle’s restricted stock awards will vest in full. The
employment agreement also provides that if Mr. Eberle’s employment is terminated during a potential change in control (Bottomline’s entry into the
Merger Agreement resulted in such a potential change in control), either by Mr. Eberle as a result of an involuntary termination or by Bottomline without
cause (in each case as defined in the employment agreement), all of his restricted stock awards will vest in full. In the event of such a termination either
during a potential change in control or following a change in control, Mr. Eberle will be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to three
times the sum of (i) Mr. Eberle’s then annual salary and (ii) the maximum amount of any bonus Mr. Eberle was eligible to earn for the then-current fiscal
year, as well as continuation of benefits for a period of 24 months. If Mr. Eberle is not continuing his employment with the Company following closing, he
will be entitled to these payments immediately prior to the closing.
The employment agreement also provides that, in the event of a change in control, Bottomline will pay any excise tax for which Mr. Eberle would be liable
under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), as a result of having received change in control related payments or benefits, as
well as the amount necessary to pay all additional taxes imposed on Mr. Eberle as a result of Bottomline’s payment of the excise tax. No such additional
payment is expected to be required in connection with the Merger.
A. Bruce Bowden Retention Agreement
Bottomline is party to an executive retention agreement with Mr. Bowden. Under the terms of the retention agreement, if Mr. Bowden’s employment is
terminated by Bottomline other than for cause, disability or death or by Mr. Bowden for good reason (which definition includes his ceasing to serve as
the Chief Financial Officer of Bottomline as a standalone publicly traded company as a result of the change in control event, which will occur upon the
closing of the Merger), in either case, within 12 months following a change in control, then subject to Mr. Bowden’s execution of a general release of
claims in favor of Bottomline, Mr. Bowden will receive severance in an amount equal to his base salary for the six months prior to the date of termination
and an amount equal to 50% of his annual bonus opportunity for the most recently completed fiscal year. In connection with such termination of
employment, he will also be entitled (among other things) to payment of a pro-rated portion of his annual bonus opportunity for the fiscal year in which
termination of employment occurs and an amount equal to 50% of any commissions paid to him over the previous 12-month period, and all shares of
restricted stock and restricted stock units will vest in connection with such a termination (which vesting is not subject to the release of claims
requirement). If, following such a termination, Mr. Bowden timely elects and remains eligible for benefits continuation pursuant to federal COBRA laws,
Bottomline will pay any difference between
58
Table of Contents
the premiums for health continuation coverage and the amount for which Mr. Bowden would otherwise be responsible with respect to the medical and
dental coverage elected until the earlier of 12 months after the date of termination and the date on which Mr. Bowden becomes covered under another
employer insurance plan that provides substantially similar in the aggregate or greater coverage than the Company’s health plans.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if Mr. Bowden remains employed by the Company at the time of the closing, he will be entitled to the Additional
Vesting Credit with respect to his outstanding equity awards as well as full vesting of his remaining unvested equity awards due to his having “good
reason” as of the effective date.
Bottomline is also party to an employment agreement with Mr. Bowden; however, all payments and benefits payable in connection with the Merger would
be provided pursuant to Mr. Bowden’s retention agreement described above.
Norman J. DeLuca Employment Agreement
Bottomline is party to an employment agreement with Mr. DeLuca, which provides that any restricted stock granted to Mr. Deluca will vest in full upon a
change in control. In addition, if Mr. DeLuca’s employment is terminated by Bottomline without cause, either before or after a change in control, he will be
provided six months’ salary and benefits, and a lump sum payment equal to 50% of his annual bonus opportunity pursuant to Bottomline’s severance
practice with respect to senior executives.
Nigel K. Savory Service Agreement
Bottomline is party to a Service Agreement with Mr. Savory. The Service Agreement generally provides that during a transition period running from
March 12, 2022 until June 1, 2023, either Bottomline or Mr. Savory may provide written notice that the working arrangement pursuant to the service
agreement is either not working as desired or not one the party desires to continue, subject to certain exceptions in the case of Mr. Savory. In the event
that either Bottomline or Mr. Savory exercises its right to serve such notice (the “transition notice”) during the transition period, then, subject to Mr.
Savory’s execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company, (i) Mr. Savory will be entitled to severance in the form of 12 months’ base salary
continuation (subject to certain offsets) and a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of the bonus paid to him in the 12 months prior to
the termination date multiplied by 0.5 and (ii) each outstanding equity award held by Mr. Savory as of the termination date will continue to vest until the
earlier of (a) such time as it is vested in full in accordance with its terms, (b) the end of the period of 24 months following the termination date, during
which period Mr. Savory agrees to provide services to Bottomline as a strategic adviser, (c) the date on which he commences alternative employment or
engagement with another entity, subject to certain exceptions and (d) the date upon which he terminates, or materially breaches the terms of, the strategic
advisor agreement.
In addition, if Mr. Savory’s employment terminates (i) following his receipt of a transition notice from Bottomline and (ii) within 12 months following a
change in control (and other than as a result of his death or disability), then each equity award held by him as of the termination date will immediately
vest in full.
Under Mr. Savory’s Service Agreement, if Bottomline terminates Mr. Savory’s employment without cause (and other than as a result of Mr. Savory’s
death or disability) outside of the transition period (i.e., prior to March 12, 2022 or following June 1, 2023) regardless of whether such termination of
employment occurs before or after a change in control, then, subject to Mr. Savory’s execution of a release of claims against the company, (i) Bottomline
has agreed to pay Mr. Savory severance in the form of 12 months’ base salary continuation (subject to certain offsets) and a lump sum cash payment in
an amount equal to the sum of the bonus paid in the 12 months prior to the termination date multiplied by 0.5 and (ii) all outstanding equity awards held
by him as of the termination date will immediately vest in full.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if Mr. Savory is employed by the Company at the time of the closing, he will be entitled to the Additional Vesting
Credit with respect to his outstanding equity awards and full vesting of his
59
Table of Contents
remaining unvested equity awards upon a qualifying termination of employment within two years of the effective date. If Mr. Savory is serving as a
strategic advisor at the time of closing, he will be entitled to the Additional Vesting Credit with respect to his outstanding equity awards.
John F. Kelly Special Advisor and Transition Agreement
Bottomline is also party to a Special Advisor and Transition Agreement with Mr. Kelly, under which Mr. Kelly continues to serve as Special Advisor to
Bottomline following the termination of his employment that occurred on August 24, 2021, and pursuant to which his stock awards will continue to vest
through August 24, 2022 and are thus entitled to the Additional Vesting Credit provided in the Merger Agreement, which will result in full vesting of his
remaining awards.
Stock Incentive Plans
In addition to the change in control provisions in such individual employment arrangements, our stock incentive plans contain provisions that are
applicable to all plan participants regarding the consequences of a “Change in Control Event” (which will occur upon the Effective Time). Generally, the
plans provide that the vesting schedule of any unvested restricted stock award or restricted stock unit award would be accelerated in part such that what
would have otherwise become vested on any date within one year after the date of the Change in Control Event would immediately become vested.
Additionally, each unvested restricted stock award or restricted stock unit award would immediately become free from all vesting conditions or
restrictions if, on or prior to the second anniversary of the date of the consummation of the Change in Control Event, the plan participant’s employment
with the Company or the acquiring or succeeding corporation is terminated for Good Reason (as defined in the applicable plan) by the participant or is
terminated without Cause (as defined in the applicable plan) by the Company or the acquiring or succeeding corporation. Awards that vest in whole or in
part based on specified performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the target level upon the consummation of the Change in Control Event.
Awards continue to be subject to their original service-based vesting requirements (if any) and be accelerated, as applicable, as described in the
preceding two sentences of this paragraph. Such accelerated vesting provision will not apply to our outstanding stock options, all of which were fully
vested as of January 24, 2022. In addition, all restricted stock awards held by our non-employee directors will immediately vest in full at closing given that
such awards would otherwise vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The foregoing description is only a summary and is qualified by reference
to the applicable plan.
Golden Parachute Compensation
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation that is based on or otherwise related to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement for each of Bottomline’s executive officers who were designated as “named executive officers” in
Bottomline Proxy Statement filed on October 21, 2021. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC
disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the compensation and benefits related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement that will or may be payable to those named executive officers. The amounts set forth in the table below are based on multiple assumptions
that may or may not actually prove correct, including assumptions described in in the footnotes to the tables below. As a result, the actual amounts
received by a named executive officer in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may differ materially from the amounts
set forth below.
The table below sets forth, for the purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, the amount of payments and benefits that each of Bottomline’s named
executive officers would receive, assuming that (i) the closing occurs on May 31, 2022 (which is the assumed closing date solely for purposes of this
golden parachute compensation disclosure); (ii) each of Bottomline’s named executive officers is employed or providing services to Bottomline at the
closing and, to the extent employed, experiences a qualifying termination of employment immediately following the closing; (iii) the unvested Bottomline
restricted shares outstanding as of May 31, 2022 become
60
Table of Contents
fully vested as a result of either the occurrence of a “change in control” or, for named executive officers who are employed at that time, a qualifying
termination; (iv) no named executive officer receives any additional equity grants or retention awards on or prior to the closing; and (v) no named
executive officer enters into any new agreement or becomes entitled to, prior to the closing, additional compensation or benefits related to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Under relevant SEC rules, Bottomline is required to provide information in this table with respect to Bottomline’s named executive officers, who for
these purposes are the individuals whose compensation was required to be reported in the summary compensation table of Bottomline’s most
recent proxy statement. Although Richard D. Booth was a named executive officer in Bottomline’s most recent proxy statement, he is no longer
employed by Bottomline and is not eligible to receive any compensation based on, or otherwise related to, the Merger.

Except as indicated below, the amounts in this column represent the cash severance payments that would be payable to each named executive
officer upon a qualifying termination under their respective agreements in connection with the Merger, as described in more detail under “Interests
of Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.” The amounts in this column for Messrs. Eberle and Bowden are anticipated to be
payable in connection with the closing on a “single trigger” basis (i.e., such amounts are payable upon the change in control at closing). The
amounts for Mr. DeLuca are considered “double-trigger” (i.e., such amounts are payable upon a qualifying termination of employment following the
closing). The amount for Mr. Savory represents the amounts payable in connection with a delivery of the transition notice described above. The
cash severance amounts for each named executive officer are calculated as follows:

Under his retention agreement with respect to bonus-related severance payments, Mr. Bowden is entitled to both (1) a severance payment equal to
50% of his annual bonus opportunity for the prior fiscal year (year ending June 30, 2021, annual bonus opportunity of $200,000, resulting in a
payment of $100,000) and (2) a prorated bonus for the fiscal year of termination (year ending June 30, 2022, annual bonus opportunity of $200,000,
resulting in a payment of $183,333).

The amounts in this column represent the estimated pre-tax value to each named executive officer of the vesting of unvested Bottomline restricted
stock held by such named executive officer as of May 31, 2022. The value of Bottomline restricted stock is calculated by multiplying the number of
shares subject to such Bottomline restricted stock by $57.00. The following table breaks down the amounts in this column by the number and value
of awards that will vest upon application of the Additional Vesting Credit and the number and value of awards that will vest as a result of either
contractual single trigger vesting rights or in connection with a subsequent termination of employment (see columns entitled “Additional Shares
Vesting”). For Messrs. Eberle, Bowden, DeLuca and Kelly, all of the displayed amounts (including those under “Additional Shares Vesting”) are
considered “single trigger” as they vest upon a change in control, which change in control will occur upon the closing. For Mr. Savory, the
amounts that represent the value of restricted stock that will vest
61

upon the Additional Vesting Credit are considered “single trigger” as they vest upon a change in control, without regard to the executive’s
termination of service. For additional information on the treatment of outstanding equity awards held by each named executive officer in the
Merger, see “Interests of Bottomline’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

John F. Kelly is party to a Special Advisor and Transition Agreement with Bottomline, under which Mr. Kelly continues to serve as Special Advisor
to Bottomline following the termination of his employment that occurred on August 24, 2021. Mr. Kelly’s stock awards continue to vest under the
agreement through August 24, 2022 and accordingly he will be entitled to the Additional Vesting Credit. Mr. Kelly is not eligible for additional
severance or other payments in connection with the Merger in the event he remains Special Advisor to Bottomline through the closing date.
Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers
For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent has agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which were in existence as of the signing of the Merger Agreement in favor of
the current and former directors or officers of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as provided in their respective governing or organizational documents
and any indemnification or other similar agreements of Bottomline or certain of its subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement to continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, for a period of no less than six years from and after the Effective Time, and
Parent shall cause each of Bottomline and its subsidiaries to perform their obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Effective Time and ending on the date that is the sixth anniversary of the closing date, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation has agreed that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries, or who was as of the date of the Merger, or who thereafter commenced
prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person, against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgements, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
62
Table of Contents
administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger Agreement
and the transactions and actions contemplated thereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person,
whether asserted or claimed at, prior to or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the governing or organizational documents of
Bottomline and its subsidiaries and any indemnification or other similar agreements of Bottomline and any of its subsidiaries. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding, such person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation in effect on the date of the
Merger Agreement; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or
the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such
person is not entitled to indemnification, and the Surviving Corporation will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.
For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for Bottomline and its
subsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage currently
maintained by Bottomline and its subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect
to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to any
annual policy period more than 350% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by Bottomline prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. If the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain such insurance coverage, it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible within such six-year period
for a premium equal to such maximum amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the closing of the Merger, Bottomline may, at its option, purchase a “tail”
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy for Bottomline and its subsidiaries and the insured persons who are currently covered by the directors’
and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Bottomline and its subsidiaries, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than
the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time;
provided that in no event will the cost of any such tail policy exceed the maximum amount described in the preceding sentence. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger will be approximately $2.6 billion, which will be funded via equity financing described
below. This amount includes funds needed to (i) pay our stockholders the amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement, (ii) pay all fees and
expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement and (iii) make payments due as of the Effective Time in respect of our
outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

On December 16, 2021, Parent entered into the Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to which the Thoma Bravo Fund has committed to purchase, or cause
the purchase of, an amount of equity securities of Parent at or immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to the estimated amount of aggregate
consideration that will be due and payable at closing. The Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that Bottomline is an express third
party beneficiary thereof in connection with Bottomline’s exercise of its rights related to specific performance under the Merger Agreement. The Equity

Appraisal Rights",71,71

If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their
shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not
constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a
holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a
beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to
cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our
common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the
other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) continuously are the
record holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and (iii) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their
shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive in lieu of the Per Share Merger Consideration payment in cash of the “fair value” of
the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be
paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its
discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time
through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
such period.
64Table of Contents
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more
than, the same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty days
prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of
Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Bottomline’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and
the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who
wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with
the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her
or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising
the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Bottomline believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should
seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Bottomline a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose
appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no
intention of doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by
proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Bottomline, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the
appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A holder
of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must
continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked,
be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any
previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit
a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal
must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement will not
65
Table of Contents
constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the
Special Meeting of Bottomline’s stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for
appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Bottomline of the
identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares
are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record
owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by
or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on
behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent
is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO
EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A
PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER
OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE
STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
Bottomline Technologies, Inc.
325 Corporate Drive
Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801
Attention: Eric Morgan, Executive Vice President, Global Controller
Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger
Agreement by delivering to Bottomline a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal within 60 days after the Effective Time . However, any such
attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of common stock who has
made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement that the Merger
has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with
Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on
66
Table of Contents
the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all
stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should
not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock.
Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of common
stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights, or
a beneficial owner of shares held in either a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from
the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with
respect to which Bottomline has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must
mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing
statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights
thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of
common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the
judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware
discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air
price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this
determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that
fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc.,
the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
67
Table of Contents
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the
Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder’s
exclusive remedy.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could
be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that
an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to,
and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Bottomline believes that the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, no
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should
recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Neither Bottomline nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each
of Bottomline and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common
stock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of
the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be
appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws,
such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition
for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the
holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of common stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of common
stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time
or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for
appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced
the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",71,75

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that are relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S.
Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock of Bottomline whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the
Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment purposes). This discussion does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or foreign tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., estate or gift taxation) or the
alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax that may be relevant or applicable to a particular holder in connection with the
Merger. For purposes of this discussion, a “holder” means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below) or both, as the context may
require.
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular
circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions or banks; tax-exempt
organizations (including private foundations); S corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; retirement plans; dealers in stocks and securities; traders
in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate
investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
controlled foreign corporations; passive foreign investment companies;
•
holders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax;
•
holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
•
holders that received their shares of common stock in connection with the performance of services;
•
holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Merger;
•
U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
holders that hold or have held, directly or pursuant to attribution rules, more than 5 percent of the shares of common stock of Bottomline at
any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the consummation of the Merger; or
•
holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial
owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors
regarding the consequences of the Merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger described below. No assurance can
be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this
69Table of Contents
discussion, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. Furthermore, no opinion of counsel has been or will be
rendered with respect to any tax considerations of the Merger or any related transactions. The use of words such as “will” and “should” in any tax-
related discussion contained in this discussion is not intended to convey a particular level of comfort.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. EACH
HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR
FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION OR ANY NON-INCOME TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock of Bottomline that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:
•
a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more
United States persons (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or
(2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount
that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S.
Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate generally will apply to long-
term capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder
acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or
loss separately with respect to each block of common stock.
A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding in connection with the Merger. Certain U.S. Holders are exempt from
backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax exempt organizations. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding if such holder fails
to demonstrate an exemption and such holder:
•
fails to furnish the holder’s taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number;
•
furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number; or
•
fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the holder is not
subject to backup withholding.
If a holder does not provide such holder’s correct taxpayer identification number or fails to provide the required certifications, the IRS may impose
penalties on such holder, and the gross proceeds payable to such holder
70
Table of Contents
pursuant to the Merger may be subject to backup withholding at a rate currently equal to 24%. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In general, any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in
which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis at the rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and,
if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty); or
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year in which the Merger is
consummated, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty), net of applicable U.S.-source capital losses recognized by such Non-U.S. Holder.
Payments made to Non-U.S. Holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding. Non-U.S. Holders generally can
avoid backup withholding and information reporting by providing the paying agent with the applicable and properly executed IRS Form W-8 (or an
appropriate substitute or successor form) certifying the holder’s non-U.S. status or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns
that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the
country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or credit against a
Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to any applicable tax treaties that might provide for different rules.
THE FOREGOING SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO
PARTICULAR HOLDERS. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO
THEM OF THE RECEIPT OF CASH FOR THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER UNDER ANY U.S. FEDERAL,

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Bottomline and Parent file a notification and report form
with the FTC and the DOJ under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR
Act may not be completed until the expiration of waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a 30-
day period) or the early termination of that waiting period. Bottomline and Parent made the necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of
the DOJ on December 30, 2021. The required waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on January
31, 2022. Accordingly, the condition of the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act as described below under the
caption “—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” has been satisfied.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ
could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.
U.K. Change in Control Matters
Bottomline Payment Services Limited (a U.K. based subsidiary of Bottomline) is authorized and regulated by the FCA. Accordingly, any person who will
acquire a “qualifying holding” in Bottomline Payment Services Limited as a result of the consummation of the Merger, which will include Parent and other
members of its group, will require approval from the FCA for the change in control.
Parent submitted a change in control application with the FCA on January 20, 2022. Following submission of the change in control application by,
amongst others, the Parent, the FCA has 60 working days (or up to 90 working days if the FCA require further information) to decide either to (i) approve
the Merger unconditionally; (ii) approve the Merger subject to conditions, for instance, preventing Parent or a connected party from taking up
directorships and from exercising their voting powers over certain matters related to Bottomline Payment Services Limited; or (iii) object to the Merger
entirely. However, over the past year such applications have been experiencing increasingly severe delays and the FCA may take many weeks before it
acknowledges receipt of the completed application and allocates it to a case officer for review; the statutory review period set out above will only
commence thereafter.
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals
and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which
actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to
obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time
between the approval by Bottomline’s stockholders and the completion of the Merger.

Table of Contents
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and
approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

On January 19, 2022, a purported stockholder of Bottomline filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against
Bottomline and its directors, captioned Shiva Stein v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00481 (the “Stein Complaint”). On January
21, 2022, a purported stockholder of Bottomline filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Bottomline
and its directors, captioned Jeffrey D. Justice, II v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00586 (the “Justice Complaint”). On January 26,
2022, a purported stockholder of Bottomline filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Bottomline
and its directors, captioned Chau Le v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00670 (the “Le Complaint”).
All of the complaints allege that the preliminary proxy statement issued in connection with the Merger omits material information or contains misleading
disclosures and that, as a result, (i) all of the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and (ii) all of Bottomline’s directors violated section
20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Le Complaint also alleges that Bottomline’s directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and good faith by,
among other things, causing Bottomline to enter into the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as a result of an inadequate sale process,
agreeing to preclusive deal mechanisms and filing a materially misleading and incomplete preliminary proxy statement. The Le Complaint also alleges that
Bottomline aided and abetted these purported breaches of fiduciary duties.
All of the complaints seek, among other things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (ii) rescission or rescissory damages in the event the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been implemented; (iii)
dissemination of a proxy statement that does not omit material information or contain any misleading disclosures; (iv) a declaration that defendants
violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act (except the Stein Complaint and the Le Complaint) or that Bottomline’s directors violated their
fiduciary duties (except the Stein Complaint and the Justice Complaint); (v) to direct the defendants to account to plaintiff for all damages suffered (except
the Justice Complaint); and (vi) an award of plaintiff’s expenses, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees.
Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub believe the claims asserted in each of the complaints are without merit.
Additional lawsuits may be filed against Bottomline, the Board of Directors, Parent and/or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement and the Proxy Statement.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and
elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to
this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and
in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations
of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy
statement. Capitalized terms used in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of
the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to
important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those
generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger
Sub by Bottomline in connection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger
Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be
subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries
under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Bottomline, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you
should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub,
because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as
otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described
below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual
information regarding Bottomline, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our
filings with the SEC regarding Bottomline and our business.

Common Stock
At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares owned by (1) Parent or Merger Sub; (2) any subsidiary of the
Company; and (3) stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration (which is $57.00 per share, less any applicable withholding taxes) without interest. All shares converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration will no longer be outstanding and automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time and the holders of such
shares will cease to have any rights thereto, except for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Outstanding Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that Bottomline’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the
following treatment at the Effective Time:
•
Additional Vesting Credit. Immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time, (1) for any unvested restricted stock
award or unvested restricted stock unit award the vesting of which is conditioned upon both time-based vesting and the attainment of
performance conditions and that remains outstanding and subject to such performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the number of shares of common stock subject to such unvested restricted stock award or unvested restricted stock unit
award will be fixed at the Effective Time based upon the target level of performance, and (2) each outstanding unvested stock option and
each outstanding unvested restricted stock award and unvested restricted stock unit award will be credited with the Additional Vesting
Credit. The Additional Vesting Credit includes the 12 months of “change in control” accelerated vesting provided in Bottomline’s 2019 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended and is without limitation of any more favorable vesting provisions in any other plan or agreement between
Bottomline and any employee.
•
Options. Each option that is vested and outstanding will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable
tax withholding) equal to the product of (1) the excess of $57.00 over the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such stock
option; and (2) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such option.
75Table of Contents
•
Restricted Stock Awards. As of the Effective Time, the portion of each restricted stock award which is vested (after giving effect to the
Additional Vesting Credit), will be converted into the right to receive the product of (i) $57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
common stock subject to such restricted stock award. Each other outstanding restricted stock award will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) $57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common
stock subject to such restricted stock award, which amount will, generally be subject to the holder’s continued service with Bottomline,
Parent or an affiliate through the applicable vesting date, vest and be payable at the same time and on the same terms (except as described
below) as the restricted stock award for which such amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (after giving effect to
the Additional Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, if the holder’s employment is terminated other
than for cause or by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective Time, the vesting conditions with respect to any unpaid
unvested restricted stock award will be satisfied as of the holder’s last day of employment.
•
Restricted Stock Unit Awards. As of the Effective Time, the portion of each restricted stock unit award which is vested (after giving effect to
the Additional Vesting Credit), will be converted into the right to receive a payment equal to the product of (i) $57.00, multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award. Each other outstanding award will be cancelled and
converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) $57.00, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award, which amount will, generally be subject to the holder’s continued
service with Bottomline, Parent or an affiliate through the applicable vesting date, vest and be payable through the applicable payroll
system(s) of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries at the same time and on the same terms (except as described below) as the
restricted stock unit to which such cash amount relates would have vested pursuant to its terms (after giving effect to the Additional
Vesting Credit). Additionally, under Bottomline’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, if the holder’s employment is terminated other than for cause or
by the holder for good reason within two years of the Effective Time, the vesting conditions with respect to any unpaid unvested restricted
stock unit award will be satisfied as of the holder’s last day of employment.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a bank, trust or transfer agent company reasonably acceptable to Bottomline, which institution we refer to
as the “paying agent,” to make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration to stockholders. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
deposit with the paying agent cash constituting an amount equal to the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable to stockholders (other than
any merger consideration in respect of any dissenting shares).
As reasonably promptly as practicable (but no later than the third business day) after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to
each holder of record of Bottomline common stock (other than Bottomline, its subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub) a form of letter of transmittal together
with instructions thereto. Upon receipt of (i) in the case of shares of Bottomline common stock represented by a stock certificate, a surrendered certificate
or certificates in respect of such shares together with the signed letter of transmittal or (ii) in the case of shares of Bottomline common stock held in book-
entry form, the receipt of an “agent’s message” by the paying agent, and in each case, together with such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the paying agent, the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. The amount
of any Per Share Merger Consideration paid to the stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any stock certificate or shares of stock held in book-entry form.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent remains undistributed to holders of Bottomline common stock one (1) year after the Effective Time, such cash
(including any interest received with respect thereto) will be
76Table of Contents
delivered to Parent or its designee, and any holder of Bottomline common stock who has not complied with the exchange procedures in the Merger
Agreement will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general unsecured creditor thereof for payment of its claim for the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.
If any stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that
fact by the person claiming such stock certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (and if required by Parent, the posting of such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such stock certificate), the paying
agent will, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate, pay the Per Share Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to the Merger Agreement.",83,84

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of Bottomline, Parent and Merger Sub.
Bottomline
Certain of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by Bottomline are qualified as to “materiality” or “Company Material
Adverse Effect.” “Company Material Adverse Effect” means any fact, circumstance, occurrence, effect, change, event or development that, individually
or in the aggregate, has or would reasonably be expected to (i) have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or condition (financial
or otherwise) of Bottomline and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (ii) prevent or materially impair, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The foregoing notwithstanding, none of the following will be taken into
account in determining whether such Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred for purposes of clause (i) of the prior sentence:
•
conditions affecting the United States economy, or any other national or regional economy or the global economy generally;
•
political conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism or epidemics,
pandemics or natural disasters (including any escalation or general worsening or any improvement or diminution of any of the foregoing) in
the United States or any other country or region of the world;
•
changes in the financial, credit, banking or securities markets in the United States or any other country or region in the world (including any
disruption thereof and any decline in the price of any security or any market index);
•
changes required by GAAP or other accounting standards (or interpretation or enforcement thereof), in each case after the date of the
Merger Agreement;
•
changes in any laws or orders issued by any governmental entity (or interpretation or enforcement thereof), in each case after the date of
the Merger Agreement;
•
changes generally affecting the industries in which Bottomline and its subsidiaries operate;
•
any failure by Bottomline to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions or any decline in the
market price or trading volume of Bottomline’s common stock (provided that the underlying causes of any such failure or decline may be
considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred to the extent not otherwise excluded by another
exception therein);
•
the negotiation, execution or delivery of the Merger Agreement, the performance by any party thereto of its obligations thereunder or the
public announcement (including as to the identity of the parties
77Table of Contents
thereto) or pendency of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated thereby; provided that this exception will not apply to
any representation or warranty contained in the Merger Agreement to the extent that such representation or warranty expressly addresses
consequences resulting from the execution of the Merger Agreement or the consummation or pendency of the Merger;
•
any suit, action or other proceeding commenced or, to the knowledge of Bottomline, threatened against Bottomline or its current or former
directors or officers by any stockholder of Bottomline relating to, arising out of or involving the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any suit, action or other proceeding relating to dissenting shares; or
•
any action expressly required by the terms of the Merger Agreement, or taken with the express prior written consent or at the express
written direction of Parent.
However, in the case of the exclusions set forth in bullets 1 through 6 immediately above, to the extent any fact, circumstance, occurrence, effect, change,
event or development arising from or related to such exclusions materially disproportionately affects Bottomline and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
relative to other companies of similar size in the industries in which Bottomline and its subsidiaries operate, only the incremental disproportionate effect
may be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred.
In the Merger Agreement, Bottomline has made customary representations and warranties to Parent and Merger Sub that are subject, in some cases, to
specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement. These representations and warranties relate to, among other things:
•
due organization, valid existence, good standing and authority and qualification to conduct business with respect to Bottomline and its
subsidiaries;
•
the capital structure of Bottomline or Bottomline’s ownership of its subsidiaries;

through the date of the Merger Agreement;

Parent and Merger Sub
Certain of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by Parent and Merger Sub are qualified as to a “Parent Material Adverse
Effect.” “Parent Material Adverse Effect” means with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, any fact, circumstance, occurrence, effect, change, event or
development that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impair, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
In the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have made customary representations and warranties to Bottomline that are subject, in some cases, to

required or contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (3) as required in order to not be in violation of any applicable law; or (4) with the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), during the period of time between the signing of the
Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger Agreement, Bottomline will, and will cause each of its
subsidiaries to:
•

of full or partial suspension of operations related to the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bottomline and its subsidiaries may, in
connection with the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, take such actions as are reasonably necessary to protect the health and safety
of their employees and other individuals having business dealings with Bottomline and its subsidiaries or respond to third-party supply or
service disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in a commercially reasonable manner; provided that, unless doing so is impracticable
due to emergency or urgent circumstances, Bottomline will provide reasonable advance notice to and reasonably consult with Parent prior
to taking any action that would be otherwise prohibited or restricted by the covenants described under this heading); and

prohibit the counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors in compliance with the Merger Agreement and (ii)

accordance with its terms, would result in such person or group beneficially owning more than 20% of the company common stock
outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange offer; (ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other
acquisition by any person or group, or stockholders of any such person or group, of more than 20% of the consolidated assets of

or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, or changes after the date of the Merger Agreement
in the market price or trading volume of the company common stock or the credit rating of Bottomline (it being understood that the
underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (ii) may be considered and taken into account); and
•

and other aspects of such proposal that the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) considers relevant and any revisions to the Merger

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the holders of shares of
Bottomline common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors may
not effect a Company Board Recommendation Change except as described below.
The Board of Directors may not (with any action described in the following being referred to as an “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, its recommendation that stockholders
vote in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;
•
adopt, approve or recommend to Bottomline’s stockholders an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm its recommendation that stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement within seven
business days after Parent so requests in writing; or
•
fail to include its recommendation that stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger in this
proxy statement.
Prior to the Special Meeting, and notwithstanding the restrictions described above in “ — Acquisition Proposals,” the Board of Directors is permitted in
certain circumstances, and subject to Bottomline’s compliance with certain obligations (as summarized below), to (i) make a Company Board
Recommendation Change, and (ii) terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the company stockholder approval:
•
the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (other than in response to an
Acquisition Proposal) in response to an Intervening Event if the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; provided that the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) may not effect such a Company Board Recommendation
Change unless:
•
Bottomline has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance to the effect that the Board of Directors
(or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change, including a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances related thereto;
and
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, Bottomline and its representatives have negotiated with Parent and
its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter in such a manner that would obviate the need to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change; or

respects with its obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, cause Bottomline to terminate
the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; provided
that the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) may not take any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) unless:

the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) intends to take the actions described in clauses (A) or (B) above, including the identity of
the person or group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all material relevant agreements
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination,
Bottomline and its representatives, during the applicable notice period, must have negotiated with Parent and its representatives in
good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination; provided, that none of Bottomline, any of its affiliates or any of their respective
representatives may disclose to any other person the terms or other information with respect to any offer of, or negotiations with,

consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter) will have determined that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be
a Superior Proposal, and in the case of a Company Board Recommendation Change, that the failure to effect such Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, the Merger Agreement does not prohibit Bottomline or the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof)
from (i) taking and disclosing to Bottomline’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making a customary “stop-look-and-

incentive compensation or other cash- or equity-based long-term incentive compensation opportunities, defined benefit pension, retiree or post-

to such employee immediately prior to the closing date. For a period of one year following the closing date, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or
one of its affiliates to provide severance benefits to continuing employees who incur a termination of employment during such period that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits to which such employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination under the severance policies of
Bottomline and its subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of
its affiliates to grant any continuing employee credit for such continuing employees’ service with Bottomline for purposes of eligibility and determination
of the level of vacation benefits and severance benefits, but not for purposes of benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans, under
corresponding benefit plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which a continuing employee participates to the same extent and for
the same purpose as recognized by Bottomline under the applicable Bottomline employee benefit plan immediately prior to the closing date; provided,

For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent has agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which were in existence as of the signing of the Merger Agreement in favor of
the current and former directors or officers of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as provided in their respective governing or

and after the Effective Time and ending on the date that is the sixth anniversary of the closing date, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and
the Surviving Corporation has agreed that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries, or who was as of the date of the Merger, or who
thereafter commenced prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person,
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgements, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
thereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving
at the request of Bottomline or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person, whether asserted or claimed at, prior to or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the governing or organizational documents of Bottomline and its subsidiaries and any indemnification
or other similar agreements of Bottomline and any of its subsidiaries. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, such person will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement; provided that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation
or bylaws to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification, and the Surviving
Corporation will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.
For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for Bottomline and its
subsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage currently
maintained by Bottomline and its subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect
to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to any
annual policy period more than 350% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by Bottomline prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. If the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain such insurance coverage, it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible within such six-year period
for a premium equal to such maximum amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the closing of the Merger, Bottomline may, at its option, purchase a “tail”
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy for Bottomline and its subsidiaries and the insured persons who are currently covered by the directors’
and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Bottomline and its subsidiaries, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than
the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by Bottomline or its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time;
provided that in no event will the cost of any such tail policy exceed the maximum amount described in the preceding sentence. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, if (i) Bottomline has complied in all material respects with its

pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (iii) Bottomline has delivered irrevocable written notice to Parent certifying as to the matters
described in clause (i) and that Bottomline stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger at such time, and (iv) Parent and

other party or parties specifying the provisions of the Merger Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and, upon the valid termination of

any intentional common law fraud or any willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement prior to or in connection with such termination. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, without in any way limiting Bottomline’s rights under the Merger Agreement but subject to the parent liability
limitation (in the amount equal to $195,000,000), recoverable damages of Bottomline under the Merger Agreement are not limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and include the benefit of the bargain lost by the equityholders of Bottomline (including “lost premium”), taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to Bottomline’s equityholders under the Merger Agreement and the time value of

The following table sets forth information, as of January 24, 2022, regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock by (a) each person or
entity known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (b) each of the “named executive officers,” (c) each

named executive officers is c/o Bottomline Technologies, Inc., 325 Corporate Drive, Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we sometimes refer to as the SEC, and
generally includes voting power and/or investment power with respect to securities. As of January 24, 2022 there were 44,980,651 shares of our common
stock outstanding. Shares of common stock subject to options currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of January 24, 2022 are deemed
outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage beneficially owned by the person or entity holding the options, but are not deemed outstanding
for purposes of computing the percentage beneficially owned by any other person or entity. All unvested time-based and performance-based restricted
stock awards are included in each holder’s beneficial ownership as holders are entitled to voting rights upon issuance of the restricted stock awards.
Except as indicated by footnote, we believe that the persons and entities named in this table, based on information provided by them, have sole voting

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of stockholders of
Bottomline. However, if the Merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
Bottomline will hold an annual meeting in 2022 only if the Merger has not already been completed.
Stockholders interested in submitting a proposal (other than the nomination of directors) for inclusion in the proxy materials to be distributed by us for
the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, if held, may do so by following the procedures prescribed in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. Any proposal that
a stockholder intends to present at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders must be submitted to our principal executive offices at 325 Corporate Drive,
Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801, Attention: Corporate Secretary, no later than June 23, 2022 in order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy
statement and proxy card relating to the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of our 2022 annual meeting is prior to October 19, 2022
or after December 18, 2022, the deadline is 10 business days before we begin to print and mail our proxy materials for the 2022 annual meeting.
If a stockholder wishes to present a proposal at the 2022 annual meeting but has not complied with the requirements for inclusion of the proposal in our
proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, the stockholder must also give notice of the proposal to our corporate secretary at our
principal executive offices. Our second amended and restated by-laws require that we be given advance written notice of stockholder nominations
regarding election to our Board of Directors and certain other matters which stockholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of stockholders
(other than matters included in our proxy statement discussed above). We must receive this notice at least 60 days, but not more than 90 days, prior to
the date of the 2022 annual meeting, which is expected to be November 17, 2022; provided that if less than 70 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the
date of the meeting is given to stockholders, such notice must instead be received no later than the tenth day following the date on which the notice of
the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever occurs first. Our bylaws also specify requirements relating to the content of the
notice which stockholders must provide, including for stockholder nominations for director, in order for such proposals or nominations to be properly
presented at a stockholder meeting.

ARTICLE II
EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES
Section 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) or shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub Common Stock”):
(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation, other than shares of the Surviving Corporation issued pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(ii). From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(b) Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of Subsidiary-Owned Stock.
(i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Company Subsidiary or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub shall be converted into such number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.
A-2
Table of Contents
(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.02 and 2.03, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or converted into shares of the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive $57.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Without limiting the restrictions set forth in Section 5.01, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or
amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.
Section 2.02 Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund.
(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, appoint a bank, trust or transfer agent company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for
payment in accordance with this Article II through the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (other than any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares). All such cash deposited with the Paying Agent is
hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund.”
(b) Letter of Transmittal. As reasonably promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub) a form of letter of transmittal (the “Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall be in such form and have such other
provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an “agent’s message” with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may specify subject to the Company’s reasonable approval, and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions thereto.
(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an
“agent’s message” by the Paying Agent, in each case together with such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such
Company Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at
any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holders of
A-3
Table of Contents
shares of Company Common Stock are entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).
(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II
upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are
presented to Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a
general unsecured creditor thereof for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.
(f) No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates (including Sponsor
and its Affiliates) shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(g) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; provided, that
such investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the
Law of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers’ acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or
in mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent.
No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the Company’s shareholders to receive the
Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund
diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.
(h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and their Affiliates, as
applicable (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and
duly paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.
(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent, the posting
of such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
A-4

(j) No Further Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or shares in book-entry form.
Section 2.03 Dissenting Shares.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, but the
holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to all limitations and
requirements set forth therein; provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), such holder’s shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.
(b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments, notices or demands served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal
demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.
Section 2.04 Treatment of Company Stock Awards and Company ESPP.
(a) Additional Vesting Credit. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to provide that immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time, (1) for any Unvested Company Restricted Stock
Award or Unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award the vesting of which is conditioned upon both time-based vesting and the attainment of
performance conditions and that remains outstanding and subject to such performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Restricted Stock Award or Unvested Company Restricted Stock
Unit Award shall be fixed at the Effective Time based upon target levels of performance, and (2) each outstanding Unvested Company Stock Option and
each outstanding Unvested Company Restricted Stock Award and Unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award (including those described in clause
(1)) shall be credited with an additional 30 months of time-based vesting credit (measured from the Closing Date) (the “Additional Vesting Credit”), and
the Additional Vesting Credit shall apply both for purposes of the treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award under this Section 2.04 and for purposes of determining the timing of vesting and payment for any Cash Replacement Option
Amount any Cash Replacement Restricted Stock Amount for any Unvested Company Stock Option or Unvested Company Restricted Stock Award. The
parties agree that the Additional Vesting Credit above both (A) includes the 12 months of “change in control” accelerated vesting provided in the
Company’s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended by Amendment No. 1 approved by the Company Board effective October 14, 2020, and (B) is without

(i) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding, vested (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit) and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Vested Company Stock Option”) shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, payable as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time equal to the product of (i) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration, over (B) the per share exercise price of such Vested Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Stock Option (subject to any required withholding under applicable Tax Law).
Each Vested Company Stock Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at
the Effective Time without the payment of consideration therefor.
(ii) Each outstanding Company Stock Option that is not a Vested Company Stock Option (an “Unvested Company Stock Option”)
shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration, over (B) the per share exercise price of such Unvested Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Stock Option (the “Cash Replacement Option Amount”), which

vesting date, vest and be payable through the applicable payroll system(s) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (subject to any
required withholding under applicable Tax Law) at the same time and on the same terms as the Unvested Company Stock Option for which such
Cash Replacement Option Amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit).

Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(c) of this Agreement.
(ii) Each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award that is not an Accelerated Company Restricted Stock Award (an “Unvested
Company Restricted Stock Award”) shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested
Company Restricted Stock Award (the “Cash Replacement Restricted Stock Amount”), which Cash Replacement Restricted Stock Amount will,
subject to the holder’s continued service with the Company, Parent or an Affiliate through the applicable vesting date, vest and be payable
through the applicable payroll system(s) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries at the same time and on the same terms (except as
otherwise provided herein) as the Unvested Company Restricted Stock Award for which such Cash Replacement Restricted Stock Amount was
exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit).
(d) Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:
(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, the portion of each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award which is vested (after giving effect to
the Additional Vesting Credit) (each, an “Accelerated Company Restricted Stock Unit Award”), shall be converted into the right to receive a
payment equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the award, multiplied by the Merger Consideration.
A-6

“Unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award”) shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award (the “Cash Replacement Restricted Stock Unit Amount”), which Cash Replacement
Restricted Stock Unit Amount will, subject to the holder’s continued service with the Company, Parent or an Affiliate through the applicable
vesting date, vest and be payable through the applicable payroll system(s) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries at the same time and
on the same terms (except as otherwise provided herein) as the Unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award for which such Cash Replacement
Restricted Stock Unit Amount was exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (after giving effect to the Additional Vesting Credit).
(e) Payment for Company Stock Awards. Any amounts payable with respect to any Vested Company Stock Options, Accelerated Company
Restricted Stock Award or Accelerated Company Restricted Stock Unit Award pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i), 2.04(c)(i) or 2.04(d)(i) shall be made through
the applicable payroll system(s) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries no later than the earlier of (i) ten (10) Business Days after the Effective
Time and (ii) the first regularly scheduled payroll date after the Effective Time. Any payments made with respect to a Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award (whether payable pursuant to this Section 2.04(e) or otherwise) shall, to the extent the Company Restricted Stock Unit Award is subject to Section
409A of the Code, be paid at the earliest time such payment may be made without resulting in a violation of Section 409A of the Code, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary.
(f) Further Actions. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action necessary to effect the cancellation and
exchange, as applicable, of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards upon the

Bravo XV, L.P. (the “Sponsor”), dated as of the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto as of the date of this
Agreement, the “Equity Commitment Letter”) pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Sponsor has committed to invest
the amounts set forth therein (the “Equity Financing”). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that the Company is an
express limited third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter, as set forth therein. As of the date of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, and the Sponsor, enforceable in accordance with its terms. As of the
date of this agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, and the respective commitments or obligations thereunder, have not been withdrawn, terminated,
repudiated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment,
supplement or modification is contemplated. Neither Parent nor Sponsor has committed any breach of the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
covenants, conditions or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, the Equity Commitment Letter, and no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute or result in a breach or default on the
part of either Parent or Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) constitute or result in a failure of either Parent or Sponsor to satisfy, or delay in
satisfaction of, any of the terms or conditions or other contingencies set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, (iii) make any of the assumptions or any
of the statements set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Equity
Financing not being available as of the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a
timely basis (and in any event, not later than the Closing), any condition precedent to be satisfied by it (or otherwise within Parent’s, any Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives’ or Affiliates’ control) contained in the Equity Commitment Letter or that the full amounts
committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter will not be available as of the Closing if the conditions precedent to be satisfied by it (or otherwise
within Parent’s, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective Representatives’ or Affiliates’ control) contained in the Equity Commitment Letter are
satisfied. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies or conditions related to the Equity Financing other than those conditions set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by
the Equity Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing
Date. The aggregate proceeds from the Equity Financing constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and are sufficient in amount to provide Parent with the funds necessary for it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, including for Parent to pay (or cause to be paid) the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to Article II
on the Closing Date and the payment of all fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Parent related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including such fees, costs and expenses relating to the Equity Financing, and payment of all amounts in connection with the refinancing or repayment of
any outstanding indebtedness (including the Company Credit Agreement Payoff Amount) of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries required by this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that their obligations under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding Parent’s, Merger Sub’s or any other Person’s ability to obtain equity or debt financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, that the foregoing representation and warranty shall not limit the express conditions set

funded and to consummate the Merger and (B) paragraph 6 of the Equity Commitment Letter required in order for the Company, as an express third-party
beneficiary, to enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against the Sponsor as if the Company were a party thereto.
Section 3.05 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company’s shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to

and shall not instruct, authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, propose or

permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) if, and only if, the Company Board (or a
A-30
Table of Contents
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so (i) would
prohibit the counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board in compliance with this Section 5.04 and (ii) would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the time
of the Company’s receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that was not the
result of a material breach of Section 5.04(a) and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of
their Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the

Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or (D) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within seven (7) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (any action described in clauses (A) through (D), a “Company
Board Recommendation Change”); provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (2) the public disclosure by the Company of such determination or the
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; or (3) the delivery by the Company of any notice contemplated by Section 5.04(d) will, in and of itself,
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval:
(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (other than in response to an
Acquisition Proposal) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change
unless:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance to the effect that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify the basis
for such Company Board Recommendation Change, including a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating
thereto; and
A-31
Table of Contents
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives, during such four-
Business Day period, has negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to
enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter in such a manner
that would obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B) provided that the Company has complied in all material
respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.04 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not take any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) unless:
(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
(2) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent four Business Days in advance (it being understood that any
material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms or conditions of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a
new Superior Proposal and shall require a new notice but with a two-Business Day (instead of four-Business Day) period from the date of
such notice) (any such notice period, the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to take the
actions described in clauses (A) or (B) of Section 5.04(d)(ii), including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all material relevant agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice Period,
must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter in such a manner that would
obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or termination; provided, that neither the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives may disclose to any other Person the terms or other information with respect to any
offer of, or negotiations with, Parent pursuant to this Section 5.04(d)(ii)(2) unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to such offer
or negotiations is executed; and
(3) following any Notice Period, including any subsequent Notice Period, pursuant to the foregoing Section 5.04(d)(ii)(2), the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account
Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter) shall have determined that
the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, and in the case of a Company Board Recommendation Change, that the
failure to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.
(e) From the time this Agreement is executed until the earlier to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and
the Effective Time, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal
or any Inquiries are received by the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or Group making such
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiries; (ii) the material terms and conditions of such offers or proposals; and (iii) if available, copies of any written materials
relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of
the status and material change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiries, offers or proposals (including any material amendments
thereto) and the status of any related substantive discussions or negotiations. The Company
A-32

shall notify Parent that it has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with any Person within 24 hours after the execution thereof.
(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from taking and
disclosing to the Company’s shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), making a customary “stop-look-and-listen”
communication to the Company’s shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication) or from making any
legally required disclosure to the Company’s shareholders pursuant to applicable securities Laws with regard to the transactions contemplated hereby or
an Acquisition Proposal; provided that the foregoing shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that such disclosure would otherwise have under this
Agreement.
(g) The Company agrees that any material breach of this Section 5.04 by any of its Representatives (acting as such) will be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company.
ARTICLE VI
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
Section 6.01 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders Meeting.
(a) As reasonably promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later than 20 Business Days
thereafter), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement to be sent to the Company’s shareholders relating to the
Company Shareholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”). Parent shall furnish all information
concerning Parent and its Affiliates to the Company, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall reasonably promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, related to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as reasonably promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and
Parent will cooperate in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement or response (including the proposed final version of the Proxy Statement or response) and (ii) shall consider
in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent.
(b) If prior to the Effective Time any change occurs with respect to information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent shall reasonably promptly notify the Company of
such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, and as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company’s shareholders.
Nothing in this Section 6.01(b) shall limit the obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).
(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall reasonably promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company shall as reasonably
A-33
Table of Contents
promptly as practicable file any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement with the SEC and, as required by Law, disseminate the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company’s shareholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(c) shall limit the obligations of any
party under Section 6.01(a).
(d) The Company shall, as reasonably promptly as practicable after the SEC Clearance Date, duly call, establish a record date for, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of (i) seeking the Company Shareholder Approval; and (ii) in accordance with

for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection
with the completion of the Merger. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), the foregoing shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the holders of
Company Common Stock at the Company Shareholders Meeting. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall (i) file the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s shareholders as of the record date established for the
Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable (and in any event within seven (7) Business Days) after the date on which the SEC confirms
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (the “SEC Clearance Date”); provided that if the SEC has failed to affirmatively notify the
Company within ten (10) calendar days after the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement,
then such date shall be the “SEC Clearance Date”; and (ii) subject to Section 5.04, use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the Company Shareholder
Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval (the
“Company Recommendation”) and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, in each case, except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have made a Company Board Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.04(d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting only (i) with the consent of Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) for the
absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good
faith is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company’s
shareholders prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting or following an order or request from the SEC or (iv) to allow additional solicitation of votes in
order to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval; provided that the Company will not postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting on
more than two occasions without the prior written consent of Parent. Once the Company has established the record date for the Company Shareholders
Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required
to do so by applicable Law. In the event that the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or
postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing, it shall implement such adjournment or
postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting, as so
adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable Law. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the
Company shall submit this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting, even if the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.
Section 6.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to,
afford to Parent and the Representatives of Parent reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective properties, books and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and its Representatives (A) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request for any reasonable business purposes, including related to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any material respect with the normal business operations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary) and (B) to the extent available for the period beginning
A-34
Table of Contents
after the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, as soon as practicable after the end of each month, and in any event within thirty (30)
days thereafter, a copy of the monthly consolidated financial statements of the Company, including statements of financial condition, results of
operations and statements of cash flow; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the
extent it determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure or access would (a) violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement
or other Contract with a third party (provided that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to such access or disclosure or implement appropriate procedures to enable the disclosure of such information); (b) result in the loss of any
attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (c) violate any Law (provided that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate Law). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 to the extent such
access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of November 11, 2021, between Thoma Bravo, L.P. and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).
Section 6.03 Efforts to Consummate.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
use their respective reasonable best efforts to reasonably promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as reasonably promptly as practicable after
the date hereof and in any event no later than the End Date the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing as reasonably
promptly as practicable all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests and other documents and to obtain as reasonably promptly
as practicable all Consents necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, the “Governmental Approvals”) and (ii) as reasonably promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be necessary to
obtain all such Governmental Approvals, provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent to agree to invest any additional capital in the
Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing or otherwise take any action or commit to take any action or agree to any condition or restriction that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities or operations of Parent or its Affiliates, taken as a
whole. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate and complete filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, (B) make all other required filings pursuant to other Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably

or enter into any agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) or the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) or any other
Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto. Each of Parent and the Company shall make an appropriate response as reasonably promptly as practicable to any request for any additional
information or documentation pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law

A-35

other Regulatory Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any communication, filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) subject to any duty of confidentiality which either party may
owe to any Governmental Entity or any duty of privacy to any individual, keep the other party and/or its counsel informed of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or other Governmental Entity and of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) consult
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other person, give the
other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; and (iv) permit the other party and/or its
counsel to review in advance any submission, filing or communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be given by it to the FTC, the
DOJ or any other Governmental Entity (with the exception of any initial filing pursuant to the HSR Act); provided that (A) materials may be redacted (i)
for privilege or (ii) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and (B) nothing in
this Section 6.03(b) shall require Parent to share any materials to be provided to the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in connection with obtaining
Governmental Approvals or to consult with the Company in connection with any communications with the FCA. Parent and the Company may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other under this Section 6.03(b) as
“Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Section 6.04 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.
(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
governing or organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries set forth
on Section 6.04 of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, for a period of no less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to perform its obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time and ending on the date
that is the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will,
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time,
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (the “Company Indemnified Parties”),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and
disbursements (“Losses”), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under governing or organizational documents and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries set forth on Section 6.04 of the Company Disclosure
Letter. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in
A-36
Table of Contents
the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation as in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if
and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents), to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.
(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or provide substitute
policies for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’
and officers’ insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage
and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (with insurance
carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to any annual policy period more than 350% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid
by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Maximum Amount”), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance
required by this Section 6.04(b) it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible within such six (6)-year period for a premium equal to the
Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option, purchase a “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policy for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the insured persons who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than
the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time; provided that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.04 (i) shall survive consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.
Section 6.05 Transaction Litigation. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed, but only to the extent that doing so would
not, in the reasonable judgement of the Company’s legal counsel, jeopardize attorney-client privilege regarding any suit, action or other proceeding
commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or its current or former directors or officers by any shareholder of the
Company relating to, arising out of or involving this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby (“Transaction
Litigation”). The Company shall (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and
(b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense and settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall not compromise or settle any such Transaction
Litigation unless Parent shall have consented thereto (which consent shall not be

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.05, any suit, action or other proceeding
relating to Dissenting Shares shall be governed by Section 2.03.
Section 6.06 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such further actions, if any, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including any derivative securities and Company Stock Awards)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Section 6.07 Public Announcements. Except with respect to any Company Board Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal or related matters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any rule of or listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system (in which case the disclosing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party prior to such disclosure). The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall limit the ability of
(i) any party hereto to make internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent in all material respects with the prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) Parent to make disclosures or communications to existing or prospective
general or limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of Parent or its Affiliates; provided that such Persons are subject to
customary confidentiality restrictions.
Section 6.08 Employment and Company Benefits.
(a) During the one (1)-year period immediately following the Closing Date or, if earlier, the date of the Company Employee’s termination
employment, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates to provide to each Company Employee (i) at least the same aggregate
base salary and target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) other
compensation and employee benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based incentive compensation or other cash- or equity-based
long-term incentive compensation opportunities, defined benefit pension, retiree or post-employment welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation)
that, are substantially similar in the aggregate to such compensation and benefits provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.
“Company Employee” means any employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who is employed at the Closing Date and who remains
employed with the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of Parent immediately following the Closing.
(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates to provide each Company Employee who incurs a termination of
employment during the one (1)-year period immediately following the Closing Date with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits to which such employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination under the applicable Company Benefit Plan listed on Section
6.08(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter that is designated as a severance policy of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement
(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates to give Company Employees credit for such Company Employees’
service with the Company for purposes of eligibility and determination of the level of benefits vacation and severance benefits, but not for purposes of
benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans, under the corresponding benefit plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
A-38

in which a Company Employee participates to the same extent and for the same purpose as recognized by the Company under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Section 6.08(b)).
(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations
otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates that provides health benefits
in which Company Employees participate following the Closing, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the
Closing Date under the analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Employees and their eligible dependents and credited under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the
portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding
health plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred; and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent
such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing Date.
(e) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any Company Employee or any other employee of the Company, Parent,
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates to continued employment by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to
continue any Company Benefit Plans or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Closing Date; (iii) confer upon any

respective officers or employees shall be obligated to cooperate with a “high-yield” bond financing, and (y) such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries). Such cooperation by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries may include, at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) causing appropriate senior officers to participate in a reasonable number of meetings and

authorization letters, or the bank information memoranda in which such letters are included, shall include language that exculpates the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective representatives and Affiliates from any liability in connection with the unauthorized use by the recipients
thereof of the information set forth in any such bank information memoranda or similar memoranda or report distributed in connection therewith) and
other reasonable and customary closing certificates (including a solvency certificate) and other definitive financing documentation required in

extent in the possession of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and (ix) delivering notices of prepayment for the repayment in full of the Company
Credit Agreement Payoff Amount to the extent required under the terms of the Company Credit Agreement (which notices may be conditioned on the

contrary, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any officer, employee or representative of any of the foregoing, shall be required to (A)

manner that is not intended, or that is not reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company or the Company’s reputation or goodwill. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries will be deemed to be in compliance with this Section 6.10(a), and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall allege that the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is or has not been in compliance with this Section 6.10(a), unless the Debt Financing (if any) has not been
obtained solely as a result of a deliberate action or omission taken or omitted to be taken by the Company in material breach of its obligations under
Section 6.10(a) with Knowledge of the Company that such action or omission would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause such material breach of
its obligations under Section 6.10(a).

any information provided in writing by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives expressly for use in
connection with the Debt Financing).

respective representatives pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement;

Equity Financing and the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements.

by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing, if any) (the “Parent Expenses”); provided, that the existence of circumstances which could require the
Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(ii) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay
the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.03(b); provided, further, that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section
8.03(b) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(ii) except to the extent
indicated in Section 8.03(a).

shareholders, and (b) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the Company’s shareholders
unless required by Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party to be bound thereby. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

(c) Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies. Solely to the extent that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under
the terms of this Section 9.11, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be

this Agreement and without such rights, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity to the extent that the right of specific
performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this Section 9.11. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (to the extent that the right of

BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES INC_20220202_DEFM14A_19817567_4374090.Pdf,ANNEX B—OPINION OF DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES INC.,"Annex B
December 17, 2021
Board of Directors
Bottomline Technologies, Inc.
325 Corporate Drive
Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”) has acted as financial advisor to Bottomline Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) in connection with the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 16, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Project RB Parent, LLC (“Parent”),
and Project RB Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), which provides, among other things, for the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company, as a result of which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Transaction”). As set forth more
fully in the Merger Agreement, as a result of the Transaction, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of
the Company, other than dissenting shares and shares owned directly or indirectly by the Company or Parent, will be converted into the right to receive
$57.00 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”).
You have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.
In connection with our role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed certain publicly available financial and other
information concerning the Company, and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to the Company prepared by
management of the Company. We have also held discussions with certain senior officers and other representatives and advisors of the Company
regarding the businesses and prospects of the Company. In addition, we have (i) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company
Common Stock, (ii) compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies we
considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded, (iii) reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations which we deemed relevant, (iv) reviewed the Merger Agreement, and (v) performed such other studies and analyses and considered such
other factors as we deemed appropriate.
We have not assumed responsibility for independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any information, whether publicly available or
furnished to us, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the rendering of our
opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of our opinion, we have, with your knowledge and permission, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and
completeness of all such information. We have not conducted a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and have not prepared, obtained
or reviewed any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or
liabilities), of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company under any law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made available to us and used in our analyses (the “Forecasts”), we
have assumed with your knowledge and permission that such Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering our opinion, we express no view as to the
reasonableness of such Forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they are based. Our opinion is necessarily based upon economic, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation
to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting our opinion of which we become aware after the date hereof.
For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that, in all respects material to our analysis, the
Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
B-1Table of Contents
Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to our analysis. We also
have assumed with your knowledge and permission that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection
with the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other
approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with respect to such issues.
This opinion has been approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and is addressed to, and is for the
use and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion is
limited to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the date hereof. This
opinion does not address any other terms of the Transaction or the Merger Agreement. You have not asked us to, and this opinion does not, address the
fairness of the Transaction, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company, nor does it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We express no opinion as to the merits
of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative
transactions or business strategies. Nor do we express an opinion, and this opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the Transaction. In addition, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness,
financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company’s officers, directors, or
employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock.
Deutsche Bank will be paid a fee for its services as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which becomes
payable upon delivery of this opinion (or would have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render
this opinion) and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. The Company has also agreed to reimburse
Deutsche Bank for its expenses, and to indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain liabilities, in connection with its engagement. We are an affiliate of
Deutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates, the “DB Group”). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are
currently providing, commercial banking (including extension of credit) and other financial services to Parent or its affiliates for which they have received,
and in the future may receive, compensation, including (i) acting as joint arranger for Thoma Bravo LLC, an affiliate of Parent, on a debt financing
transaction in February 2019, (ii) acting as joint bookrunner for Thoma Bravo LLC and lender on a debt financing transaction in November 2020, (iii)
receiving deferred fees from Thoma Bravo LLC in June 2021 in connection with a SPAC initial public offering and (iv) acting as joint bookrunner for
Thoma Bravo LLC on debt financing transactions in October 2020 and January, March, April, May and September 2021. In addition, the DB Group may
also provide investment and commercial banking services to Parent and the Company in the future, for which we would expect the DB Group to receive
compensation. In the ordinary course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of
Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any
time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions, it is Deutsche Bank’s opinion as investment bankers
that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock.
Very truly yours,
DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES INC.

BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES INC_20220202_DEFM14A_19817567_4374090.Pdf,ANNEX C—SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,"Annex C
§ 262. Appraisal rights
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of
this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has
otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in
writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock
under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of
record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
“depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of
this title:
(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the
meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of
immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record
by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent
corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
provided in § 251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation
pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof;
b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;
c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this
section; or
d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.
(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned
by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4) [Repealed.]
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its
C-1Table of Contents
certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth
in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on
the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or
all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent
corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for
appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed
to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing
to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with
this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has
become effective; or
(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each
of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the
merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a
copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such
stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the
date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or
resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic
transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal
rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all
such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days
following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to
C-2
Table of Contents
appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary
or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive
either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice
is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by
electronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall
be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number
of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate
number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and
accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder’s request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a
person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares
have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition
shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed
for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at
the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper
of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by
mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.
(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and
if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the

proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent
corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all
holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such
total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the
fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all
relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a
corporation of this State or of any state.
(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against
the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection
(d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock
(except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if
such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e)
of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of
the Court, and such approval

may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal
and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth
in subsection (e) of this section.
(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
