The Merger Agreement generally restricts the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to (and requires the Company and its subsidiaries to
instruct and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives not to) directly or indirectly:
 
•
solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist,

of its subsidiaries or its affiliated practices, or to afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of Oak
Street Health, any of its subsidiaries or its affiliated practices, in connection with the making, submission or announcement of, or to
knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate, a proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an

obligations (other than a de minimis breach) and the Oak Street Health Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below in the section of this proxy

Health is entitled to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to, and afford access to
the business and personnel of, Oak Street Health or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal.
The Oak Street Health Board generally is not permitted under the Merger Agreement to make an Oak Street Health Board Recommendation
Change. However, prior to the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Oak Street
Health stockholders, the Oak Street Health Board is permitted to make an Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change in response to (i) an
Intervening Event (as defined below in the section titled “The Merger Agreement — No-Shop; Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change”)
or (ii) to accept an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of the Company’s no-shop obligations (other than a de minimis breach)
and the Oak Street Health Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, if, in either case, the Oak Street Health Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Any such Oak Street Health
Board Recommendation Change is subject to the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, including that Oak Street Health negotiates in good
faith with CVS Pharmacy, if so desired by CVS Pharmacy, for four business days (or two business days following an amended Acquisition Proposal)
to make amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related documents so that, as applicable, the Oak Street Health
Board’s fiduciary duties no longer require it to make an Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event or
the Acquisition Proposal.",18,19

If the Merger is consummated, shares of Oak Street Health common stock held by Oak Street Health stockholders who do not vote in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold such shares through the Effective Time and who properly demand appraisal of such
shares (and who do not withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights), and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the
DGCL will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but Oak Street Health stockholders will be entitled to receive such
consideration as will be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Oak Street Health stockholders will be entitled to have
their shares of Oak Street Health common stock appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Court of Chancery”)
and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock if the Merger is completed, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be
fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Oak Street Health stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Oak
Street Health common stock are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the
complexity of the appraisal process.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock as
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they would receive
pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock.
The right to seek appraisal will be lost if an Oak Street Health stockholder votes “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
However, abstaining or voting “AGAINST” adoption of the Merger Agreement is
 
x
iTable of Contents
not itself sufficient to perfect appraisal rights within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL because additional actions must also be taken to
perfect such rights. To exercise your appraisal rights, you must, among other things, (i) submit a written demand for appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL to Oak Street Health before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) not vote (in person or by proxy)
in favor of the Merger Proposal, and (iii) continue to hold your shares of Oak Street Health common stock through the Effective Time and (iv)
comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to comply strictly with the Delaware law
procedures for exercising statutory appraisal rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in the section of this proxy statement
titled “Appraisal Rights”, will result in the loss of appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost

The receipt of cash by an Oak Street Health stockholder who is a U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) in exchange for shares of Oak Street Health common stock pursuant to the
Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local
or foreign income or other tax laws. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you are a U.S. holder, you will recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive (or are deemed to receive) in the Merger and your adjusted tax basis in the shares of
Oak Street Health common stock converted into cash in the Merger. If you are an Oak Street Health stockholder who is a non-U.S. holder (as defined
below in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”), the Merger will generally
not be a taxable transaction to you under U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections to the United States, or Oak Street Health
is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. Further, the Merger may be a taxable transaction to you under non-
U.S. tax laws, and you are encouraged to seek tax advice regarding such matters. Because individual circumstances may differ, we urge you to
consult your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax effects to you.

The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the Special Meeting and the
Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as an Oak Street Health stockholder. You should read
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this
proxy statement.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
On February 7, 2023, Oak Street Health entered into the Merger Agreement with CVS Pharmacy, Merger Sub and, solely for the limited purposes set
forth therein, CVS Health. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Oak Street Health, with Oak Street Health
surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Pharmacy.
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Oak Street Health Board in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting as described in this proxy statement because you have been
identified as an Oak Street Health stockholder as of the close of business on the Record Date.
As an Oak Street Health stockholder, what will I receive in the Merger?
Each share of Oak Street Health common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Oak Street Health common stock (i) (A) held by Oak Street Health as treasury stock or (B) owned by CVS Pharmacy or any of its subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub), in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their statutory rights of
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or (iii) subject to outstanding RSAs) will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and converted
into the right to receive $39.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”).
The exchange of shares of Oak Street Health common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a more
detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of
how the Merger will affect you for federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes.
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the recent trading price of Oak Street Health common stock?
The Merger Consideration of $39.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 73% over Oak Street Health’s closing share price on January
9, 2023, the last full trading day prior to Bloomberg’s published article reporting that CVS Health was exploring an acquisition of Oak Street Health. On
March 28, 2023, the most recent practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement, the closing price of Oak Street Health common stock was $36.25
per share.
What will happen to outstanding Oak Street Health equity awards in the Merger?
Each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Oak Street Health common stock (an “Option”) with an exercise price per share less
than $39.00 that is vested or that, as a result of the Merger would become vested, as of the Effective Time (with any performance conditions applicable to
such Option determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), will, at the Effective Time,
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
 
1Table of Contents
interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock subject to such
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess of $39.00 over the per share exercise price of such Option. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding and unexercised Option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, whether vested or unvested,
will be automatically cancelled for no consideration.
Each Option that is unvested at the Effective Time and not cancelled pursuant to the provisions described in the preceding paragraph will, at the
Effective Time, automatically be cancelled and converted into the contractual right to receive a payment in cash (without interest and subject to
applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock subject to such Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess of $39.00 over the exercise price per share of such Option (each, a “Converted Option Cash Award”), and
each Converted Option Cash Award will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting provisions, but excluding exercise
provisions) as applied to the corresponding Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and will become payable in accordance with the original
vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding Option, except that each Converted Option Cash Award will provide that the unvested portion, if any,
of such Converted Option Cash Award will immediately vest and become payable upon a termination of the holder’s employment or services without
“cause” or a resignation by the holder for “good reason” that occurs within the 12-month period following the Effective Time.
Each RSA that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will, at the Effective Time, automatically be assumed by CVS Pharmacy
and converted into a corresponding CVS Health restricted stock award (each, an “Assumed RSA”) on the same terms and conditions (including
applicable vesting and expiration provisions) as applied to each such RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed RSA will
cover a number of whole shares of CVS Health common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock
underlying such RSA as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (as defined below), and such Assumed RSA
will provide that the unvested portion, if any, of such Assumed RSA will immediately vest and settle upon a termination of the holder’s employment or
services without “cause” or a resignation by the holder for “good reason” that occurs within the 12-month period following the Effective Time.
Each Oak Street Health restricted stock unit award (each, an “RSU”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is vested
or, as a result of the Merger, would become vested as of the Effective Time (in each case, with any performance conditions applicable to such RSU
determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), will, at the Effective Time, automatically be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of
(i) $39.00 and (ii) the number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock subject to such RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Cash-Out
RSU”).
Each RSU granted on or after February 7, 2023 that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time will, at the Effective Time, automatically be
assumed by CVS Pharmacy and converted into a corresponding CVS Health restricted stock unit award (each, an “Assumed RSU Award”) on the same
terms and conditions (including applicable vesting and expiration provisions) as applied to each such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that each Assumed RSU Award will cover a number of whole shares of CVS Health common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Oak
Street Health common stock underlying such RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.
Each RSU (other than Cash-Out RSUs and RSUs granted on or after February 7, 2023) that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time
will, at the Effective Time, automatically be cancelled and converted into the contractual right to receive a payment in an amount of cash (without interest
and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) $39.00 and (ii) the total number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock
subject to such RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Converted RSU Cash Award”), and each Converted RSU Cash Award will be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including
 
2
Table of Contents
time-based vesting) as applied to such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and will become payable in accordance with the original vesting
schedule applicable to the corresponding RSU, except that each Converted RSU Cash Award will provide that the unvested portion, if any, of such
Converted RSU Cash Award will immediately vest and become payable upon a termination of the holder’s employment or services without “cause” or a
resignation by the holder for “good reason” that occurs within the 12-month period following the Effective Time.
The “Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the volume weighted average
closing sale price (rounded to the nearest cent) of one share of CVS Health common stock as reported on the NYSE as reported on Bloomberg L.P. under
the function “VWAP” (or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by the parties) for the 10 consecutive trading days
ending on (and including) the date that is two trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time (as adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock
splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations, reclassifications or similar events), rounded to the nearest 0.0001.

What proposals will be considered at the Special Meeting?
At the Special Meeting, Oak Street Health stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 
•
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”);
 
•
a proposal to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or may become payable to the named
executive officers of Oak Street Health in connection with the Merger (the “Compensation Proposal”); and
 
•
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Pursuant to Oak Street Health’s Amended and Restated Bylaws, the only business that will be transacted at the Special Meeting are the Merger
Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, as stated in the accompanying notice of the Special Meeting.
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Special Meeting?
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health common stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will
determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting to
another date or time.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Oak Street Health common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting as of the close of business on the Record Date. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street
Health common stock deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s
 
4
Table of Contents
failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee), as well as abstentions, will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
The approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Oak Street
Health common stock present, in person or represented by proxy. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street Health common stock deemed not in attendance at
the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such
holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory and non-binding and is not a condition to the
completion of the Merger.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Oak Street Health
common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on such matter. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street Health common stock deemed
not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting
instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
What is a “broker non-vote”? 
If a beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee does not provide the
organization that holds the owner’s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner’s shares
of Oak Street Health common stock may generally vote on “discretionary” matters but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker
non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide
discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not
received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Oak Street Health does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that
are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or
other nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions from you.
Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal.
How does the Oak Street Health Board recommend that I vote?
The Oak Street Health Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Oak Street Health Board considered in determining to recommend that Oak Street Health stockholders adopt
the Merger Agreement, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Recommendation of the Oak Street Health Board and
Reasons for the Merger.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Oak Street Health Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that certain of Oak Street Health’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Oak Street Health stockholders generally. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Interests of Oak Street Health’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Why am I being asked to cast an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or may become payable to the named executive
officers of Oak Street Health in connection with the Merger?
The SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted rules that require Oak Street Health
to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that may be made to the named executive officers of Oak Street Health in
connection with the Merger.
What will happen if Oak Street Health stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the vote on the
Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Oak Street Health, the Oak Street Health Board, CVS Pharmacy or the surviving
corporation. Accordingly, because Oak Street Health is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Oak
Street Health stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless
of the outcome of this advisory, non-binding vote.
What happens if I sell my shares of Oak Street Health common stock before the Special Meeting?
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer your shares of Oak Street Health
common stock after the close of business on the Record Date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the Special
Meeting. However, the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares of Oak Street Health
common stock. In order to receive the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, you must hold your shares of Oak Street Health common
stock through the Effective Time.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock. The written document describing the
matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used by Oak Street stockholders of record to
designate a proxy to vote their shares of Oak Street Health common stock is called a “proxy card.”
If an Oak Street Health stockholder of record gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares of Oak
Street Health common stock in the way that you indicate. When voting over the Internet or by telephone or by the proxy card, you may specify whether
your shares of Oak Street Health common stock should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST” or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the proposals
presented at the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of Oak Street Health common stock should be voted on
one or more proposals to be brought before the Special Meeting, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger
Proposal, “FOR” the Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if I am an Oak Street Health stockholder of record?
If your shares of Oak Street Health common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In that case, this proxy statement and your proxy card
have been sent directly to you by Oak Street Health.

Table of Contents
If you are an Oak Street Health stockholder of record as of the close of business on the Record Date, you may vote by submitting your proxy over
the Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid reply envelope. You may also vote your
shares of Oak Street Health common stock electronically during the Special Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are encouraged
to submit your vote by proxy as early as possible to ensure that your shares of Oak Street Health common stock will be represented. For more detailed
instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Special Meeting—Voting
Procedures.”
If you are an Oak Street Health stockholder of record and you return a properly signed proxy card but do not direct how to vote your shares of
Oak Street Health common stock on one or more of the proposals to be brought before the Special Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote your
shares of Oak Street Health common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the
Adjournment Proposal.
How do I cast my vote if my shares of Oak Street Health common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee?
If your shares of Oak Street Health common stock are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or
other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the Oak Street Health stockholder of record.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in “street name,” you will receive a voting instruction form from
your broker, bank, or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares of Oak Street Health common stock should be voted. You must
follow the instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote such shares. Your bank, broker or other nominee will vote your shares of
Oak Street Health common stock only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly completing the voting instruction form sent to you by your
bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement. Without providing those instructions, your shares of Oak Street Health common stock will not
be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If my shares of Oak Street Health common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee, what will happen if I abstain from
voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or fail to give voting instructions to your
bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions, failures to vote and failures to give voting instructions to your bank, broker or
other nominee will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?
Yes. If you are an Oak Street Health stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time prior to the time it is voted by:
 
•
filing with our Chief Legal Officer and Secretary a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy you wish to revoke;
 
•
properly casting a new vote over the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the Internet or telephone voting facilities
described under “The Special Meeting —Voting Procedures”;
 
7
Table of Contents
•
duly completing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Chief Legal Officer and Secretary; or
 
•
attending the Special Meeting online and voting electronically during the Special Meeting (although attendance at the Special Meeting will
not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to our offices at Oak Street Health, Inc., 30 W. Monroe
Street, Suite 1200, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attention: Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting. If you want to
revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or an instrument revoking your proxy to Oak Street Health, you should ensure that you send your new
proxy card or instrument revoking your proxy in sufficient time for it to be received by Oak Street Health prior to the taking of the vote at the Special
Meeting.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in “street name,” you must contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions as to how to change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock electronically at
the Special Meeting.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
You may receive more than one set of proxy materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and/or multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction forms. For example, if you hold your shares of Oak Street Health common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares of Oak Street Health common stock. If you are an Oak Street Health
stockholder of record and your shares of Oak Street Health common stock are registered in more than one name, you may receive more than one proxy
card. Please submit your proxy and/or voting instructions for each set of materials that you receive to ensure that all your shares of Oak Street Health
common stock are voted at the Special Meeting.
If I hold my shares of Oak Street Health common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
No. Promptly after the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing shares of Oak Street Health common stock (if any) that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be sent a letter of transmittal describing the procedure for surrendering his, her, its or
their shares of Oak Street Health common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. If you hold your shares of Oak Street Health common stock in
certificated form, you will receive your cash payment after the payment agent receives your stock certificates and any other documents requested in the
instructions. You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the
payment agent without a letter of transmittal. If you hold shares of Oak Street Health common stock in uncertificated, book-entry form, you will not be
required to deliver a stock certificate, and you will receive your cash payment after the payment agent receives an “agent’s message” and any other
documents requested in the instructions.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
If available, we may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. We intend to publish final voting results in a
Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that Oak Street Health files with the SEC are publicly
available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?
If the Merger is completed, Oak Street Health stockholders who continuously hold shares of Oak Street Health common stock through the Effective
Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
 
8
Table of Contents
Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock and do not withdraw their demands, and who otherwise
comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock
in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Oak Street Health stockholders are entitled to have their shares of Oak
Street Health common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Oak Street
Health common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the
amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount
determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding).
Oak Street Health stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock as
determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the
Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock. Oak Street Health stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of
their shares of Oak Street Health common stock are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in
additional detail in this proxy statement, and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly
available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in a
timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the section of this proxy statement titled “Appraisal Rights.”
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
We are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and currently expect to complete the Merger in 2023. However, the exact
timing of completion of the Merger cannot be accurately predicted because the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, waiver) of the conditions to CVS Pharmacy, Merger Sub and Oak Street Health’s respective obligations to consummate the Merger, some
of which are not within the parties’ control.
What effect will the Merger have on Oak Street Health?
If the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Oak Street Health, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
thereupon cease, and Oak Street Health will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Pharmacy. Following completion
of the Merger, shares of Oak Street Health common stock will be delisted from the NYSE, and the registration of shares of Oak Street Health common
stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Oak Street Health stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of Oak Street Health common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Oak Street Health will remain an
independent public company and stockholders will continue to own their shares of Oak Street Health common stock. Oak Street Health common stock will
continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on the NYSE. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Oak
Street Health may be obligated to pay to CVS Health a termination fee. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, CVS Health may be
obligated to pay to Oak Street Health a termination fee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement
— Termination Fees and Expenses.”

What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to two or more stockholders that share the same last name and household
mailing address, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if a company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such
cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction form. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health
common stock held in “street name,” you will receive your proxy materials and voting instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee and you will
provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock at the Special Meeting. You
should vote on and sign each proxy card you receive as discussed above.

stockholder for any purpose germane to the Special Meeting beginning 10 days prior to the Special Meeting and ending on the date of the Special

Quorum",38,38
"Oak Street Health, Inc._20230330_DEFM14A_20760527_4632592.Pdf",Quorum,"Quorum
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health common stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting, or 122,128,512 shares of Oak Street Health common stock, is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the
Special Meeting. If a quorum fails to attend the Special Meeting, the chairman of the Special Meeting or the holders of a majority of the voting power of
the shares of Oak Street Health common stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the Special Meeting to another time
and/or place. The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat
abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
If a beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee does not provide the
organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds its shares may generally vote
on “discretionary” matters but cannot vote on “non-discretionary” matters. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other
nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a
particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the
beneficial owner of relevant shares. Oak Street Health does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks,
brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the
proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Oak Street
Health common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions from you. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to
vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the Special
Meeting to another date or time.",38,38
"Oak Street Health, Inc._20230330_DEFM14A_20760527_4632592.Pdf",Vote Required,"Vote Required
Adoption of the Merger Proposal
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of Oak Street Health stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares
of Oak Street Health common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the Record Date. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the
Special Meeting (whether due
 
16Table of Contents
to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee),
as well as abstentions, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Under the Merger Agreement, stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis, requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of shares of Oak Street Health common stock present, in person or represented by proxy. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the
Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s
bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the vote on the
Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Oak Street Health, the Oak Street Health Board, CVS Pharmacy or the surviving
corporation. Accordingly, because Oak Street Health is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Oak
Street Health stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless
of the outcome of the advisory, non-binding vote.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Oak Street Health common stock present, in
person or represented by proxy. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or
a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of
the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Oak Street Health does not
intend to call a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.

As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, at the Special Meeting, Oak Street Health stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement (referred to as “the Merger Proposal”). The Merger cannot be completed without the adoption of the Merger Agreement by
the requisite vote of Oak Street Health stockholders. You are urged to carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed information
concerning the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the information set forth under the sections of this proxy statement titled “The Merger” and
“The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement
carefully and in its entirety.
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of Oak Street Health stockholders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Oak
Street Health common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street Health common stock deemed not in
attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions
to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the Merger Proposal), as well as abstentions, will have the same effect as a vote

Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Oak Street Health is required to submit a proposal to
its stockholders to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the “golden parachute” compensation payments that will or may be made by Oak Street
Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This proposal, commonly known as a “say on golden parachute” proposal, gives
Oak Street Health stockholders the opportunity to vote on an advisory, non-binding basis on the “golden parachute” compensation payments that will or
may be paid by Oak Street Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger (referred to as the “Compensation Proposal”).
The “golden parachute” compensation that the named executive officers of Oak Street Health may be entitled to receive from Oak Street Health in
connection with the Merger is summarized in the table that appears in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Interests of Oak Street
Health’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Quantification of Payments and Benefits.” Such summary, in table form, includes the
compensation and benefits that may or will be paid by Oak Street Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
The Oak Street Health Board encourages you to carefully review the “golden parachute” compensation information disclosed in this proxy
statement.
The Oak Street Health Board unanimously recommends that Oak Street Health stockholders approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Oak Street
Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Quantification of
Payments and Benefits table and the related narrative disclosures.”
The approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock present, in
person or represented by proxy. Abstentions will not count as votes cast on the Compensation Proposal. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street Health
common stock deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to
provide any voting instructions to such holder’s bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the Compensation Advisory Proposal) will have no effect
on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Since the vote on the Compensation
Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either CVS Pharmacy or Oak Street Health. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the
Merger is consummated, the compensation payments that are contractually required to be paid by Oak Street Health to its named executive officers will or
may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote of Oak Street Health
stockholders.
The Oak Street Health Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the advisory, non-binding Compensation Proposal.

Oak Street Health is asking stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Oak Street Health Board to vote in favor of any

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. The following chronology
does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Oak Street Health Board, the Transaction Committee or the representatives of Oak Street
Health, CVS Health or their respective advisors and other parties.
The Oak Street Health Board, together with Oak Street Health senior management, and with the assistance of its outside legal and financial
advisors, regularly reviews and assesses Oak Street Health’s financial performance and long-term strategic plans and objectives in light of developments
in Oak Street Health’s business, the industries in which it operates, and economic, market and industry conditions generally. These reviews and
assessments have included, among other things, engagement in strategic discussions with participants in the healthcare industry and other market
participants, consideration of various potential strategic opportunities, including continuing as a standalone company with organic growth initiatives,
acquisitions of other companies or businesses in, or adjacent to, the industries in which Oak Street Health operates and other potential strategic
alternatives, in each case, with a view towards enhancing stockholder value and delivering the highest quality care to patients.
In connection with reviewing and assessing these possible strategic discussions and other opportunities, Oak Street Health has periodically
sought the advice of Centerview, based on Centerview’s qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of Oak Street Health’s business and
affairs and the industries in which it operates.
In late October 2021, at the suggestion of Centerview, an introduction of Mr. Mike Pykosz, Chief Executive Officer of Oak Street Health, and Mr. Tim
Cook, Chief Financial Officer of Oak Street Health, to Mr. Shawn Guertin, Chief Financial Officer of CVS Health, was facilitated by Centerview. This
introduction led to an in-person meeting on December 10, 2021, held at the headquarters of CVS Health in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, among Messrs.
Pykosz, Cook, and Guertin. At this meeting, Mr. Pykosz and Mr. Cook provided a general overview of Oak Street Health’s business, the market in which it
operates and potential growth opportunities for the business. Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, and Guertin also discussed, at a high level, the potential benefits of
a strategic partnership between the two companies and agreed to stay in touch. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with
respect to any partnership or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the meeting.
 
25Table of Contents
On January 28, 2022, Mr. Guertin contacted Messrs. Pykosz and Cook to discuss Oak Street Health’s performance in light of the presentation given
by Oak Street Health at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 10, 2022. Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, and Guertin agreed to schedule an operational
discussion among representatives of both companies to continue to explore whether a potential commercial partnership or other strategic transaction
would be beneficial to both companies and their respective stockholders. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect
to any partnership or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the discussion.
On March 21, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook attended an introductory meeting by videoconference with Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President,
Capital Markets of CVS Health. At such meeting, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook agreed to provide CVS Health with the materials prepared for Oak Street
Health’s investor day hosted on March 16, 2022. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any partnership or
other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the meeting.
On September 21, 2022, a meeting was held by videoconference among Mr. Cook, Geoffrey Price, Chief Innovation Officer of Oak Street Health, and
certain representatives of CVS Health, during which representatives of CVS Health asked a number of questions relating to, among other things, Oak
Street Health’s operating model, provider structure, growth strategy, technology capabilities (including with respect to its proprietary Canopy platform),
and payor relationships. During this meeting, representatives of CVS Health expressed a potential interest in acquiring Oak Street Health. However, no
proposal was made by CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any acquisition or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street
Health during the meeting. The representatives of Oak Street Health and CVS Health agreed to discuss Oak Street Health’s business further at a later date,
including with CVS Health’s financial advisors.
On September 26, 2022, in response to increased merger and acquisition activity in the value-based primary care market, Oak Street Health’s senior
management contacted representatives of Centerview to ask them to prepare a presentation to be delivered at the Oak Street Health Board’s regularly
scheduled monthly business review session to take place on September 28, 2022.
On September 28, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a regularly scheduled monthly business review session, during which representatives of
Centerview presented an overview of current market conditions, including with respect to mergers and acquisitions activity, with a focus on primary care
assets. During this meeting, the Oak Street Health Board discussed the healthcare industry broadly and the increased interest by strategic acquirors in
acquiring primary care assets. During the review session, after representatives of Centerview had left the meeting, it was noted to the Oak Street Health
Board that Messrs. Cook and Price had taken part in a meeting with representatives of CVS Health the week prior, in which representatives of CVS Health
had expressed a potential interest in acquiring Oak Street Health, but that no proposal was made by either company.
On October 6, 2022, representatives of CVS Health contacted representatives of Centerview to schedule a discussion on October 7, 2022, to take
place in advance of a discussion scheduled for the following week among representatives of Oak Street Health, CVS Health and their respective financial
advisors.
On October 7, 2022, Bloomberg published an article reporting that CVS Health was in exclusive talks to acquire a different primary care provider.
The scheduled call among representatives of Oak Street Health, CVS Health and their respective financial advisors was subsequently cancelled.
Representatives of Centerview contacted Mr. Cowhey to confirm whether this news impacted any discussions with Oak Street Health. Mr. Cowhey
indicated to representatives of Centerview that he would reach out directly to representatives of Oak Street Health to discuss this issue.
On October 10, 2022, Mr. Cowhey called Mr. Cook to inform him that CVS Health continued to be interested in a potential acquisition of Oak Street
Health and that it would be mutually beneficial for both
 
26

companies to further explore the opportunity. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any partnership or other
strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the call. Additionally, Mr. Cowhey indicated that Karen Lynch, President and
Chief Executive Officer of CVS Health, would contact Mr. Pykosz to discuss CVS Health’s interest in a strategic transaction with Oak Street Health.
On October 14, 2022, Ms. Lynch called Mr. Pykosz to reiterate CVS Health’s interest in pursuing further discussions with Oak Street Health
regarding a potential transaction. During this discussion, Ms. Lynch and Mr. Pykosz discussed, among other things, the potential strategic benefits of a
combination of both companies. Mr. Pykosz indicated to Ms. Lynch that while the Oak Street Health Board was not actively contemplating a sale of the
company, the Oak Street Health Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that create value for Oak Street Health’s stockholders. Mr. Pykosz and
Ms. Lynch tentatively scheduled a site tour of an Oak Street Health primary care center located in Rhode Island for October 18, 2022. No proposal was
made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any partnership or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health
during the call.
On October 18, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook provided Ms. Lynch, Mr. Cowhey and Dr. Amar Desai, President, Health Care Delivery of CVS
Health, with a tour of an Oak Street Health primary care center located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, during which Messrs. Pykosz and Cook responded
to questions from the representatives of CVS Health regarding Oak Street Health’s business and potential growth opportunities. In addition, the
representatives of Oak Street Health and CVS Health discussed potential strategic opportunities resulting from a combination of the businesses, but no
specific terms were discussed.
On October 28, 2022, Mr. Cowhey called Mr. Cook to inform him that CVS Health and its advisors were continuing to evaluate the financial impact
of a potential combination of the two companies, and indicated that CVS Health intended to submit a preliminary indication of interest to acquire Oak
Street Health between November 4, 2022 and November 7, 2022, but did not propose any specific terms.
On November 1, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s
senior management, during which, among other things, Oak Street Health’s senior management provided an update on Oak Street Health’s financial and
operational performance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz also informed the Oak Street Health Board of the inbound interest from CVS Health, the status
of the preliminary conversations among Messrs. Pykosz and Cook and members of CVS Health’s senior management, and the forthcoming indication of
interest from CVS Health expected over the course of the following week. During this meeting, the Oak Street Health Board also resolved to form a special
ad-hoc transaction committee (the “Transaction Committee”) for purposes of efficiency only, and not to address any actual or potential conflicts of
interest. Mr. Pykosz, Robbert Vorhoff, Paul Kusserow and Kim Keck, each of whom had significant experience with mergers and acquisitions transactions,
were appointed to the Transaction Committee. The Oak Street Health Board authorized the Transaction Committee to provide management and advisors
with evaluation and oversight from the Transaction Committee (on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board) should an indication of interest from CVS
Health be received and to provide timely input from the Transaction Committee (on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board) on any issues relating to any
potential transaction on an ongoing basis; provided that any potential transaction involving Oak Street Health would need to be approved by the full
Oak Street Health Board. Throughout the Transaction Committee’s evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, the Transaction Committee conducted
several formal meetings, but its members were also in regular contact with Oak Street Health’s senior management and legal and financial advisors and
with one another. Additionally, the Oak Street Health Board discussed Centerview’s existing relationship and familiarity with Oak Street Health, reputation
as a highly regarded investment bank and advisory firm, substantial knowledge of the industry in which Oak Street Health operates and extensive
experience in providing financial advice in connection with strategic transactions. The Oak Street Health Board authorized Oak Street Health’s senior
management to formally engage Centerview as a financial advisor to advise on any transaction with potential strategic acquirors.

On November 2, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook called representatives of Centerview to update them on the discussions with CVS Health since
October 7, 2022, and to seek to engage Centerview to advise Oak Street Health in advance of receiving an indication of interest from CVS Health in the
coming days and to evaluate other strategic alternatives.
On November 7, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Messrs. Guertin and
Cowhey conveyed to Messrs. Pykosz and Cook, on behalf of CVS Health, a verbal, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Oak Street Health at a price of $28.00 per share (the “Initial Proposal”). Mr. Pykosz indicated that he would communicate this Initial
Proposal to the Oak Street Health Board, but shared his view with Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey that he believed that the Initial Proposal significantly
undervalued Oak Street Health’s business and expected that it was unlikely that the Oak Street Health Board would engage in discussions about a
potential transaction at this price. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey suggested that Oak Street Health consider entering into a confidentiality agreement with
CVS Health to allow CVS Health to conduct additional due diligence and potentially increase its proposal.
On November 8, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with Mr. Cook and Robert Guenthner, Chief Legal Officer of
Oak Street Health, also in attendance, to discuss the terms of the Initial Proposal. After discussing the Initial Proposal, the Transaction Committee
determined that the Initial Proposal undervalued Oak Street Health’s business and it was not in the best interests of Oak Street Health’s stockholders for
the Oak Street Health Board to engage with CVS Health on a potential transaction at this price, and instructed senior management to inform CVS Health
accordingly.
On November 9, 2022, Mr. Cook called Mr. Cowhey to convey the message from the Transaction Committee. Mr. Cowhey reiterated that CVS Health
could potentially be in a position to make a proposal at a higher price with the benefit of additional information made available pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement.
On November 14, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Messrs. Guertin and
Cowhey conveyed to Messrs. Pykosz and Cook, on behalf of CVS Health, a revised verbal, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of the issued
and outstanding shares of Oak Street Health for a price ranging from $34.00 to $36.00 per share (the “Second Proposal”). Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey
further indicated that they were optimistic that, after signing a confidentiality agreement and conducting additional due diligence on non-public
information, CVS Health hoped to be able to increase its proposal to reflect a “high $30’s per share” valuation. Mr. Pykosz indicated that he would
communicate the Second Proposal to the Oak Street Health Board, but shared his view that the Second Proposal continued to undervalue Oak Street
Health’s business and also expected that it was unlikely that the Oak Street Health Board would engage in discussions about a potential transaction at
this price.
On November 15, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with Messrs. Cook and Guenthner also in attendance, to
discuss the terms of the Second Proposal and CVS Health’s expressed belief that with additional due diligence on non-public information, it hoped to be
able to increase its proposal to reflect a “high $30s per share” valuation of Oak Street Health. The Transaction Committee discussed the underlying
rationale for the Second Proposal and potential responses to the Second Proposal. The Transaction Committee directed Oak Street Health senior
management to arrange a call with Centerview to discuss potential responses to the Second Proposal.
On November 17, 2022, the Transaction Committee held another meeting by videoconference, with Messrs. Cook and Guenthner and
representatives of Centerview also in attendance, to continue its discussion with respect to the terms of the Second Proposal. Representatives of
Centerview discussed with the Transaction Committee potential responses to the Second Proposal and recommended that Oak Street consider
simultaneously reaching out to other strategic parties who may have the resources and interest in considering a transaction with Oak Street Health. After
consultation with representatives of Centerview, the Transaction Committee instructed Oak Street
 
28
Table of Contents
Health’s senior management to inform CVS Health that the proposed valuation of Oak Street Health in the Second Proposal was insufficient, but that Oak
Street Health would be willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with CVS Health to share certain financial due diligence information and hold
meetings with CVS Health to further discuss Oak Street Health’s business and any potential synergies resulting from a combination, in order to enable
CVS Health to increase its proposal. The Transaction Committee also determined that it was in the best interests of Oak Street Health and its stockholders
to simultaneously initiate a limited exploratory process to evaluate whether other strategic parties might also have an interest in a potential strategic
transaction involving Oak Street Health. The Transaction Committee agreed with Centerview’s recommendation that Centerview, on behalf of Oak Street
Health, conduct a targeted and confidential outreach to a select group of other potential strategic acquirors identified as the parties most likely to be
interested in exploring a transaction with Oak Street Health based on their perceived and/or expressed interest in the primary care provider space and their
financial capability to consummate a transaction involving Oak Street Health, with the proposed outreach to be further discussed at the upcoming
meeting of the Oak Street Health Board.
On November 18, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Mr. Pykosz conveyed
the message from the Transaction Committee to Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey. Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey agreed to schedule a meeting
during the week of November 28, 2022, in advance of which a confidentiality agreement would be executed, to further discuss Oak Street Health’s
business and any potential synergies resulting from a combination, in order to enable CVS Health to increase its proposal.
On November 19, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board with an update
on the discussions with CVS Health, including the terms of the Second Proposal and CVS Health’s expressed belief that with additional due diligence, it
hoped to be able to increase its proposal to reflect a “high $30s per share” valuation of Oak Street Health. Representatives of Centerview reviewed with
the Oak Street Health Board its recommended approach, previously discussed with the Transaction Committee, to conduct a targeted and confidential
outreach, on behalf of Oak Street Health, to a select group of potential strategic acquirers, identified as the parties most likely to be interested in exploring
a transaction with Oak Street Health based on their perceived and/or expressed interest in the primary care provider space and their financial capability to
consummate a transaction involving Oak Street Health. The outreach would allow the Oak Street Health Board to gauge potential interest in a transaction
with Oak Street Health and preliminary views of potential valuation while, at the same time, continuing discussions with CVS Health. The Oak Street
Health Board approved Centerview’s outreach proposal and instructed Centerview to commence such outreach.
On November 20, 2022, at the direction of the Oak Street Health Board, representatives of Centerview contacted representatives of four potential
strategic acquirors (referred to herein as “Party A”, “Party B”, “Party C” and “Party D”) by email to offer them the opportunity to enter into a
confidentiality agreement and receive certain due diligence information if they were interested in a potential transaction with Oak Street Health.
Over the course of November 21, 2022 and November 22, 2022, representatives of Party A, Party B and Party C indicated that they were interested
in a potential transaction involving Oak Street Health and requested a copy of the draft confidentiality agreement.
Beginning on November 21, 2022, Oak Street Health’s senior management team prepared preliminary financial projections for the remainder of fiscal
year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2028 for use in connection with a potential strategic process. The Oak Street Health Board reviewed and provided
preliminary comments on such projections during the week of November 21, 2022.
On November 25, 2022, Oak Street Health entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A. The confidentiality agreement included customary
nondisclosure and nonuse provisions. The confidentiality agreement did not contain a standstill provision.

Health Board (the “Projections”, as discussed further in the section titled “Certain Financial Projections” of this proxy statement) for use in the
potential transaction process, including for Centerview’s financial analyses and for distribution to CVS Health and the strategic acquirors that had
expressed interest in exploring a potential transaction upon execution of a confidentiality agreement. Thereafter, the Projections were provided to the
parties participating in a potential transaction process who had entered into confidentiality agreements with Oak Street Health as part of their due
diligence (including to CVS Health on November 27, 2022) and to Centerview for use in their financial analyses.
On November 28, 2022, Oak Street Health entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party B. The confidentiality agreement included customary
nondisclosure and nonuse provisions. The confidentiality agreement did not contain a standstill provision.
Also on November 28, 2022, Oak Street Health’s senior management gave a presentation to representatives of CVS Health regarding Oak Street
Health’s business and performance, with representatives of Centerview and CVS Health’s financial advisors in attendance.
Also on November 28, 2022, representatives of Party D informed Centerview that Party D did not have the bandwidth to explore a potential
transaction with Oak Street Health at this time given other competing priorities.

and Cowhey conveyed to Messrs. Pykosz and Cook, on behalf of CVS Health, a further revised verbal, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of
the issued and outstanding shares of Oak Street Health for a price of $38.00 per share (the “Third Proposal”). Mr. Pykosz indicated that he
 
30
Table of Contents
would communicate the Third Proposal to the Oak Street Health Board, but noted that he expected that the valuation of Oak Street Health contemplated
by the Third Proposal was still likely lower than a value that the Oak Street Health Board would consider acceptable.
Also on December 7, 2022, Centerview submitted a relationship disclosure letter to the Oak Street Health Board, and the Oak Street Health Board
determined on this basis that there were no conflicts of interest that would affect the ability of Centerview to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor
to Oak Street Health.
Also on December 7, 2022, discussions with representatives of Party A regarding a potential transaction involving Oak Street Health terminated
due to Party A’s other competing priorities.
On December 9, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior management and
representatives of Centerview and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), outside counsel to Oak Street Health, in attendance. Representatives of Centerview
and Oak Street Health’s senior management updated the Transaction Committee on CVS Health’s Third Proposal and on the status of engagement with
Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D regarding a potential transaction (including that Party B was expected to provide an indication of valuation early
during the week of December 12, 2022). The Transaction Committee, together with the other attendees, discussed the terms of the Third Proposal and
various potential approaches regarding CVS Health and the other potential strategic acquirors, including timing considerations. Representatives of
Centerview reviewed the terms of the Third Proposal with the Oak Street Health Board in the context of their preliminary financial analyses based on,
among other things, publicly available Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates regarding Oak Street Health and the Projections, as well as
proposed alternatives to respond to the Third Proposal. The Transaction Committee determined to recommend to the Oak Street Health Board that Oak
Street Health’s senior management communicate a $43.00 per share counterproposal to CVS Health. The Transaction Committee, consistent with the
recommendation of Centerview, requested Centerview to call Party B ahead of receiving its proposal and provide more specific guidance on expected
valuation in light of CVS Health’s Third Proposal.
On December 11, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board
with an update on the status of ongoing discussions with CVS Health regarding a potential transaction, including receipt of the Third Proposal, and the
status of Centerview’s outreach to Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D. Representatives of Kirkland reviewed with the Oak Street Health Board its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law in these circumstances and discussed certain considerations for the Oak Street Health Board when evaluating a
potential sale of Oak Street Health. Representatives of Centerview discussed the terms of the Third Proposal in the context of their preliminary financial
analyses based on, among other things, publicly available Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates regarding Oak Street Health and the
Projections. Oak Street Health’s senior management led a discussion on opportunities available to Oak Street Health for future growth and risks of
continuing as a standalone business, given current market conditions and the competitive landscape for Oak Street Health. Representatives of
Centerview then presented the proposed approach with respect to CVS Health and Party B as endorsed by the Transaction Committee on December 9,
2022. The Oak Street Health Board discussed these items in significant detail, as well as a number of potential scenarios and timelines for a potential
transaction. Following such discussion, the Oak Street Health Board determined to deliver to CVS Health a counterproposal of $43.00 per share in
response to the Third Proposal and instructed Oak Street Health’s senior management to convey the same on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board.
On December 13, 2022, representatives of Centerview delivered to the Oak Street Health Board an updated relationship disclosure letter, and Oak
Street Health’s senior management determined on this basis that there were no conflicts of interest that would affect the ability of Centerview to fulfill its
responsibilities as financial advisor to Oak Street Health. Also on December 13, 2022, Oak Street Health and Centerview executed an engagement letter.

Table of Contents
On December 13, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Mr. Pykosz conveyed
to Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey that the Oak Street Health Board was unwilling to transact at $38.00 per share, but would be willing to proceed to the next
step of evaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at $43.00 per share. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey agreed to review this counterproposal with
CVS Health senior management and the CVS Health Board.
On December 16, 2022, Mr. Cowhey called Mr. Cook to provide an update on CVS Health’s ongoing diligence work and indicated to Mr. Cook that
internal discussions regarding Oak Street Health’s counterproposal were ongoing.
On December 19, 2022, during a videoconference meeting attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey
conveyed to Messrs. Pykosz and Cook, on behalf of CVS Health, a further revised verbal, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of the issued
and outstanding shares of Oak Street Health for $40.00 per share (the “Fourth Proposal”). Mr. Pykosz indicated that he would communicate the Fourth
Proposal to the Oak Street Health Board.
Also on December 19, 2022, Party B indicated to representatives of Centerview that it would consider a transaction to acquire Oak Street Health in a
range of $31.00 to $32.00 per share, but that it did not see a pathway to increasing its valuation beyond the “mid $30s” per share range.
Later on December 19, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board
with a detailed update on the ongoing discussions with CVS Health, including receipt of the Fourth Proposal. Representatives of Centerview provided
the Oak Street Health Board with an update on discussions with Party B and shared Party B’s indication that it had limited potential for improving its offer
beyond the “mid $30s” per share range. Oak Street Health’s senior management noted that while there was a possibility that through additional diligence,
Party B could eventually be in a position to offer beyond the “mid $30s” per share range, it was not clear whether Party B would be in a position to offer a
value comparable to the Fourth Proposal, and even if Party B were to offer a value comparable to the Fourth Proposal, Party B was considerably less
advanced than CVS Health in its diligence, was advocating for a less attractive transaction structure for Oak Street Health’s business and a transaction
with Party B potentially presented more regulatory risk than with CVS Health. In light of these considerations, the Oak Street Health Board instructed
Centerview to convey to Party B that its preliminary proposal was not at a level that properly reflected Oak Street Health’s value and report back to the
Oak Street Health Board for discussion of any response from Party B to this information. Representatives of Centerview then discussed their
perspectives on the Fourth Proposal in the context of their previously discussed preliminary financial analyses and discussed potential responses to the
Fourth Proposal in light of the fact that at such time no other party had expressed interest in a transaction with Oak Street Health at a comparable value.
Representatives of Kirkland provided an overview of the relevant regulatory considerations for the transaction. The Oak Street Health Board aligned on
conveying to CVS Health that the Oak Street Health Board would be prepared to move forward to the next step of evaluating and negotiating a potential
transaction at $41.00 per share, provided that the transaction includes strong commitments from CVS Health on regulatory matters. The Oak Street Health
Board instructed Oak Street Health’s senior management to convey this response to CVS Health on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board. Oak Street
Health’s senior management then reviewed with the Oak Street Health Board the final terms of the engagement letter entered into with Centerview on
December 13, 2022. The Oak Street Health Board agreed with the determination by Oak Street Health’s senior management, on the basis of the updated
relationship disclosure letter provided by Centerview on December 13, 2022, that there were no conflicts of interest that would affect the ability of
Centerview to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to Oak Street Health. Following discussion, the Oak Street Health Board expressed its
agreement with the terms of the engagement letter.
On December 20, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Mr. Pykosz conveyed
to Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey that the Oak Street Health Board
 
32
Table of Contents
would be prepared to move forward to the next step of evaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at $41.00 per share, provided that the
transaction included strong commitments from CVS Health on regulatory matters. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey indicated that they would communicate
this response to the CVS Health Board.
Later on December 20, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey reconvened and Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey communicated that the CVS
Health Board was also prepared to move forward expeditiously to the next step of evaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at $41.00 per share
contingent upon Oak Street Health entering into exclusivity with CVS Health for 45 days in order to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive
transaction documents with respect to a potential acquisition. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey indicated that the CVS Health Board would not agree to
transact at any price above $41.00 per share. Mr. Pykosz noted that he would discuss the proposed exclusivity period with the Oak Street Health Board.
Later on December 20, 2022, representatives of Centerview contacted Party B to indicate that the Oak Street Health Board was not willing to
proceed with a transaction at the valuation proposed by Party B.
Later on December 20, 2022, Mr. Cowhey sent Mr. Cook a draft exclusivity agreement.
On December 21, 2022, representatives of Party C contacted representatives of Centerview to inform them that Party C would not be submitting a
proposal to acquire Oak Street Health, noting that an acquisition of Oak Street Health was inconsistent with its strategic priorities.
Also on December 21, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a regularly scheduled monthly business review session by videoconference, with
members of Oak Street Health’s senior management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Cook
provided the Oak Street Health Board with a business update on the financial performance of Oak Street Health. Mr. Pykosz then provided the Oak Street
Health Board with a detailed update on the ongoing discussions with CVS Health, including CVS Health’s willingness to proceed to the next step of
evaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at a price of $41.00 per share contingent upon Oak Street Health entering into an exclusivity agreement
with CVS Health for a period of 45 days for purposes of negotiating such a transaction. Representatives of Centerview also provided an update on
discussions with Party B, and the status of outreach to Party A and Party C. The Oak Street Health Board discussed the benefits and drawbacks of
exclusivity (including, in light of the fact that there was currently no other interested party willing to propose a transaction at a comparable value
(including following Centerview’s outreach)). Following discussion, the Oak Street Health Board approved entering into an exclusivity agreement with
CVS Health for an initial 30-day exclusivity period, with an automatic extension in certain circumstances.
On December 22, 2022, Oak Street Health and CVS Health executed the exclusivity agreement reflecting the exclusivity period approved by the Oak
Street Health Board during the December 21, 2022 meeting.
Also on December 22, 2022, CVS Health was provided with access to a virtual data room with additional diligence information regarding Oak Street
Health.
On December 23, 2022, Kirkland provided the Oak Street Health Board a summary of the key terms of the initial draft of the Merger Agreement
proposed to be sent to CVS Health. The initial draft of the Merger Agreement contemplated, among other things, a regulatory efforts covenant that
required CVS Health to take all actions necessary to obtain all regulatory clearances (including divestitures and other remedies) up to the level of a
material adverse effect on the combined company (measured as if the combined company was the size of Oak Street Health), restrictions on CVS Health’s
ability to enter into transactions which would prevent, delay or impede obtaining regulatory clearance for the transaction, and entry into customary
voting agreements with the Specified Stockholders, which collectively held approximately 45% of Oak Street Health’s shares of common stock at such
time.

On December 26, 2022, Oak Street Health and CVS Health executed a separate “clean team” agreement, pursuant to which it was agreed that certain
competitively sensitive information of Oak Street Health and CVS Health would only be shared with a specified subset of the representatives of Oak
Street Health and CVS Health.
Also on December 26, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Shearman & Sterling LLP
(“Shearman”), outside counsel to CVS Health. Between December 23, 2022 and January 20, 2023, and again between February 3, 2023 and February 7,
2023, representatives of Kirkland, Shearman, Dechert LLP (“Dechert”), outside antitrust counsel to CVS Health, and McDermott Will & Emery LLP
(“McDermott”), outside healthcare regulatory counsel to CVS Health, and members of Oak Street Health’s and CVS Health’s respective senior
management teams engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement. Among other items in the draft Merger
Agreement, representatives of Oak Street Health, CVS Health and their respective legal counsel negotiated (i) the efforts required by the parties to obtain
regulatory clearance, including restrictions on CVS Health entering into transactions in the same line of business as Oak Street Health that could
reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially increase the risk of not obtaining the required regulatory clearance for the transaction, (ii) the
quantum of the reverse termination fee payable by CVS Health to Oak Street Health if regulatory clearance for the transaction is not obtained and the
circumstances in which such fee would be payable, (iii) the non-solicitation provision that prohibits Oak Street Health from soliciting and negotiating with
third parties to enter into an agreement for an alternative business combination transaction and the related termination rights and termination fee payable
by Oak Street Health, (iv) the treatment of outstanding Oak Street Health equity awards and covenants regarding employee benefit matters applicable to
Company employees, and (iv) Oak Street Health’s representations, warranties and interim operating covenants.
On December 31, 2022, representatives of Shearman sent an initial draft of the form of Voting Agreement to representatives of Kirkland. This draft
was shared by Kirkland with respective outside counsel to General Atlantic and Newlight. Between December 31, 2022 and January 20, 2023, and again
between February 3, 2023 and February 7, 2023, representatives of Kirkland and Shearman engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the
form of Voting Agreement.
On January 4, 2023, representatives of Shearman sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Kirkland.
On January 6, 2023, a member of the Oak Street Health Board met with Dr. Desai for general business purposes unrelated to a potential transaction
involving Oak Street Health and CVS Health. During this meeting, Dr. Desai expressed his excitement about a potential combination of the two companies
and the member of Oak Street Health Board shared such member’s views on the strength of Oak Street Health’s business and the management team.
On January 7, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board
with a detailed update on the status of the potential transaction with CVS Health, including CVS Health’s desire to be in a position to announce a
definitive transaction before the opening of the U.S. stock markets on January 23, 2023. The Oak Street Health Board then discussed a request from CVS
Health to discuss post-closing continuity of leadership with Oak Street Health’s senior management. Oak Street Health’s senior management agreed that
it would not have any such discussions with CVS Health until the Oak Street Health Board provided its approval. In an executive session (which Mr.
Pykosz did not attend), the directors determined that the retention discussions with Oak Street Health senior management requested by CVS Health
should only occur following confirmation from CVS Health that it was prepared to proceed at a specific value and alignment with CVS Health on timing to
signing a definitive agreement.
On January 9, 2023, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook gave a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, during which they shared positive
updates to the Company’s fiscal year 2022 results and guidance

for fiscal year 2023. That same day, after close of U.S. stock markets, Bloomberg published an article reporting that CVS Health was exploring an
acquisition of Oak Street Health in a deal that would value Oak Street Health at more than $10 billion, including debt. Oak Street Health’s stock opened at
$29.77 per share on the morning of January 10, 2023, as compared to its closing price of $22.57 on January 9, 2023.
On January 11, 2023, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft of the Oak Street Health disclosure letter to representatives of Shearman.
Between January 11, 2023 and February 7, 2023, representatives of Kirkland, Shearman, Dechert and McDermott and members of Oak Street Health’s and
CVS Health’s respective management teams engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the Oak Street Health disclosure letter and other
transaction documents.
On January 17, 2023, Ms. Lynch contacted Mr. Pykosz and informed him that the CVS Health Board was no longer willing to proceed at $41.00 per
share and was reducing its proposed value to $38.00 per share, and indicated that such reduction was due to the concentration level of payor-affiliated
centers, but that CVS Health otherwise remained committed to pursuing a transaction with Oak Street Health. Mr. Pykosz responded that he would
convey the reduced price and articulated rationale for the reduction to the Oak Street Health Board.
Later on January 17, 2023, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook discussed with Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey CVS Health’s rationale for the proposed price
reduction, including CVS Health’s methodology for calculating the price reduction. During the meeting, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook expressed their views
that CVS Health’s concerns with respect to Oak Street Health’s payors and associated price reduction represented an unwarranted reduction in value.
Also on January 17, 2023, representatives of Centerview confirmed to representatives of Kirkland and Oak Street Health’s senior management that
there were no changes to the relationship disclosure letter provided to the Oak Street Health Board on December 13, 2022.
On January 18, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board
with a detailed update on the status of the potential transaction with CVS Health, including CVS Health’s proposed price reduction and the views of the
Transaction Committee members shared with Mr. Pykosz prior to this meeting that Oak Street Health should continue to engage in discussions with CVS
Health to determine if agreement could be reached on a transaction at a value that was in the best interests of Oak Street Health stockholders. The Oak
Street Health Board also discussed potential implications and risks of a deal not being completed, particularly in light of market rumors and the continuing
risks to the business on a standalone basis. Representatives of Centerview delivered a presentation that contained preliminary valuation analyses with
respect to Oak Street Health based on CVS Health’s latest proposal of $38.00 per share. Following discussions among the members of the Oak Street
Health Board of potential responses to CVS Health and mitigation strategies to address any concerns raised by CVS Health, the Oak Street Health Board
instructed senior management to convey to representatives of CVS Health that the Oak Street Health Board would consider proceeding with a transaction
at $40.00 per share. Representatives of Kirkland again reviewed with the Oak Street Health Board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection
with the potential transaction, and summarized the key terms of the current drafts of the Merger Agreement and the form of Voting Agreement, as well as
the key open issues in the then-current draft Merger Agreement, including with respect to provisions in the Merger Agreement related to regulatory
efforts by CVS Health to consummate the transaction, treatment of Oak Street Health equity awards in connection with the transaction, the reverse
termination fee CVS Health would be required to pay in certain instances related to receipt of regulatory clearance for the transaction and the termination
fee Oak Street Health would be required to pay in certain instances relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement relating to an alternative business
combination transaction involving Oak Street Health. Representatives of Kirkland also discussed potential regulatory considerations associated with a
transaction of this kind.

On January 18, 2023, following the Oak Street Health Board meeting, Mr. Pykosz called Ms. Lynch to convey the counterproposal from the Oak
Street Health Board. Ms. Lynch agreed to discuss this counterproposal with the CVS Health Board.
On January 20, 2023, Ms. Lynch contacted Mr. Pykosz to inform him that the CVS Health Board had certain concerns with moving forward with the
potential transaction on the agreed timeline (which, at the time, contemplated an announcement on or around January 23, 2023), due to the proximity to
the pending Medicare Advantage (MA) Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) Program Final Rule (Final Rule) (the “RADV Final Rule”) expected to be
announced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) on or around February 1, 2023. Ms. Lynch communicated to Mr. Pykosz the CVS
Health Board’s desire to postpone entry into any definitive transaction until after the announcement of the RADV Final Rule in light of such concerns.
Mr. Pykosz and Ms. Lynch discussed the potential impact of the RADV Final Rule on Oak Street Health’s business, and Ms. Lynch proposed that any
transaction subsequently entered into be at a price of $39.00 per share. Mr. Pykosz then indicated that he would communicate the revised transaction
terms and timing proposed by CVS Health to the Oak Street Health Board.
Later on January 20, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board
with a detailed update on the status of the potential transaction with CVS Health, including the revised transaction terms proposed by Ms. Lynch earlier
that day. The Oak Street Health Board instructed Mr. Pykosz to convey to Ms. Lynch that, in light of CVS Health’s revised proposal, Oak Street Health
would suspend engagement with CVS Health on any potential transaction, but would be willing to revisit a potential transaction after the issuance of the
RADV Final Rule, with valuation to be discussed at that time.
On January 21, 2023, Mr. Pykosz contacted Ms. Lynch to communicate the Oak Street Health Board’s views on the revised transaction terms
proposed by CVS Health.
On January 30, 2023, CMS issued the RADV Final Rule.
On February 1, 2023, CMS released the 2024 Advance Notice for the Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D Prescription Drug Programs (the
“Advance Notice”).
On February 2, 2023, Ms. Lynch called Mr. Pykosz to inform him that, following the issuance of the RADV Final Rule and the Advance Notice, CVS
Health was prepared to move forward with a transaction at a price of $39.00 per share. Mr. Pykosz indicated that he would communicate the proposal to
the Oak Street Health Board.
Later on February 2, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board
with a detailed update on the status of the potential transaction with CVS Health, including CVS Health’s willingness to proceed with a transaction at
$39.00 per share. Representatives of Centerview delivered a presentation that contained preliminary valuation analyses with respect to Oak Street Health
based on CVS Health’s latest proposal of $39.00 share, based on, among other things, publicly available Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates
regarding Oak Street Health and the Projections. The Oak Street Health Board determined that additional negotiation on price was unlikely to result in an
increased offer from CVS Health and instead could put at risk the potential transaction, which represented an attractive valuation for Oak Street Health
stockholders. The Oak Street Health Board further discussed a number of external risks that could impact Oak Street Health’s business going forward as
well as opportunities and risks relating to growth as a standalone company, following which the Oak Street Health Board instructed Mr. Pykosz to inform
Ms. Lynch that the Oak Street Health Board was prepared to proceed with a transaction at $39.00 per share.
Later on February 2, 2023, Mr. Pykosz contacted Ms. Lynch to deliver the message from the Oak Street Health Board.

of Oak Street Health’s senior management following consummation of the transaction.
On February 6, 2023, the Wall Street Journal published an article reporting that CVS Health was close to an agreement to acquire Oak Street Health
for $39.00 per share.
Later on February 6, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board with a detailed update
on the status of the potential transaction with CVS Health and indicated to the Oak Street Health Board that the key open transaction points had been
resolved. Mr. Pykosz also indicated that the CVS Health Board, subject to Oak Street Health and CVS Health reaching agreement on the key open
transaction points, had approved a transaction at $39.00 per share. The Oak Street Health Board then discussed various matters related to the transaction,
including the underlying rationale for proceeding with a transaction, and a robust discussion ensued regarding general market dynamics, a shifting
competitive and regulatory landscape and related risks and headwinds. Representatives of Centerview reviewed their financial analysis with the Oak
Street Health Board. Representatives of Centerview also confirmed that there were no changes to the relationship disclosure letter provided to the Oak
Street Health Board on December 13, 2022. Representatives of Kirkland provided an overview of the key terms of the draft Merger Agreement and the
Voting Agreements, including key terms on which the parties had achieved resolution, including, among others (i) the efforts that CVS Health is required
to take to obtain regulatory clearance, (ii) the limitations on acquisitions that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially increase the
risk of not obtaining the required antitrust clearance for the transaction, (iii) the quantum of the reverse termination fee payable by CVS Health to Oak
Street Health if regulatory clearance for the transaction is not obtained and the circumstances in which such fee would be payable, (iv) the quantum of
the termination fee Oak Street Health would be required to pay in certain instances relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement relating to an
alternative business combination transaction involving Oak Street Health, and (v) the treatment of Oak Street Health equity awards in connection with the
transaction. The Oak Street Health Board discussed the price and other terms of the Merger Agreement and indicated its support for a transaction on
those terms and instructed Oak Street Health’s senior management and its counsel to finalize the terms of the Merger Agreement and other transaction
documents.
During the course of February 7, 2023, senior management of Oak Street Health and senior management of CVS Health had a number of
conversations about the Advance Notice and the potential impact on Oak Street Health’s business.
On February 7, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health’s senior
management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. Representatives of Centerview reviewed with the Oak Street Health
Board Centerview’s financial analysis of the Merger Consideration, and rendered to the Oak Street Health Board an oral opinion, which was
 
37
Table of Contents
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 7, 2023 that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing
its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Oak Street Health common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Centerview’s opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy
statement titled “— Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC.” A representative of Kirkland described to the Oak Street Health Board the resolutions
proposed to be adopted by the Oak Street Health Board at this meeting. Following prior discussion and consideration of the Merger Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the factors described in the section titled “— Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Oak Street Health Board”), the members of the Oak Street Health Board then unanimously: (1) determined that it was fair to, and
in the best interests of, Oak Street Health and its stockholders, and declared it was advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Oak Street Health, the performance by
Oak Street Health of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation by Oak Street Health of the merger upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein; (3) recommended that the stockholders of Oak Street Health adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with
the DGCL; and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by the Oak Street Health stockholders at a meeting
thereof. The Oak Street Health Board also approved entry into the Voting Agreements and the other documentation and matters relating to the Merger.
On the evening of February 7, 2023, Oak Street Health and CVS Health executed the Merger Agreement and together with affiliates of General
Atlantic, Newlight and certain members of the Oak Street Health Board, the Voting Agreements. On the morning of February 8, 2023, prior to the
commencement of trading of Oak Street Health’s and CVS Health’s common stock on the NYSE, Oak Street Health and CVS Health issued a joint press
release announcing the Merger.",47,60

Recommendation of the Oak Street Health Board
The Oak Street Health Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with Oak Street Health’s senior management
and legal and financial advisors and unanimously: (1) determined that it was fair to, and in the best interests of, Oak Street Health and its stockholders,
and declared it was advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (2) approved the
execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Oak Street Health, the performance by Oak Street Health of its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and the consummation by Oak Street Health of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (3) recommended
that the stockholders of Oak Street Health adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger
Agreement be submitted for consideration by the Oak Street Health stockholders at a meeting thereof. Accordingly, the Oak Street Health Board
unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. 
Reasons for the Merger
In reaching their decision to approve the Merger Agreement and to recommend that Oak Street Health stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement,
the Oak Street Health Board considered the following positive reasons to support its decision:
 
•
the current and historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Oak Street Health common stock,
including the fact that the Merger Consideration of $39.00 per share to be received by Oak Street Health stockholders in the Merger
represents a premium of:
 
38Table of Contents
•
approximately 73% over the closing price per share as of January 9, 2023, the last full trading day prior to Bloomberg’s published
article reporting that CVS Health was exploring an acquisition of Oak Street Health (the “Unaffected Date”);
 
•
approximately 50% over the closing price per share as of February 6, 2023, the most recent full trading day prior to the Oak Street
Health Board meeting to approve the Merger Agreement;
 
•
approximately 82% over the 30-day trading period volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) prior to the Unaffected Date;
 
•
approximately 73% over the 90-day trading period VWAP prior to the Unaffected Date;
 
•
approximately 29% over the highest closing per share price for the 52-week trading period prior to the Unaffected Date;
 
•
the current and prospective business environment in which Oak Street Health operates, including economic, market, regulatory and industry
conditions generally, the current regulatory and competitive environment in the healthcare industry, and the likely effect of these factors on
Oak Street Health and the execution of Oak Street Health’s plans as a standalone public company, including the risks related to Oak Street
Health’s reliance on third party payor relationships to continue to grow its business;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration of $39.00 per share in cash provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to Oak Street Health
stockholders, eliminating the risks and uncertainties inherent in Oak Street Health continuing as a standalone company, taking into account
Oak Street Health’s business, operations, prospects, strategic, short and long-term operating plans, assets and properties, liabilities and
financial condition;
 
•
the risks inherent in operating Oak Street Health’s business in a heavily regulated and competitive industry that is closely scrutinized by
federal, state and local authorities;
 
•
the potential regulatory scrutiny of Oak Street Health’s payor relationships and other strategic partnerships that could adversely impact Oak
Street Health’s business and operations;
 
•
changes in the health insurance industry generally;
 
•
the belief that the Merger Consideration of $39.00 per share in cash was more favorable to Oak Street Health stockholders on a risk-adjusted
basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to Oak Street Health, based upon the Oak Street
Health Board’s extensive knowledge of Oak Street Health’s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, the challenges
facing primary care providers in the current macro-economic and regulatory environment, Oak Street Health’s historical and projected
financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger represented an attractive and comparatively certain value for
Oak Street Health stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted prospects for Oak Street Health on a standalone basis and eliminating long-term
business and execution risk;
 
•
the belief that the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing Oak Street Health stockholders associated with possible strategic
alternatives to the Merger (including possible alternative business combinations and scenarios involving the possibility of remaining a
standalone publicly traded company), and the timing, risks and likelihood of accomplishing such alternatives, taking into account the Oak
Street Health Board’s belief that there were likely no other potential strategic purchasers or other parties that would be reasonably likely to
engage in a transaction in the near term at a price greater than the price being offered by CVS Health (including based on outreach
conducted by Centerview and the absence of any contact from potential acquirors following the release of the articles in Bloomberg on
January 9, 2023 and the Wall Street Journal on February 6, 2023 speculating about a potential strategic transaction involving CVS Health, as
more fully described under the section of this proxy statement titled “— Background of the Merger”);
 
39
Table of Contents
•
the process conducted by Oak Street Health, with the assistance of its advisors, to review other potential strategic alternatives and, in
connection therewith, the engagement with numerous counterparties regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of Oak Street Health,
of which only one submitted a proposal to acquire Oak Street Health that was not at a price comparable to the price being offered by CVS
Health;
 
•
the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with CVS Health in the event Oak Street Health continued to pursue a higher price or in
the event Oak Street Health sought to pursue discussions with other third parties who may be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction
with Oak Street Health prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential negative effect that such a process might have on Oak
Street Health’s business;
 
•
the belief that, after negotiations with CVS Health and its representatives (as described in more detail under the section titled “—
Background of the Merger”), $39.00 per share was the highest price that CVS Health was willing to pay as of the date of execution of the
Merger Agreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to Oak Street Health, in the aggregate, to
which CVS Health would be willing to agree;
 
•
the belief that, if Oak Street Health did not enter into the Merger Agreement with CVS Health, there could be a considerable period of time
before the trading price per share of Oak Street Health’s common stock would reach and sustain the per share price of $39.00, as adjusted for
present value (even assuming full realization of the Projections);
 
•
the opinion of Centerview rendered to the Oak Street Health Board on February 7, 2023, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated February 7, 2023, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Oak Street Health common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described under the section of this proxy statement
titled “— Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC”, which full text of the written opinion of Centerview is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement provides Oak Street Health with sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary
course prior to the consummation of the Merger;
 
•
the high degree of certainty that the Merger would close in a timely manner in light of the conditions to closing the Merger, which the Oak
Street Health Board believes are reasonable, customary and limited in number and scope, and the other terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement, and the requirement that, subject to the limits contained in the Merger Agreement, the parties use their respective reasonable
best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including to obtain all necessary governmental
approvals as promptly as reasonably practicable;
 
•
the commitment made by CVS Health to take all action necessary to avoid or eliminate any impediment to the consummation of the Merger
and obtain all clearances under antitrust laws up to specified thresholds and limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, including a
commitment to defend through litigation any action by any person before a governmental authority and exhausting all avenues of appeal of
any adverse decision or order restraining, preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger prior to the outside date (as extended),
as more further described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger — Reasonable Best Efforts; Antitrust Filings”;
 
•
the ability of the Oak Street Health Board to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in certain circumstances,
and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal upon payment of a termination fee of $300 million by Oak Street
Health (which the Oak Street Health Board believed was reasonable under the circumstances);
 
40
Table of Contents
•
the fact that, in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger in certain circumstances relating to
the failure of regulatory clearance to be obtained, CVS Health will be required to pay Oak Street Health a termination fee of $500 million
(which the Oak Street Health Board believed was reasonable under the circumstances);
 
•
the initial outside date of February 7, 2024 (subject to automatic extension under certain circumstances up to December 23, 2024), allowing
for time that the Oak Street Health Board believed to be sufficient to complete the Merger;
 
•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to Oak Street Health stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL;
 
•
the fact that, taken as a whole, the comprehensive terms of the Merger Agreement, including the respective representations, warranties,
covenants and termination rights and fees of the parties, as finally negotiated are reasonable and customary;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement was approved unanimously by the Oak Street Health Board, which is comprised of a majority of
independent directors who are not employees of Oak Street Health or any of its subsidiaries, and which received advice from the Oak Street
Health’s outside financial and legal advisors in evaluating, negotiating and recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the fact that the consideration and negotiation of the Merger Agreement was conducted through extensive arm’s-length negotiations;
 
•
the fact that the consummation of the Merger is subject to the approval of Oak Street Health’s stockholders, who will have the opportunity
to adopt or reject the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the fact that the adoption of the Merger Agreement is not subject to the approval of CVS Health’s stockholders;
 
•
the fact that certain affiliates of General Atlantic and Newlight and certain members of the Oak Street Health Board, who collectively held
approximately 45.80% of the total outstanding shares of Oak Street Health common stock, agreed to enter into voting and support
agreements to vote their shares in favor of the Merger;
 
•
the fact that the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, and that CVS Health represented to Oak Street Health in the Merger
Agreement that CVS Health will have cash and other available funds sufficient to consummate the Merger and satisfy all of its obligations
under the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the fact that, in the Oak Street Health Board’s judgment, the Merger is likely to generate significant synergy value for CVS Health, which the
Oak Street Health Board believed contributed to CVS Health’s willingness and ability to offer $39.00 per share, and the Oak Street Health
Board’s belief that a transaction with another strategic acquiror might not generate comparable synergy value;
 
•
Oak Street Health’s rights to specific performance under the terms of the Merger Agreement; and
 
•
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, in light of the business reputation and financial capabilities of CVS Health and its
affiliates, including CVS Health’s prior track record of completing large and complex acquisitions.
In the course of its deliberations, the Oak Street Health Board also considered, among other things, the following negative factors:
 
•
the fact that Oak Street Health stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth potential or benefit from any future increase
in the value of Oak Street Health following completion of the Merger, particularly in light of Oak Street Health’s strong and improving
financial performance;
 
41
Table of Contents
•
the fact that the potential outside date is as late as December 23, 2024 (if extended) and Oak Street Health stockholders could be asked to
vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement well in advance of the completion of the Merger;
 
•
the possibility that all conditions to the Merger will not be timely satisfied or waived and that the Merger will not be consummated, and the
potential negative effects on Oak Street Health’s business, operations, financial results and stock price;
 
•
the potential negative effects of the public announcement and pendency of the Merger on Oak Street Health’s operating results, business
model transition, its ability to retain key management and other personnel, and its relationships with employees, customers, payors,
suppliers and partners;
 
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Oak Street Health’s business prior to the completion of the Merger, requiring Oak Street Health to conduct
its business in the ordinary course and preventing Oak Street Health from taking certain specified actions, subject to specific limitations, all
of which may delay or prevent Oak Street Health from undertaking business opportunities pending completion of the Merger;
 
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger (many of which are
payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time and effort of Oak Street Health management and employees
required to complete the Merger and potential diversion of their attention away from the day-to-day operations of Oak Street Health’s
business as a result thereof, each of which may disrupt Oak Street Health’s business operations and have a negative effect on its financial
results;
 
•
the conditions to the obligations of CVS Health to complete the Merger and the right of CVS Health to terminate the Merger Agreement
under certain circumstances;
 
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement precludes Oak Street Health from actively soliciting alternative acquisition proposals, and the
possibility that Oak Street Health may be obligated to pay CVS Health a termination fee of $300 million in the event that Oak Street Health
terminates the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;
 
•
the fact that, in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger in certain circumstances relating to
the failure of antitrust clearance to be obtained, CVS Health will be required to pay Oak Street Health a termination fee of $500 million, which
may not be sufficient to compensate Oak Street Health for losses suffered as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement under
such circumstances;
 
•
the risk that Oak Street Health’s stockholders may not approve the Merger;
 
•
the fact that completion of the Merger requires regulatory clearance, which could subject the Merger to delays and the risk that the required
regulatory clearance may not be obtained at all;
 
•
the risk of litigation arising from stockholders in respect of the Merger Agreement or transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the fact that the consideration consists of cash and will therefore be taxable to Oak Street Health stockholders who are subject to taxation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 
•
the interests that certain Oak Street Health directors and executive officers may have with respect to the Merger, in addition to their interests
as Oak Street Health stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “— Interests of Oak Street Health’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”; and
 
•
other risks and uncertainties of the nature identified in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” and in
Oak Street Health’s filings with the SEC, including the risks set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Oak Street Health’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can
Find More Information.”

Table of Contents
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Oak Street Health Board concluded that the risks, uncertainties,
restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were outweighed by the
positive factors and potential benefits associated with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby that supported its
determination and recommendation. Accordingly, the Oak Street Health Board unanimously determined that it was fair to, and in the best interests of Oak
Street Health and its stockholders, and declared it was advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement.
The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by the Oak Street Health Board is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. In
light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Oak Street Health
Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to rank or assign relative weights to the various factors considered in
reaching their respective determinations. In considering the factors described above and any other factors, individual members of the Oak Street Health
Board may have viewed factors differently or given different weight, merit or consideration to different factors. In addition, the Oak Street Health Board
did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or
unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Oak Street Health Board, but rather the Oak Street Health Board conducted an overall review of the
factors described above, including discussions with Oak Street Health’s senior management and legal and financial advisors.
The foregoing discussion of the reasoning of the Oak Street Health Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in
nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section of this proxy statement titled “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Oak Street Health Board in connection with
Centerview’s opinion, dated February 7, 2023. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses
performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of, Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the
relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable
than other assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be taken to be
Centerview’s view of the actual value of the Company. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below include information presented in
tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do
not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the tables below without considering
all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
such analyses or factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In
performing its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company or any other parties to the Transactions. None of Oak Street Health, CVS Health or

or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth
below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the Company do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the Company may actually
be sold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it
existed on or before February 6, 2023 and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Selected Public Company Analysis
Centerview reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for the Company to corresponding financial information,
ratios and multiples for certain publicly traded companies that Centerview deemed comparable, based on its experience and professional judgment, to the
Company (which selected publicly traded companies are referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “selected Company comparison
companies”). The selected Company comparison companies consisted of:
 
•
Agilon Health, Inc. (NYSE: AGL)
 
•
Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMEH)
 
•
Cano Health, Inc. (NYSE: CANO)
 
•
CareMax, Inc. (NASDAQ: CMAX)
 
•
Privia Health Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRVA)
Although none of the selected Company comparison companies used in this analysis is directly comparable to Oak Street Health, these companies
were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with certain operational and financial characteristics, which, for
purposes of its analyses, Centerview considered to be similar to those of the Company. However, because none of the selected Company comparison
companies is exactly the same as the Company, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative
results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional
judgment, concerning differences between the business, financial and operational characteristics and prospects of the Company and the selected
Company comparison companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the
quantitative analysis.
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings, Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates and other data sources as of
February 6, 2023, Centerview calculated, for each of the selected Company comparison companies the following figures, ratios and multiples, (i) enterprise
value (calculated as the market value of common equity determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money
options, other equity awards and other convertible securities, as applicable, plus debt and less cash, after giving effect to certain adjustments for minority
interest and contingent consideration), and (ii) enterprise value as a multiple of projected revenue for the calendar year ended 2023. These analyses
resulted in a mean and median multiple of enterprise value to projected revenue for calendar year 2023 of 1.1x and 0.9x, respectively, in each case, for such
selected the Company comparison companies.

Based on its analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience, Centerview selected a
reference range of enterprise value to projected revenue multiples for the calendar year 2023 of 1.8x to 2.2x. In selecting this reference range, Centerview
made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operational
characteristics of the Company and the selected Company comparison companies that could affect their public trading values in order to provide a
context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. These qualitative judgments related, among other things, to the differing sizes,
growth prospects, and commercial profiles and degree of operational risk between the Company and such comparable companies. Centerview applied the
revenue multiple reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for the calendar year 2023 of $3,289 million, as set forth in the Internal Data, to
derive a range of implied equity values for the Company. Centerview then divided these implied equity values by the number of fully-diluted shares of
Oak Street Health common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options and restricted
stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units)) as of February 3, 2023 as set forth in the Internal Data, resulting in an implied per share
equity value range for the shares of Oak Street Health common stock of approximately $21.50 to $26.50 (rounded to the nearest $0.10). Centerview then
compared this range to the $39.00 per share in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to the holders of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock
(other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, the selected transactions listed below were selected, among other
reasons, based on Centerview’s experience and professional judgment, because the selected transactions have certain characteristics that, for the
purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain characteristics of the Merger. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of
the selected transactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of the
Company and the target companies included in the selected transactions analysis. This analysis involved complex considerations and qualitative
judgments concerning differences in business, operational, and/or financial characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading,
acquisition or other values of the selected target companies and the Company. However, because none of the selected transactions used in this analysis
is identical or directly comparable to the Merger, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative
results of the selected transaction analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional
judgment, concerning differences between the operational, business or financial characteristics of the Company and each target company in the selected
transactions as well as the Merger and the selected transactions that could affect the transaction values of each in order to provide a context in which to
consider the results of the quantitative analysis.
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of the time of the announcement of the selected
transactions, Centerview calculated, for each selected transaction, among other
 
48
Table of Contents
things, the enterprise value implied by the transaction for the applicable target company based on the consideration payable in the applicable selected
transaction (calculated as the offer value (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options,
warrants, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities), plus the book value of debt and certain liabilities less cash and
cash equivalents and excluding any contingent consideration), as a multiple of the target company’s revenue for the last 12-month period as of the time of
the transaction announcement (which is referred to as “LTM”) (such multiple is referred to, with respect to the selected transaction, as the “EV/LTM
Revenue Multiple”), for which financial information had been made public at the time of the announcement of such transactions, except as otherwise
noted.
Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the target companies in the selected transactions and other considerations that Centerview
deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience, Centerview selected a reference range of EV/LTM Revenue Multiples of 3.0x to 5.0x. In
selecting this reference range, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between
the business, financial and operational characteristics and prospects of Oak Street Health and the target companies included in the selected transactions
and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of such companies or the Company.
Centerview applied this reference range to the Company’s estimated 2022 revenue of $2,165 million as set forth in the Internal Data, to derive a
range of implied equity values for the Company. Centerview then divided these implied equity values by the number of fully-diluted outstanding shares
of Oak Street Health common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options and
restricted stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units)) as of February 3, 2023 as set forth in the Internal Data, an implied per share
equity value range for the shares of Oak Street Health common stock of $23.70 to $40.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.10). Centerview then compared this
range to the $39.00 per share in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to the holders of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock (other than
the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on the Forecasts, as set forth in the Internal Data as further
described below under the section entitled “The Merger — Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement and the
calculations of after-tax unlevered free cash flows based thereon. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a
valuation of an asset or set of assets by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. “Present value” refers
to the current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows by a discount rate that takes into account
macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated implied enterprise values for Oak Street Health by discounting to present value as of December
31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 11.25% to 13.50% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of the Oak Street Health’s weighted average cost of
capital), the forecasted unlevered free cash flows of the Company based on Forecasts during the period beginning the first quarter of 2023, and ending in
December 2028 and extrapolation beginning the first quarter of 2029, and ending in December 2037, and forecasted use of federal and state net operating
loss (“NOL”) carryforwards through 2032. The implied terminal value of Oak Street Health at the end of the forecast period was estimated by using
perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Centerview
then subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values Oak Street Health’s estimated net debt (calculated as debt less cash and investments) as of
December 31, 2022 as set forth in the Internal Data, to derive a range of implied equity values for Oak Street Health.
Centerview then divided this range of implied equity values by the number of fully-diluted outstanding shares of Oak Street Health common stock
(determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account
 
49
Table of Contents
outstanding in-the-money options and restricted stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units)) as set forth in the Internal Data
(calculated as of February 3, 2023) to derive a range of implied values of Oak Street Health common stock of $29.50 to $48.30 (rounded to the nearest
$0.10) per share, inclusive of the NOLs. Centerview then compared this range to the $39.00 per share in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to the
holders of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock (other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Other Factors
Centerview noted for the Oak Street Health Board certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other things, the
following:
 
•
Illustrative Discounted Future Share Price Analysis: Centerview calculated and compared an illustrative implied present value of the future
prices of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock based on the Internal Data. This analysis was designed to provide an indication of
the present value of a theoretical future price of the Company’s equity calculated as a multiple of forward revenue. Centerview applied one-
year forward revenue multiples of 1.8x, 2.0x, and 2.2x to the Company’s estimated 2024 to 2028 revenue, projected net debt based on the
Internal Data to calculate the Company’s equity value, and discounted the derived equity value using a cost of equity equal to 13.5% on a
present value basis to December 31, 2022. Based on its analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its
professional judgment and experience, Centerview selected a one-year forward revenue multiple of 2.0x as a reference range, which implied a
per share price range of $33.70 to $45.20 (rounded to the nearest $0.10). Centerview compared this range to the $39.00 per share in cash,
without interest, proposed to be paid to the holders of shares of Oak Street Health common stock (other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant
to the Merger Agreement.
 
•
Analyst Price Target Range Analysis: Centerview reviewed stock price targets for the shares of Oak Street Health common stock in publicly
available Wall Street research analyst reports as of January 9, 2023 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of the
shares was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction) which indicated low and high stock price targets for the
Company ranging from $22.00 to $43.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.10), and a mean of $30.62, per share.
 
•
Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis: Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of shares of Oak Street Health common stock
during the LTM period ending on January 9, 2023 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of the shares was
perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction), which reflected low and high stock prices for shares during such period
of $14.10 to $30.30 (rounded to the nearest $0.10) per share;
 
•
Premiums Paid Analysis: Centerview performed an analysis of premiums paid or payable in certain change of control transactions involving
publicly traded target companies occurring since 2017 and valued over $5 billion, for which premium data was available and which
Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience in order to compare the premium paid over Oak Street Health’s
present and historical share prices to that paid in such past transactions. For each such transaction, Centerview calculated the premiums in
this analysis by comparing the per share acquisition price in each transaction, in each case in reference to certain values as of the last
trading date prior to the date on which the trading price of the target’s common stock was perceived to be affected by a potential
transaction (the “Reference Date”) including the: (i) closing stock price of the target company’s common stock as of the Reference Date, (ii)
30 day volume weighted average price prior to the Reference Date, (iii) 90 day volume weighted average price prior to the Reference Date,
and (iv) 52-week high prior to the Reference Date. Based on the foregoing analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed
relevant in its professional judgment and experience, Centerview applied to the Company’s closing stock price on January 9, 2023 (the last
trading date prior to the date on which the trading price of Oak Street Health common stock was perceived to be affected by a potential
transaction) of $22.57 a reference range of, respectively for each of the aforementioned
 
50
Table of Contents
premium ranges in clauses (i)-(iv) above, (i) 30% to 40%, (ii) 35% to 45%, (iii) 35% to 45%, and (iv) 10% to 25%, which resulted in implied
price ranges of (i) $29.30 to $31.60, (ii) $28.90 to $31.10, (iii) $30.40 to $32.70, and (iv) $33.30 to $37.90 (each rounded to the nearest $0.10),
respectively, per share of Oak Street Health common stock.
General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or
analysis that it considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of the analyses.
Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Oak Street Health Board in its
evaluation of the Transactions. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Oak Street Health
Board or management of the Company with respect to the Merger Consideration or as to whether the Oak Street Health Board would have been willing to
determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Oak
Street Health and CVS Pharmacy and was approved by the Oak Street Health Board. Centerview provided advice to the Company during these
negotiations. Centerview did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to Oak Street Health or the Oak Street Health Board or that
any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction.
Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory
and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, except for Centerview’s current engagement in respect of the
Transactions, Centerview was not engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the Company, and Centerview did not receive any
compensation from the Company during such period. Centerview is currently engaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to
a portfolio company of General Atlantic (affiliates of which own approximately 25% of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock), and Centerview
may receive compensation from such company in the future. In 2022, Centerview’s restructuring team was engaged to provide financial advisory services
unrelated to the Company to a portfolio company of General Atlantic in connection with certain restructuring-related matters, and Centerview received
compensation from such company. In 2021, Centerview was engaged to provide financial advisory services to Landmark Health, LLC (“Landmark Health”)
in connection with its sale to UnitedHealth Group, at which time General Atlantic was the majority owner of Landmark Health, and Centerview received
compensation from Landmark Health for such services. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview received aggregate fees of
between $45,000,000 and $55,000,000 in connection with the foregoing matters. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview was
not engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to CVS Health, and Centerview did not receive any compensation from CVS Health during
such period. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company, CVS Health, General Atlantic or their
respective affiliates, including portfolio companies of General Atlantic, in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of
Centerview and Centerview’s affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or
related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may
co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or
other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, CVS Health, General Atlantic or any of their respective affiliates, including portfolio companies of
General Atlantic, or any other party that may be involved in the Transactions.
The Oak Street Health Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transactions based on Centerview’s qualifications,

"Oak Street Health, Inc._20230330_DEFM14A_20760527_4632592.Pdf",Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
In our press releases announcing quarterly and annual results, Oak Street Health has historically prepared and provided certain public guidance as
to its projected financial and operational results for its then-current fiscal quarter and fiscal year. Oak Street Health does not otherwise, as a matter of
course, make long-term projections as to future performance available to the public (other than in certain limited circumstances), given, among other
things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may
not be realized.
However, in connection with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, as described further in the section of this proxy statement titled “The
Merger — Background of the Merger”, Oak Street Health’s management team prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for Oak Street
Health for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2028 (the “Projections”). The Company’s senior management also prepared
extrapolations of the Projections for fiscal years 2029 through 2037 and certain analyses related to the expected utilization of federal and state NOL
carryforwards through 2032, which were provided to Centerview for purposes of its financial analyses summarized in the section above titled “— Opinion
of Centerview.”
The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of
the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information or generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has not compiled,
examined, audited or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections, and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance
regarding this information or its achievability.
The Projections summarized below are included solely to provide Oak Street Health stockholders access to financial projections that were made
available to the Oak Street Health Board, the Transaction Committee, Centerview and CVS Health in connection with the proposed Merger, and are not
included in this proxy statement to influence an Oak Street Health stockholder’s decision as to whether to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement or for any
other purpose.
None of the Company, the Oak Street Health Board, Centerview, CVS Health or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives
makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections or the ultimate
performance of the Company relative to the Projections. The inclusion of the summary of the Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an
admission or representation of the Company, the Oak Street Health Board, Centerview, CVS Health or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other
representatives that the Projections or the information contained therein are material. The inclusion of the summary of the Projections in this proxy
statement should not be regarded as an indication that Oak Street Health or anyone who receives the Projections then considered, or now considers, the
Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In the view of Oak Street Health’s
management, the Projections were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best estimates and judgments available to Oak Street Health’s
management at the
 
52Table of Contents
time and presented, to the best of Oak Street Health’s management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and Oak Street Health’s
expected future financial performance as of the date such information was prepared.
The Projections summarized below, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables and assumptions that necessarily
involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult
or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond Oak Street Health’s control. In addition, the Projections reflect assumptions that are subject to
change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations based on actual results, revised prospects for Oak Street Health’s business, changes in general
business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when the
Projections were prepared. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the Projections, and therefore, the
Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon as such.
The Projections reflect the assumption that the Company will open 35 new primary care centers per year for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, and 40 new
primary care centers per year for fiscal years 2022 and 2025 through 2028. The Projections also reflect other assumptions that are subject to change,
including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding: primary care center membership mix; market share; market size and conditions; revenue; medical
costs; operating expenses; capital expenditures; and net working capital. The Projections cover multiple years, and thus, by their nature, they become
subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year.
The Projections assume organic company growth without business expansions from mergers and acquisitions or alternative business models. In
addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the Projections were
prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses incurred after the date on which they were made, including as a result of the Merger or any
effects of the Merger (including any failure of the Merger to be completed).
Except as required by applicable securities laws, Oak Street Health does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the date on which the Projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all
of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. There can be no assurance that the financial results in the Projections will be realized, or that
future actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the Projections. In light of the foregoing, and the uncertainties inherent in
the Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections. The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding Oak Street Health in its public filings with the SEC.
Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of the Projections include, but are not limited to: regulatory actions at the
federal, state and local level, decisions of health network providers, enterprise clients and existing and potential patients, changes in the health insurance
industry, general economic conditions, including COVID-19, and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital, credit or securities markets; industry and
market dynamics; competition; and those risks and uncertainties described in Oak Street Health’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. See also the section entitled “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this proxy statement.
Certain of the measures included in the Projections are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP
financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by
other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures, because they exclude charges and credits that are required
to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,
financial measures prepared in accordance with
 
53
Table of Contents
GAAP. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the SEC’s rules concerning non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, are
not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the
Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared or relied upon by the Oak Street Health Board
in connection with its consideration of the Merger Agreement or by Centerview for purposes of its financial analyses. Accordingly, the Company has not
provided a reconciliation of any financial measures included in the Projections.

If the Merger Proposal is approved and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into Oak Street Health upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. As the surviving corporation in the Merger, Oak Street Health will
continue to exist following the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Pharmacy.

current stockholders will have any direct ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, Oak Street Health, the surviving corporation or CVS Pharmacy after
the consummation of the Merger. As a result, Oak Street Health’s current stockholders will no longer have the potential to benefit from any increase in the
value, nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Oak Street Health common stock. Following the Merger, CVS Pharmacy will have the
potential to benefit from any increase in Oak Street Health’s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in Oak Street Health’s value.

Oak Street Health common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “OSH”. Following
the consummation of the Merger, shares of Oak Street Health common stock will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, the registration of shares of Oak
Street Health common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated and Oak Street Health will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports
with the SEC with respect to its common stock. Termination of the registration of Oak Street Health common stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the
information required to be furnished by Oak Street Health to its stockholders and the SEC, and will make provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the
requirement to file annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Oak Street Health.

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by Oak Street Health stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Oak Street Health
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Oak Street Health common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Oak Street Health
will remain an independent public company, Oak Street Health common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE, Oak Street Health
common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, Oak Street Health will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with
respect to its common stock and Oak Street Health stockholders will continue to own their shares of Oak Street Health common stock and will continue to
be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of Oak Street Health common stock.
If the Merger is not completed, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of Oak
Street Health common stock, including the risk that the market price of Oak Street Health common stock may decline to the extent that the current market
price of Oak Street Health common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed, there is no
assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business, operations, financial condition, earnings or
prospects of the Company will not be adversely affected. Under certain specified circumstances, Oak Street Health may be required to pay CVS Pharmacy
a termination fee in the amount of $300 million (the “Company Termination Fee”) or CVS Pharmacy may be required to pay Oak Street Health a termination
fee in the amount of $500 million (the “CVS Termination Fee”). Please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement —

CVS Health common stock, and such Assumed RSA will provide that the unvested portion, if any, of such Assumed RSA will immediately vest and settle

Time.
Quantification of Potential Payments for Equity Awards
The table below sets forth (i) the number of Options, RSAs and RSUs, as applicable, as of March 20, 2023, the assumed date of the consummation
of the Merger solely for the purposes of this disclosure, and held by each executive officer of Oak Street Health and each non-employee member of the
Oak Street Health Board, and (ii) the estimated value of those awards (on a pre-tax basis). These values have been calculated assuming the price of a
share of Oak Street Health common stock is $39.00, which represents the per share price of the Merger Consideration. The actual value realized with
respect to any Options, RSAs or RSUs cannot be determined with any certainty until the awards are settled. For purposes of this table, we have assumed
that the employment of all executive officers will terminate immediately following the Merger (based on an assumed closing date of March 20, 2023).

Severance Entitlements
Each of Messrs. Pykosz, Price, Cook, Guenthner and Dr. Myers is party to an employment agreement (each referred to as an “employment
agreement”) that provides for certain severance payments and benefits in connection with certain terminations of employment.
Mr. Pykosz’s, Mr. Price’s and Dr. Myers’ employment agreements provide that, upon termination of employment by Oak Street Health without
“cause” or upon a resignation for “good reason” (together an “Executive Qualifying Termination”), the executive officer will be entitled to receive a
monthly severance payment equal to 1/12 of the annualized average of the last three years of his respective base salary plus bonus for up to three years.
For Mr. Pykosz, Mr. Price and Dr. Myers, Oak Street Health may elect to pay the severance above for a period of less than three years (but no less than
one year) by giving notice to the executive officer, at which point both the severance payments and the executive officer’s obligations under the non-
competition and non-solicitation provisions of the employment agreement will immediately cease. Mr. Guenthner’s employment agreement provides that,
upon an Executive Qualifying Termination, he will be entitled to receive severance, payable in equal monthly installments for a minimum of 12 months
(and up to 36 months if Oak Street Health elects to continue his restrictive covenants beyond 12 months), in an amount equal to the sum of his then
current base salary and the average of the last two discretionary bonuses paid to him prior to such termination of employment. In addition, upon an
Executive Qualifying Termination, Mr. Guenthner (and his eligible dependents, if applicable) will be entitled to continued coverage under any health,
medical, dental, vision or life insurance program or policy in which he participated as of the date of such termination, at the same cost to him as if he
remained an active employee during the 12-month period following such an Executive Qualifying Termination.
Mr. Cook’s employment agreement provides that, upon an Executive Qualifying Termination, he will be entitled to monthly severance payments for
a period of 12 months equal to 160% of his base salary then in effect.
For purposes of Mr. Pykosz’s, Mr. Price’s and Dr. Myers’ employment agreements, as modified by the Merger Agreement, “cause” means the
executive officer’s (subject to certain notice and cure provisions): (i) conviction (including a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere) of any crime or
offense that constitutes a felony under federal or state law or other crime involving moral turpitude or any other act or omission involving fraud with
respect to the Company; (ii) commission of an act of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, in each case, resulting in any material detriment to the
Company; (iii) knowingly aiding or abetting a competitor, supplier or customer of the Company in a manner that would violate the duty of loyalty to the
Company, whether or not such duty applies to the executive officer; (iv) failure to comply with the lawful direction of the Oak Street Health Board, the
written company policies, or a material breach of any provision of the employment agreement (other than due to physical or mental incapacity) or (v)
violation of the Company’s or CVS Pharmacy’s (or any of their respective affiliates’) code of conduct, to the extent that such a termination of employment
for “cause” is consistent with CVS Pharmacy’s standard human resources policies and procedures.
For purposes of Mr. Guenthner’s and Mr. Cook’s employment agreements as modified by the Merger Agreement, “cause” is limited to the executive
officer’s: (i) engagement in a felony or other crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; (ii) fraud, embezzlement, theft or any misappropriation of
funds, money, assets or other property of the Company or any of its affiliates; (iii) willful failure to perform duties, or gross negligence in the performance
of the executive officer’s duties and responsibilities to the Company and its affiliates, or willful failure to follow the lawful directive of the Oak Street
Health Board or such other person or body to whom the executive office reports, which remains uncured 10 days after written notice of such failure or
negligence specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such failure or negligence is given to the executive by the Company or its affiliates; (iv) material
breach of the employment agreement or any other written agreement between the executive officer and the Company or its affiliates; (v) attempt to
willfully obtain any personal profit from any transaction in which the executive officer has an interest not disclosed to the Oak Street Health Board which
is adverse to the interests of the Company or any of its controlled affiliates or (vi) violation of the Company’s or CVS Pharmacy’s (or any of their
respective affiliates’) code of conduct, to the extent that such a termination of employment for Cause is consistent with CVS Pharmacy’s standard human
resources policies and procedures.

Table of Contents
For purposes of Mr. Pykosz’s, Mr. Price’s and Dr. Myers’ employment agreements as modified by the Merger Agreement, “good reason” means
occurrence of any of the following events (subject to certain notice and cure provisions): (i) a material diminution in executive officer’s duties and/or
responsibilities (except that is solely a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the fact that
Oak Street Health is no longer publicly traded)); (ii) a material reduction in executive officer’s total annual compensation opportunity (which includes
base salary, target annual incentive bonus opportunity and target annual long-term equity incentive opportunity); (iii) a material relocation of executive
officer’s principal base of operation (other than for temporary assignments with the prior consent of the executive officer); or (iv) any other material
breach of the employment agreement by the Company (except that is solely a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (including the fact that Oak Street Health is no longer publicly traded)).
For purposes of Mr. Guenthner’s and Mr. Cook’s employment agreements as modified by the Merger Agreement, “good reason” is limited to
(subject to certain notice and cure provisions): (i) a material reduction in the executive officer’s total annual compensation opportunity (which includes
base salary, target annual incentive bonus opportunity and target annual long-term equity incentive opportunity); (ii) a material and adverse diminution in
the executive officer’s title, duties and responsibilities or material change in reporting relationship (by position) (except that is solely a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the fact that Oak Street Health is no longer publicly traded)); (iii) a
relocation of the executive officer’s principal place of work in excess of 50 miles from the current location other than a relocation that is not in bad faith; or
(iv) any material breach by the Company of the employment agreement (except that is solely a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the fact that Oak Street Health is no longer publicly traded)), other than any isolated and inadvertent
failure by the Company that is not in bad faith.
The foregoing severance payments and benefits under the executive agreements are subject to the delivery of an effective separation and release
agreement by the executive officer containing, among other provisions, a general release of claims in favor of the Company. None of the executive
agreements provide for any tax gross-up payments.
Mr. Clem is not party to an employment agreement that provides for severance or termination benefits. However, the Merger Agreement provides
that, if an executive officer has no severance protection in their employment agreement, then upon a termination of employment by Oak Street Health
without “cause” or upon a resignation for “good reason”, in each case, that occurs within 12 months following the closing of the Merger, the executive
officer will be entitled to (i) salary continuation payments for 12 months of his base salary then in effect and (ii) payment or reimbursement of the
employer portion of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) premiums for the executive officer and his eligible dependents, based
the executive officer’s coverage levels in effect immediately prior to the date of such executive officer’s termination of employment, for an amount of time
equal to the 12-month period following his termination of employment. The foregoing severance payments and benefits under the Merger Agreement are
subject to the delivery of an effective separation and release agreement by the executive officer containing, among other provisions, a general release of
claims in favor of the Company and its subsidiaries.
For purposes of this proxy statement, “cause”, with respect to an executive officer, means: (i) if the executive officer is party to an employment
agreement that defines “cause” (or terms of like import), the meaning set forth in such agreement or (ii) in any other case, “cause” will have the meaning
set forth in the Omnibus Plan, as in effect on February 7, 2023; provided that with respect to each of clause (i) and (ii), an executive officer’s violation of
Oak Street Health’s or CVS Pharmacy’s (or any of their respective affiliates’) code of conduct will constitute an additional grounds for termination of
employment or service for “cause”, to the extent that such a termination of employment for “cause” is consistent with CVS Pharmacy’s standard human
resources policies and procedures.
 
63
Table of Contents
For purposes of this proxy statement, “good reason”, with respect to an executive officer, means: subject to certain notice and cure provisions, (i) if
the executive officer is party to an employment agreement, unless otherwise agreed upon between such executive officer and Oak Street Health or CVS
Pharmacy, the meaning set forth in the employment agreement; provided, that, unless otherwise agreed upon between such executive officer and Oak
Street Health or CVS Pharmacy, for purposes of such agreement, the definition of “good reason” will be deemed to include a material reduction in the
executive officer’s total annual compensation opportunity (which includes base salary, target annual incentive bonus opportunity and target annual long-
term equity incentive opportunity), subject to such executive officer’s agreement to waive “good reason” on account of any (a) reduction of such
executive officer’s title, duties or responsibilities or adverse change in reporting relationship or (b) material breach of such employment agreement, in
each case, that is solely a result of the consummation of the Merger (including the fact that Oak Street Health is no longer publicly traded) so long as
such executive officer has substantially the same duties and responsibilities with respect to Oak Street Health’s business that such executive officer had
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but without regard to the fact that Oak Street Health is no longer publicly traded) or (ii) in any other case, the
occurrence of any of the following (without the executive officer’s written consent): (a) a material reduction in the executive officer’s total annual
compensation opportunity (which includes base salary, target annual incentive bonus opportunity and target annual long-term equity incentive
opportunity); (b) a material and adverse diminution in the executive officer’s duties and responsibilities; provided, that in no event will the reduction of
an executive officer’s duties or responsibilities solely by virtue of the Merger in and of itself constitute grounds for “good reason” so long as the
executive officer has substantially the same duties and responsibilities with respect to Oak Street Health’s business that the executive officer had
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but without regard to the fact that Oak Street Health is no longer publicly traded); or (c) a relocation of the
executive officer’s principal place of work in excess of 50 miles from the executive officer’s principal place of work (excluding any remote work
arrangement) as of the Effective Time.
The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits for each of the named executive officers of Oak Street Health is set forth below in the
table entitled “— Quantification of Payments and Benefits.”
Transaction and Retention Bonuses
Under the Merger Agreement, Oak Street Health may make awards of transaction and retention bonuses to each of the officers, employees,
directors and independent contractors of Oak Street Health and its subsidiaries (“Service Providers”), subject to certain terms and conditions (including
continued employment or service through the applicable payment date). As of the date of this proxy statement, Oak Street Health has not made any
grants of transaction or retention bonuses to any of its executive officers or directors.
280G Mitigation Actions
Under the Merger Agreement, Oak Street Health may, in consultation with CVS Pharmacy, implement strategies before the Effective Time to mitigate
the amount of potential “excess parachute payments” for “disqualified individuals” (each as defined in Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”)), including the executive officers, except that without the consent of CVS Pharmacy, (i) the vesting and payment of any
compensation, award or benefit of any disqualified individual may not be accelerated and (ii) Oak Street Health may not provide for different treatment of
the disqualified individuals’ equity awards than that set forth in the Merger Agreement. As of the date of this proxy statement, Oak Street Health has not
yet approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of Section 280G of the Code on Oak Street Health or any disqualified individuals. No executive
officer is entitled to receive gross-ups or tax reimbursements from Oak Street Health with respect to any potential excise taxes.
Oak Street Health Non-Employee Director Compensation
Under the Merger Agreement, Oak Street Health may continue to pay non-employee members of the Oak Street Health Board their annual fees,
retainers, reimbursements and stipends, in each case, without proration and in
 
64
Table of Contents
accordance with the terms of the Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy. As described above in the section entitled “Interests of Oak Street
Health’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” all RSUs and Options held by non-employee directors will accelerate and fully vest “single-
trigger” in connection with the closing of the Merger.
Other Interests
Other Interests
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our directors or executive officers has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
with CVS Health or any of its affiliates regarding employment or service with, or compensation following the Merger to be paid by, CVS Health or any of
its affiliates. However, prior to the closing of the Merger, our directors or executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements, arrangements or
understandings with CVS Health or any of its affiliates regarding employment or service with, or compensation following the Merger, to be paid by CVS
Health or any of its affiliates.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits

prior to the completion of the Merger, (vi) each of the named executive officers’ performance-based RSUs that are expected to vest in accordance with
their terms in March 2023 will vest and settle in accordance with their terms prior to the completion of the Merger, (vii) for purposes of determining the
value of Options, RSAs and RSUs, the value of a share of Oak Street Health common stock is equal to $39.00, (viii) no named executive officer receives
any additional equity grants prior to completion of the Merger, and (ix) each named executive officer has properly executed any required releases and
complied with all requirements (including any applicable restrictive covenants) necessary in order to receive the payments and benefits described below.

Represents 12 months of severance, based on the default provision of Mr. Guenthner’s employment agreement. Mr. Guenthner’s employment
agreement also provides that the Company may, in its discretion, elect to pay up to 36 months of severance in exchange for a corresponding
extension in the duration of Mr. Guenthner’s post-employment non-competition and non-solicitation obligations.

The amounts in the “Equity” column attributable to time-based Options, RSAs and time-based RSUs are considered to be “double-trigger,” which
means that both a “Change in Control” of Oak Street Health, such as the Merger, and a qualifying termination of employment must occur (within 12
months following the consummation of the Merger for time-based Options, RSAs and time-based RSUs) in order for the vesting of any such time-based
Options, RSAs and time-based RSUs to be accelerated and for the applicable named executive officer to receive a payment in respect of the time-based
Options, RSAs and time-based RSUs prior to the regularly scheduled vesting date(s). The amounts in this column attributable to performance-based
Options are considered to be “single-trigger,” which means that the vesting of these awards is accelerated and payable upon a “Change in Control” of
Oak Street Health, regardless of whether such named executive officer’s employment is terminated. The estimated amount of each such payment is set
forth in the table below.

Potential Future Arrangements
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of the executive officers of Oak Street Health has entered into any agreement with CVS Health or any
of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, CVS Health or one or more of its affiliates. However,
prior to or following the closing of the Merger, certain executive officers of Oak Street Health may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with,
CVS Health, Oak Street Health or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, CVS Health
or one or more of its affiliates.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Oak Street Health’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. See “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification of Directors and

The following discussion summarizes certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to Oak Street Health stockholders who
receive cash in exchange for shares of Oak Street Health common stock pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is for general informational purposes
only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the
Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation
could affect the accuracy of the statements set forth herein. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have
not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (referred to herein as the “IRS”) regarding any of the tax issues
discussed herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge, or that a court will not agree with such a challenge with respect to, one or
more of the tax consequences of the Merger described in this proxy statement.
This discussion assumes that Oak Street Health stockholders hold their shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular
Oak Street Health stockholder in light of such holder’s individual circumstances, nor does it address U.S. state or local, non-U.S., or estate or gift taxes,
alternative minimum taxes, the rules regarding qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Code, the Medicare tax on net
investment income or any other aspect of any U.S. federal tax other than the income tax. This discussion also does not address tax considerations that
may be relevant to Oak Street Health stockholders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial
institutions, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, mutual funds, partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, S corporations, tax-exempt organizations, governmental
organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market method of accounting,
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, U.S.
expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired their Oak Street Health common stock through the
exercise of Oak Street Health stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who hold their Oak Street Health common stock as part of a hedge,
straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, real estate
investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders deemed to sell their shares of Oak Street Health common stock under the constructive sale
provisions of the Code, persons who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) an equity interest in CVS Pharmacy or the surviving corporation and
holders who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Oak Street Health common stock, the tax treatment of
a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding Oak
Street Health common stock and partners of a partnership holding Oak Street Health common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisor regarding
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger relevant to them.
This discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Holders of Oak Street Health common stock are urged to consult their
tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them in light of their particular circumstances, as well as any
tax consequences of the Merger arising under the U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, including estate or gift tax laws,
“golden parachute” rules, or under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Oak Street Health common stock that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, is:

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Oak Street Health common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and such U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share of Oak Street Health
common stock will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the closing. Long-term capital gains for
certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income taxation. Short-term capital gains
are taxed at ordinary income rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss must be calculated separately for each block of
Oak Street Health common stock (i.e., common stock acquired at the same time and at the same price in a single transaction). U.S. holders who own
separate blocks of Oak Street Health common stock should consult their own tax advisors with respect to these rules. 
A U.S. holder may, unless an exception applies, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with respect
to the cash received pursuant to the Merger, unless such U.S. holder provides its correct taxpayer identification number (referred to as the “TIN”) on IRS
Form W-9 (or if appropriate, a substitute or successor form) and certifies under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such U.S. holder is
not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to
the IRS in a timely manner and other requirements are satisfied.

Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
unless:
 
•
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States
maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a
U.S. holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or
such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, subject to certain adjustments;

•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% tax (or tax at such lower
rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on the non-U.S. holder’s net gain realized in the Merger, which may be offset
by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United
States), provided that such non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses; or

Oak Street Health is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during
the shorter of (1) the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger and (2) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period in the Oak Street Health
common stock, and, at any time during such period, the non-U.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of the
outstanding Oak Street Health common stock. Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation only if the fair market
value of its U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus
its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. Oak Street Health does not believe that it was and does not expect that it will be
a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period ending on
the date of the Merger.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with
respect to the cash received by such non-U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger, unless such non-U.S. holder provides the payment agent with an applicable
and properly executed IRS Form W-8 certifying under penalties of perjury the holder’s non-U.S. status (and the payor or applicable withholding agent
does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person as defined under the Code) or otherwise establishes an
exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange
agreement to the taxing authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, if any, provided that the non-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner and other applicable requirements are
satisfied. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.

The obligations of CVS Health and Oak Street Health to consummate the Merger are subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act. Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed
until notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the DOJ and the specified waiting period has expired or has
been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the
parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms.
Oak Street Health and CVS Health each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on
February 24, 2023. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 PM EDT on March 27, 2023. Both before and after the expiration of the
applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds.
In addition, the Merger may be reviewed by the state attorneys general in the various states in which Oak Street Health and CVS Health operate.
These authorities may claim that there is authority, under the applicable state and federal antitrust laws and regulations, to investigate and/or seek to
prohibit the Merger under the circumstances and based on the standards set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. There can be no

assurance that one or more state attorneys general will not attempt to file an antitrust action to challenge the Merger. As of the date of this proxy
statement, neither Oak Street Health nor CVS Health has been notified by any state attorney general indicating any plan to review the Merger.
There can be no assurances that all of the required regulatory approvals will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurances as to the
timing of any approvals.
The Merger Agreement includes covenants obligating each of the parties, with respect to filings under the HSR Act, to supply (or cause to be
supplied) information that may be required to make such filings or any additional information that may be requested by the FTC, DOJ, or other
governmental authorities in which such a filing is made, to cooperate and coordinate (and to cause their respective affiliates to cooperate and coordinate)
with the other to make such filings, and, subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken (including by their respective affiliates), all actions necessary, proper or advisable to (1) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act or other antitrust laws, (2) obtain all clearances, consents, approvals, waivers, actions, non-actions, or other
authorizations pursuant to any antitrust laws applicable to the Merger and (3) ensure no governmental authority enters any order, decision, judgment,
decree, ruling or injunction preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, in each case, as promptly
as practicable and in any event so as to permit consummation of the Merger prior to the Termination Date. For more information regarding these

Oak Street Health, Inc., et al., No. 23-cv-02076 (filed March 10, 2023), each name Oak Street Health and its directors as defendants and allege, among
other things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to
the Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. §
244.100. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the defendants from consummating the Merger unless and until additional
disclosures are made, and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses.
Additionally, Oak Street Health has received demand letters from purported stockholders of Oak Street Health seeking additional disclosures in the
proxy statement.
Oak Street Health cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits and demand letters. Oak Street Health believes the claims asserted in these lawsuits
and the demand letters are without merit. Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of the Merger may also be filed or received in the future. If
additional similar lawsuits and demand letters are filed or received, absent new or significantly different allegations, Oak Street Health will not necessarily

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement
and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We urge you to carefully read this entire proxy statement, including the annexes and the other
documents to which we have referred you. You should also review the section of this proxy statement titled “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.”
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide you with information regarding its terms, and we recommend that you read it in its entirety.
The Merger Agreement is a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relations among Oak Street Health, CVS Pharmacy, Merger Sub
and CVS Health and allocates risks between the parties with respect to the Merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of February 7, 2023 or
other specific dates specified in the Merger Agreement. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for
purposes of the contract between the respective parties and are subject to representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the
Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the
Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by a confidential disclosure letter
made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts), and may
be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors, security holders, or securities
laws. Investors and security holders are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger
Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after February 7, 2023, which
subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Oak Street Health’s public disclosures.
The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the description of them in this proxy statement should not be read alone but
instead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings Oak Street Health publicly files with the
SEC. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings Oak Street Health makes with the SEC, as described in the

but excluding exercise provisions) as applied to the corresponding Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and will become payable in accordance
with the original vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding Option, except that each Converted Option Cash Award will provide that the unvested
portion, if any, of such Converted Option Cash Award will immediately vest and become payable upon a termination of the holder’s employment or

Assumed RSAs and Assumed RSUs
As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 10 business days after the Effective Time, CVS Health will file a registration
statement on Form S-8 with respect to the issuance of the shares of CVS Health common stock subject to the Assumed RSAs and Assumed RSU Awards
that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8. However, in the event that the filing deadline contemplated by the prior sentence occurs while trading of
shares of CVS Health common stock has been suspended under CVS Health’s then-effective registration statements, then CVS Health will only be
required to cause the filing of the Form S-8 as soon as reasonably practicable after trading has been restored.
Procedure for Receiving Merger Consideration
Prior to the Effective Time, CVS Pharmacy agreed to select a nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Oak Street
Health to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”). At or promptly following the Effective Time, CVS Pharmacy will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to Oak Street Health
stockholders.
Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event no later than three business days thereafter), CVS Pharmacy and Oak Street Health will
direct the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of one or more certificates that represented issued
and outstanding shares of Oak Street Health common stock prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Oak Street Health common stock that are
held by Oak Street Health as treasury stock or owned by CVS Pharmacy or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), or as to which appraisal rights
have been properly exercised in accordance with Delaware law) (the “Certificates”), if any, (i) a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and
which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment
Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with the Merger Agreement)) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Oak Street Health common stock formerly represented by the
Certificates. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock represented by such Certificates by
(y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered will be cancelled. With respect to record holders of uncertificated shares of Oak Street
Health common stock (other than any shares of Oak Street Health common stock that are held by Oak Street Health as treasury stock or owned by
 
74
Table of Contents
CVS Pharmacy or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub)), upon the Payment Agent’s receipt of an “agent’s message” (or such other evidence as
the Payment Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such uncertificated shares will be entitled to receive in exchange an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock represented by such holder’s transferred
uncertificated shares by (2) the Merger Consideration, and the transferred uncertificated shares will be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrue on the cash payable to any holder of a Certificate or uncertificated share. Until so surrendered or transferred,
outstanding Certificates and uncertificated shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. 
You should not send in your Certificates until you receive a letter of transmittal with instructions from the Payment Agent. Do not send your
Certificates with your proxy card.
At or prior to the closing, CVS Pharmacy will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with Oak Street Health, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the aggregate vested equity award consideration owed to the Cash-Out Equity Award Holders. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any
event no later than ten business days after the closing date, the Cash-Out Equity Award Holders will be paid by Oak Street Health or the surviving
corporation, through its payroll system, payroll provider or Oak Street Health’s standard accounts payable procedures, as applicable, all amounts
required to be paid to such Cash-Out Equity Award Holders in respect of vested Options and RSUs that are cancelled and converted into a cash
payment, less any required withholding and other authorized deductions.
Oak Street Health will take such actions as is necessary to effect the treatment of unvested Options, RSAs, and RSUs and to effectuate the
treatment of the Oak Street Health ESPP upon the Effective Time and otherwise to give effect to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement.
Each of the surviving corporation, Merger Sub, CVS Pharmacy and the Payment Agent (each, a “Withholding Agent”) will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts payable to any person pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
under applicable law with respect to taxes; provided, that each such Withholding Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the recipient
of such payment a reasonable opportunity to provide tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8, as applicable) in order to reduce
or eliminate such withholding; provided, however, that no notice will be required for any deduction or withholding that is required for any Cash-Out
Equity Award Holders. Any amounts so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority will be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

From February 7, 2023 until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, Oak Street Health and its
subsidiaries agreed to not, and agreed to not instruct (and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause) any of their respective representatives
(in their capacities as such) not to, directly or indirectly:
 
•
solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any
proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);
 
•
furnish to any person (other than CVS Pharmacy or Merger Sub) any non-public information relating to Oak Street Health, any of its

an Acquisition Proposal);
 
•

•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than certain acceptable confidentiality agreements) (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).
 
82Table of Contents
Oak Street Health also agreed to, after February 7, 2023, instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and any of their
respective representatives (in their capacities as such) to (x) cease and terminate any discussions, communications or negotiations with any person
(other than CVS Pharmacy and its representatives) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or a proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal by such person, (y) promptly (and in any event within one business day after February 7, 2023) shut off all access
granted to any such person to any electronic data room maintained by or on behalf of Oak Street Health or its subsidiaries with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and request that all non-public information previously provided be returned or destroyed in accordance with the applicable
confidentiality agreement.
From February 7, 2023 until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, Oak Street Health will be
required to enforce, and will not be permitted to waive, terminate or modify, any provision of any existing standstill or similar provision that prohibits a
proposal being made to the Oak Street Health Board unless (A) the Oak Street Health Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (B)
Oak Street Health promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notifies CVS Pharmacy in writing of any such waiver, amendment or release.
If, at any time on or after February 7, 2023, until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and Oak Street Health’s receipt of
the Oak Street Health stockholder approval, the Oak Street Health Board receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Oak Street Health Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below), Oak
Street Health is entitled to (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, (ii) furnish any non-public information relating to Oak Street
Health or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) afford access to the business and personnel of Oak Street Health
or any of its subsidiaries, in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Oak Street Health’s no-shop
obligations under the Merger Agreement (other than a de minimis breach). Oak Street Health will provide to CVS Pharmacy any non-public information or
data that is provided to such person and was not previously made available to CVS Pharmacy substantially concurrently the time it is provided to such
person.
From and after February 7, 2023, Oak Street Health agreed to as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) notify CVS Pharmacy of
its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice must include the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal. Oak Street Health must also keep CVS Pharmacy (and its outside counsel) reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any
event, within 24 hours), of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including with respect to any change in price or other material
amendments) and any related discussions or negotiations. Oak Street Health agreed to, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within
24 hours), provide CVS Pharmacy with copies of all drafts and final versions of definitive agreements, including schedules and exhibits thereto (in each
case, or substantial and material portions thereof) relating to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case, exchanged between Oak Street Health, on the one
hand, and the person making such Acquisition Proposal, on the other hand. Oak Street Health will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, enter into
any agreement with any person subsequent to February 7, 2023 which prohibits Oak Street Health from providing any information to CVS Pharmacy.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide written offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal
by CVS Pharmacy or Merger Sub) to engage in an Acquisition Transaction. Furthermore, the term “Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or
series of related transactions (other than the Transactions) involving:
 
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of shares of more than 20% of the outstanding Oak Street Health common stock or any
other securities of the Company representing more than 20% of Oak Street Health common stock outstanding or more than 20% of the
voting power of Oak Street
 
83
Table of Contents
Health common stock outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a
tender offer or exchange offer;
 
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition of more than 20% of the consolidated assets, net revenue or net income of Oak Street
Health and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition as
determined in good faith by the Oak Street Health Board);
 
•
any merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other
transaction involving Oak Street Health or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person (other than controlled affiliates of the
Specified Stockholders that are investment funds) would hold, directly or indirectly more than 20% of the equity interests of Oak Street
Health or the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction; or
 
•
any combination of the foregoing.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will not be deemed an Acquisition
Transaction.
As used in the Merger Agreement, the term “Superior Proposal” means any Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction on terms that the
Oak Street Health Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable to
Oak Street Health stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) than the Transactions (taking into account any aspects of such proposal, including the
person making the Acquisition Proposal and all legal, regulatory and financing aspects that the Oak Street Health Board (or a committee thereof)
considers relevant). For purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition Proposal” in this definition, all references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition
Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%.”

Board may make an Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change in response to (i) a Superior Proposal, if it determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, or (ii) any change, event, effect, condition, occurrence or development (other than any change, event, effect, condition, occurrence or
development primarily resulting from the breach of the Merger Agreement by Oak Street Health) that (1) occurred or arose after February 7, 2023 that was
not known or reasonably foreseeable or the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Oak Street Health Board on
February 7, 2023 and (2) does not relate to (A) any Acquisition Proposal, (B) any change in price of Oak Street Health common stock in and of itself, or
(C) the fact, in and of itself, that Oak Street Health exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of Oak Street Health’s revenue,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period (an “Intervening Event”); provided, however, that the underlying reasons
for such changes or events described in clauses (B) and (C) may constitute an Intervening Event, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject in each case to compliance with the
procedures described below.
In the case of a Superior Proposal, no Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change and/or termination of the Merger Agreement may be made:
 
•
until after the fourth business day following written notice from Oak Street Health to CVS Pharmacy that the Oak Street Health Board
intends to effect an Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal, the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and copies of all definitive agreements relating to such Superior Proposal (with any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal requiring a new notice of superior proposal with a new notice period
of two business days); and
 
•
unless during such four business day period (or two business day period following an amended proposal), Oak Street Health agreed to
negotiate with CVS Pharmacy in good faith (to the extent that CVS Pharmacy desires to so negotiate) to enable CVS Pharmacy to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect an Oak Street
Health Board Recommendation Change or termination, following which the Oak Street Health Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that even after giving effect to such adjustments proposed by CVS
Pharmacy, such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to either (x) effect an Oak Street Health Board
Recommendation Change in connection therewith or (y) terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into such Acquisition Proposal would
continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Oak Street Health Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law.
In the case of an Intervening Event, no adverse recommendation change may be made:
 
•
until after the fourth business day following written notice from Oak Street Health to CVS Pharmacy that the Oak Street Health Board
intends to effect an Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event, which notice will specify the
basis for such change in the Oak Street Health Board Recommendation, including all material information available to Oak Street Health with
respect to such Intervening Event; and
 
•
unless during such four business day period, Oak Street Health agreed to negotiate with CVS Pharmacy in good faith (to the extent that CVS
Pharmacy desires to so negotiate) to enable CVS Pharmacy to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect such Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change, following which the Oak
Street Health Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel), that even after giving effect to such
adjustments proposed by CVS Pharmacy, the failure to effect an Oak Street Health Board Recommendation Change would continue to be

business that would be commensurate in magnitude to an Oak Street Health Material Adverse Effect.

between Oak Street Health or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and
any person who becomes a director or officer of Oak Street Health or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (each an
“Indemnified Person” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving

89Table of Contents
documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses provisions set forth in the organizational
documents as of February 7, 2023, which provisions will not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any adverse manner except as required by
applicable law.
For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will, and CVS Pharmacy will cause the surviving corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever
asserted, to the extent that such legal proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to the fact that an Indemnified
Person is or was a director or officer of Oak Street Health or any of its subsidiaries; any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such
Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director or officer of Oak Street Health or any of its subsidiaries, or taken at the request of Oak Street Health or such

If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to CVS Pharmacy a written notice asserting a
claim for indemnification, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such legal proceeding, the surviving corporation will (and CVS Pharmacy will cause the surviving corporation to) advance
all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such legal proceeding;
provided, that any person to whom fees and expenses are advanced will be obligated to return the advanced fees and expenses if it is determined that
such person is not entitled to indemnification. None of CVS Pharmacy, the surviving corporation nor any of their respective affiliates will settle or

indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release
of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of or relating to such legal proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to
whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by
the surviving corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the
surviving corporation.

respect than those of Oak Street Health’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, that in no event will the surviving corporation be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by Oak Street Health
for coverage for its last full fiscal year, which amount is referred to as the “maximum annual premium.” If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the maximum annual premium, then CVS Pharmacy and the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the maximum annual premium from an insurance carrier. In satisfaction of the foregoing obligations, prior to the
Effective Time, Oak Street Health may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to Oak Street Health’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Oak Street Health’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so

For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, CVS Pharmacy agreed to provide each employee of Oak Street Health or its subsidiaries who
is employed by Oak Street Health or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues employment with CVS Pharmacy or any
subsidiary of CVS Pharmacy (including the surviving corporation) immediately following the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) with (1) base
salary or wage rate, target cash incentive opportunities (including bonus and commission, but excluding retention, change in control or transaction
compensation) and target equity or equity-based incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those in effect for such Continuing
Employee immediately before the Effective Time; (2) severance and termination benefits that are no less favorable than those applicable to such
Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time; and (3) all other employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those in
effect for (or available to) such Continuing Employee under Oak Street Health’s employee plans as of the Effective Time or that are provided by CVS
Pharmacy to similarly-situated employees of CVS Pharmacy (excluding any defined benefit pension plan benefits).
With respect to each of Oak Street Health’s annual cash incentive plans (each, an “Oak Street Health Incentive Plan”), for the fiscal year in which
the Effective Time occurs, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and CVS Pharmacy will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries
to) pay to each Continuing Employee who remains employed with CVS Pharmacy, the surviving corporation or their respective affiliates through the end
of such fiscal year, at the same time or times that CVS Pharmacy, the surviving corporation or their applicable affiliate pays annual bonuses in respect of
such fiscal year to other similarly situated employees thereof but in no event later than March 15 immediately after the end of such fiscal year, a bonus for
such fiscal year (the “Annual Bonus”) that is equal to the greater of (i) the target Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee would have been
entitled to receive under the applicable Oak Street Health Incentive Plan for such fiscal year, and (ii) the Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee is
entitled to receive under the applicable Oak Street Health Incentive Plan based on actual level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria for
such fiscal year (as determined after giving appropriate effect to the Merger). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing and unless
otherwise provided in an applicable employee plan, if a Continuing Employee’s employment is terminated without “cause” or due to a resignation by the
Continuing Employee for “good reason” before payment of the Annual Bonus (a “Qualifying Termination”), the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries will (and CVS Pharmacy will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) pay to such Continuing Employee, no later than 30 days
following the date of such Qualifying Termination, subject to such Continuing Employee executing and not revoking a general release of claims in a
customary form in favor of the surviving corporation, CVS Pharmacy and each of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, a pro-rated portion of the
target Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive under the applicable Oak Street Health Incentive Plan for such
fiscal year if such Continuing Employee had remained employed, with such proration based on the relative portion of the fiscal year during which such
Continuing Employee was employed with the Company, CVS Pharmacy, the surviving corporation or any of their respective affiliates.
With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement that is made available to any Continuing Employee
at or after the Effective Time (each such plans, a “New Plan”), the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and CVS Pharmacy will cause the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with Oak Street Health and its
subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for which credit was provided by the Company prior to the

Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits, vacation and other time off accrual, equity or equity-based
incentive compensation and severance entitlement or terminations pay, except to the extent that such credit would result in duplication of benefits or the
funding thereof for the same period of service. In addition, (i) the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces the Continuing Employee’s coverage pursuant to a corresponding employee plan (each such plan, an
“Old Plan”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing health and welfare benefits, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents; (iii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
health and welfare benefits, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize or credit, in the manner
determined by CVS Pharmacy in its discretion, any eligible expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the corresponding Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing Employees’ participation in the corresponding New Plan begin;
and (iv) the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to credit the accounts of the Continuing Employees
pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending account plan with any unused balances in the account of such Continuing Employees under the Old
Plan that is a flexible spending account plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time.

Street Health 401(k) Plan effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, pursuant to a duly adopted resolution of the Oak Street
Health or its applicable affiliate (the form and substance of which will be subject to review and approval by CVS Pharmacy, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than seven days prior to the Effective Time. If the Oak Street Health 401(k) Plan is terminated in
accordance with the prior sentence, CVS Pharmacy will or will cause its applicable affiliate to permit each Continuing Employee who participated in the

CVS Pharmacy or its applicable affiliate (the “CVS Pharmacy 401(k) Plan”), effective as soon as possible after the Effective Time, but in no case later than
the first day of the month following the Effective Time, and (ii) make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including loans) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof, in an amount equal to the
account balance distributed or distributable to such Continuing Employee from the Oak Street Health 401(k) Plan to the CVS Pharmacy 401(k) Plan,
provided that all such rollovers are in a single plan-to-plan transfer (to the extent the recordkeeper of the Oak Street Health 401(k) Plan can accommodate

provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting thereof, or to dispose or
direct the disposition thereof or has the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. Shares of Oak Street Health common stock subject to Options that
are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of March 3, 2023 and/or shares underlying RSUs that are scheduled to vest within 60 days of
March 3, 2023 are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the Options and/or RSUs. These shares, however, are not
deemed outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as disclosed in the footnotes to this table and
subject to applicable community property laws, we believe that each stockholder identified in the table possesses sole voting and investment power over
all shares of Oak Street Health common stock shown as beneficially owned by the stockholder.

General
If the Merger is consummated, shares of Oak Street Health common stock held by Oak Street Health stockholders who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold their shares of Oak Street Health common stock through the effective time of the Merger, who
properly demand appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock (and who do not withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights), and who
otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but Oak Street
Health stockholders will be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
The following summarizes Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. The following discussion is not a complete
statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Delaware law and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is
accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The
following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that you exercise your appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, which are
accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262,
particularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for
demanding and perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in this summary to (i) a “stockholder” are to the record
holder of shares of Oak Street Health common stock, (ii) a “beneficial owner” are to a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health
common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and (iii) a “person” are to an individual, corporation, partnership,
unincorporated association or other entity. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders desiring to exercise their right to appraisal must (1) properly
submit a written demand for an appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock to Oak Street Health prior to the stockholder vote on the
Merger Proposal; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the Merger Proposal; (3) hold shares of Oak Street Health common stock upon the
making of a demand under clause (1) and continue to hold their shares of Oak Street Health common stock through the effective date of the Merger; (4)
not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case,
in accordance with the DGCL; and (5) otherwise meet the criteria and follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares in accordance with the procedures
of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the DGCL summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the
effective date of the Merger and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262
of the DGCL, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is
accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a
true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Oak Street
Health under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the Verified List (defined below). The shares of Oak Street Health common stock are currently
listed on a national securities exchange, and, assuming such shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which
we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Oak Street
Health stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock entitled to
appraisal exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health common stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the value of the aggregate
consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement in respect of such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000. We refer to these conditions as
the “Minimum Conditions.”
 
103Table of Contents
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment;
provided, however, that at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation may
pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount
that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair
value of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less
than the Merger Consideration.  
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for approval and adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of the corporation’s stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of
such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section
262 of the DGCL or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed
without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes such notice that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full
text of Section 262 of the DGCL is accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the Merger, any person who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who
wishes to preserve such person’s right to do so should review the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL carefully. Failure to comply with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses
his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal, we believe that if a person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel. 
Stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock must
strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner or the surviving corporation must file a petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The
surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
Because receipt of a signed proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, a
stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the Merger
Proposal, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank, broker or other nominee regarding methods of
voting.
Filing Written Demand
Any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Oak Street Health, before the vote on the Merger Proposal
at the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person’s shares. Neither voting against the Merger Proposal nor abstaining from
voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262
of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal. A stockholder’s or
beneficial owner’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will constitute a
waiver of appraisal rights.

Table of Contents
Record Holders
A demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform us of the identity
of the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If a holder of
record is submitting a demand with respect to shares owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one
person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including
an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify
the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of
record, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of Oak Street Health common stock as nominee or intermediary for one or
more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of Oak Street Health common stock held for one or more beneficial owners
while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Oak Street Health
common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will
be presumed to cover all shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in the name of the holder of record.
Beneficial Owners
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares in accordance with the procedures
of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the DGCL summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the
effective date of the Merger and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262
of the DGCL, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is
accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a
true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Oak Street
Health under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the Verified List (defined below).
Although not expressly required by Section 262 of the DGCL, Oak Street Health reserves the right to take the position that it may require the
submission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any person sharing
beneficial ownership of the shares for which such demand is submitted.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to:
Oak Street Health, Inc.
30 W. Monroe St, Suite 1200, Chicago, IL 60603
Attention: Chief Legal Officer and Secretary
Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by electronic transmission.
Actions After Completion of the Merger
If the Merger is completed, within ten days after the effective date of the Merger, the surviving corporation will notify each Oak Street Health
stockholder who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal,
and any beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal, of the effective date of the Merger. At any time within 60 days after the effective date of
the Merger, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal
 
105
Table of Contents
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration offered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Oak Street Health a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Within 120 days after the effective
date of the Merger, the surviving corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the
surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the fair value of the
shares held by all of Oak Street Health stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention,
to file a petition, and no person should assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value
of the shares of Oak Street Health common stock. Accordingly, any Oak Street Health stockholder or beneficial owner who desire to have their shares of
Oak Street Health common stock appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Oak Street
Health common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of shares
of Oak Street Health common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL could result in the loss of appraisal
rights.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be
entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of
the Merger Proposal and with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners
holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the record holder of such shares
shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The surviving corporation must give this
statement to the requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after
the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of Oak Street Health common stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is
served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware
Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “Verified List”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded
appraisal for their shares of Oak Street Health common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Oak Street Health common
stock have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for
the hearing on the petition be mailed to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the Verified List at the addresses stated therein.
The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs of these notices shall be borne
by the surviving corporation.
After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to
determine those persons who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock to submit their stock certificates
to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that
direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
In addition, assuming Oak Street Health common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all Oak Street Health stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless one of the
Minimum Conditions is met.

Table of Contents
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of Oak Street
Health common stock subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments
made by the surviving corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL that have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest
accrues as described above).
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered,
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.”
The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends,
earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future
prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock as so determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, “fair
value” under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal
of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering exercising appraisal rights should recognize that such an
appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration.
Neither Oak Street Health nor CVS Pharmacy anticipates offering more than the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any
holder of shares of Oak Street Health common stock exercising appraisal rights, and Oak Street Health and CVS Pharmacy each reserve the right to make a
voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section
262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of Oak Street Health common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a demand for appraisal is duly
withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or other requirements imposed by Section 262 of the DGCL to perfect and seek appraisal are not
satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will cease.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name
appears on the Verified List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL.
 
107
Table of Contents
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to
the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order.
The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of
a person whose name appears on the Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL
or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL. In the absence of such an order,
each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Oak Street Health common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or
loses or successfully withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of Oak Street Health common stock will be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or
withdraw, such person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger or if the person delivers
to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the person’s demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
From and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares of Oak Street
Health common stock will be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares,
except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if
the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in respect of
some or all of such person’s shares within 60 days after the Effective Time in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or, with respect to Oak Street
Health stockholders, if neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Oak Street Health common stock remained listed on a national securities
exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time), then the right of such person to an appraisal of such shares shall cease. Once a petition for appraisal is
filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, no appraisal proceeding shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without limitation, a
reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection (j) of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided that
this sentence does not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger.
Failure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Oak Street Health stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to
consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

If the Merger is completed, we will become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Health and will no longer have public stockholders, and
following the Effective Time, you will no longer be entitled to attend and participate in any future annual meetings of our stockholders. However, if the
Merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to notice of, and may attend and participate in, Oak Street Health’s annual meetings of

(a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to read as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation (subject to Section 6.9(a)).
(b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation, except that all references to Merger Sub shall be automatically amended and shall become references to the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation and such bylaws (subject to Section 6.9(a)).
2.6 Directors and Officers. The Parties shall take all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, in each case, until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal, in each case as provided in the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation and by applicable Law.
2.7 Effect on Capital Stock.
(a) Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the securities described in this Section 2.7, the following
will occur:
(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation;
(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Owned Company Shares, shares subject to outstanding awards of Company Restricted Stock or Dissenting Company Shares) will be automatically
cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $39.00 per share, without interest thereon (the “Per Share
Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond,
if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11); and
(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock or (B) owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Owned Company Shares”) will
automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.
(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if required by the DGCL (but only
to the extent required thereby), Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Owned
Company Shares) and that is held by holders of such Company Common Stock who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance
 
17
Table of Contents
with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such Company Common Stock held by any such holder (the “Dissenting
Company Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7, and holders of such Dissenting
Company Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.
If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Company Shares will thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable for payment of the Per Share Price for such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Company Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in
the previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company
Common Stock and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands. Parent
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
compromise, or settle or compromise, any such demands. For purposes of this Section 2.7(c), “participate” means that Parent will be kept reasonably
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting
Company Shares, and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands, which comments or suggestions the Company shall
consider in good faith, but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment, settlement or
compromise consent set forth above.
2.8 Equity Awards and Company ESPP.
(a) Company Options.
(i) Except as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised
Company Option that is vested or that, pursuant to its terms as in effect as of the date hereof, would become vested as of the Effective Time (with any
performance conditions applicable to such Company Options determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement relating thereto as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time), and has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time less than the Per Share Price, will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess of
the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the “Cash-Out Option Consideration”).
(ii) Except as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.8(a)(i) and has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time less than the Per Share Price shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the contractual right to receive a payment in an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable
withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) the excess of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (each, a “Converted Option Cash
Award”). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8(a)(ii), each Converted Option Cash Award will be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including applicable vesting provisions, but excluding exercise provisions) as applied to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and will become payable to the holder thereof in accordance with the original vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding Company
Option; provided, that each Converted Option Cash Award shall

provide that the unvested portion, if any, of such Converted Option Cash Award will immediately vest and become payable upon a termination of the
holder’s employment or services by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries without “Cause” or a resignation by the holder for “Good
Reason” (each as defined in Section 6.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter) that occurs within the twelve (12) month period following the Effective
Time. The transactions contemplated by this Section 2.8(a)(ii) shall in all cases be effected in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(iii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Option (whether vested or unvested) that has an exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time that is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Price, will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled for no consideration.
(b) Company Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an Ultimate Parent
restricted stock award (each, an “Assumed Restricted Stock Award”) on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting and expiration
provisions) as applied to each such award of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed Restricted
Stock Award shall cover that number of whole shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such award of Company Restricted Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock, and such Assumed Restricted
Stock Award shall provide that the unvested portion, if any, of such Assumed Restricted Stock Award will immediately vest upon a termination of the
holder’s employment or services by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries without “Cause” or a resignation by the holder for “Good
Reason” (each as defined in Section 6.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter) that occurs within the twelve (12) month period following the Effective
Time.
(c) Company RSUs. 
(i) Except as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time each award of Company RSUs that (A) is
vested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) pursuant to its terms as in effect as of the date hereof, would become vested
as of the Effective Time (in each case, with any performance conditions applicable to such award of Company RSUs determined in accordance with the
applicable award agreement relating thereto as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding Taxes,
equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Price and (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award of Company RSUs as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cash-Out RSU Consideration,” and together with the Cash-Out Option Consideration, the “Cash-Out
Equity Award Consideration”).
(ii) Except as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs that (A)
was granted prior to the date hereof and (B) is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the contractual right to receive a payment in an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Price and (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such award of Company RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Converted RSU Cash Award”). Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 2.8(c)(ii), each Converted RSU Cash Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including time-based vesting
conditions) as applied to the corresponding award of Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time and will become payable to the holder
thereof in accordance with the original vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding Company RSU; provided, that each Converted RSU Cash Award

upon a termination of the holder’s employment or services by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries without “Cause” or a resignation by
the holder for “Good Reason” (each as defined in Section 6.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter) that occurs within the twelve (12) month period
following the Effective Time.
(iii) At the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs that is (A) granted on or after the date hereof (to the extent expressly
permitted pursuant to Section 5.2(g)) and (B) outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action
on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an Ultimate Parent restricted stock unit award (each, an “Assumed RSU
Award”) on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting and expiration provisions) as applied to each such award of Company RSUs
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed RSU Award shall cover that number of whole shares of Ultimate Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such award of Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Ultimate Parent
Common Stock.
(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days following the
Effective Time), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the issuance of the shares of Ultimate Parent
Common Stock subject to the Assumed Restricted Stock Awards and Assumed RSU Awards that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8 and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Assumed Restricted Stock Awards and Assumed RSU Awards remain outstanding;
provided, however, that in the event that the filing deadline contemplated by this Section 2.8(d) shall occur while trading of shares of Ultimate Parent
Common Stock has been suspended under Ultimate Parent’s then-effective registration statements, then Parent shall only be required to cause the filing
of the Form S-8 as soon as reasonably practicable after trading has been restored.
(e) Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP to (i) provide that (A) the
commencement of any future offering period will be suspended following the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP unless and until this
Agreement is terminated, (B) there will be no increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the Company ESPP during the

commence participation in the Company ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, and (E) each purchase right
issued pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be fully exercised on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such offering period and (y) the date
that is no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time (with any participant payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of shares of
Company Common Stock returned to the participant), and (ii) terminate the Company ESPP effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(f) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate Cash-Out Equity Award Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options and Company RSUs pursuant
to Section 2.8(a)(i) and Section 2.8(c)(i), respectively (collectively, the “Cash-Out Equity Award Holders”). As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in
any event no later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Closing Date, the Cash-Out Equity Award Holders will be paid by the Surviving Corporation,
through its payroll system, payroll provider or the Company’s standard accounts payable procedures, as applicable, all amounts required to be paid to
such holders in respect of Company Options and Company RSUs that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) and Section 2.8(c)(i),

(g) Further Actions. The Company shall take such action as is necessary to effect the treatment of Company Options, Company Restricted
Stock and Company RSUs under this Section 2.8.
2.9 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) select a nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Payment Fund. On the Closing Date, at or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7,
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 (the
“Payment Fund”). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as
directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality
by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s
acceptances of commercial banks. To the extent that: (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund; (B) the Payment
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all
or any portion of the Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated
by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment
Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to
make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation as Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment to holders of Company Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 2.7.
(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall direct the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of one or more certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares, as applicable) (the “Certificates”), if any, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.11)), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Price
payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share Price, and the Certificates so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter
of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7 in respect of such
Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, such record holder of Uncertificated Shares, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request), will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal
to the product
 
21
Table of Contents
obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares
by (2) the Per Share Price, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and transfer of such Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and
the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that the Payment Agent shall transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount
in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person
requesting such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer reasonably acceptable to the Payment
Agent and the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
(f) No Liability. Subject to applicable Law, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to
a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.
(g) Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or
transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall
thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), as general creditors
thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares five (5) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.
2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

Table of Contents
2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in
exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof reasonably acceptable to the Payment Agent and the Surviving
Corporation, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
2.12 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (each, a “Withholding
Agent”) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom pursuant to any Law in respect of Taxes; provided, that each such Withholding Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the recipient of such payment a reasonable opportunity to provide tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8, as
applicable) in order to reduce or eliminate such withholding; provided, however, that no notice shall be required for any deduction or withholding that is
required for any Cash-Out Equity Award Consideration. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid in satisfaction of the corresponding obligations hereunder.

the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of

controlled Affiliates of Ultimate Parent, threatened against Parent, Ultimate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, other than any
such Legal Proceeding that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger by Parent or Merger Sub, and none of Parent, Ultimate Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates is a party to or subject to the

future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III, Parent and

expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith), be Solvent at the Effective Time. As used in this
Section 4.8, the term “Solvent” means, as of the Effective Time, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis) will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis) has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (c) each of Parent
and Merger Sub (and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis) does not have unreasonably small capital with which to
conduct its business.

(equity or otherwise) is required by any Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of Parent or Ultimate
Parent or the applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent or Ultimate Parent are traded, in order for Parent or Ultimate Parent to

share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger, and, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not have engaged in any other business activities and shall not have incurred liabilities or obligations other than as

has furnished to the Company correct and complete copies thereof), if any, between or among Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent, on the one
hand, and any member of the Company Board or officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

representations or warranties whatsoever in connection with the Transactions, express or implied, except as set forth in Article III (or in the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(d)). The Company has made available to Parent and Merger Sub, and may continue to make available, certain estimates,
projections and other forecasts for the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain plan and budget information. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges that these estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets and the assumptions on which they are based were prepared for
specific purposes and may vary significantly from each other. Further, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets), and that, except as set forth in Article III (or in
the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(d)), none of Parent or Merger Sub is relying on any estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets
furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates and Representatives, and none of Parent or Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives not to, hold any such Person liable with respect thereto.
4.16 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by Parent, Ultimate Parent and Merger
Sub in this Article IV or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, none of Parent, Ultimate Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person makes or
has made or is making any representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at Law or in equity, with respect to Parent, Ultimate

pursuant to this Agreement, Parent, Ultimate Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
other Person, makes or has made or is making any other representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at Law or in equity, with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates or their respective business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or

request that all non-public information previously provided be returned or destroyed in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement. From
the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will
be required to enforce, and will not be permitted to waive, terminate or modify, any provision of any existing standstill (or similar provision that prohibits
or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof)), unless (A) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notifies
Parent in writing of any such waiver, amendment or release.
(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the

Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement, contact such Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and otherwise facilitate such
Acquisition Proposal or assist such Person (and such Person’s Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal if requested by
such Person, in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 5.3(a) or this Section 5.3(b) (other than a de
minimis breach), the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Subject to applicable Law and any applicable “clean team” or similar
arrangement, the Company shall provide to Parent any non-public information or data that is provided to any Person given such access that was not
previously made available to Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person.
(c) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company’s receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval:
(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to be
 
50
Table of Contents
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not effect such a Company
Board Recommendation Change unless:
(A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance to the effect that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, which notice
shall specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change, including all material information available to the Company with respect to
such Intervening Event; and
(B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, (1) the Company
and its Representatives, during such four (4) Business Day period, have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that
Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would
obviate the need to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change and (2) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any proposal
by Parent to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel), that even after giving effect to such adjustments proposed by Parent, the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or
(ii) if the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) (other
than a de minimis breach) that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not take any action described in the
foregoing clauses (x) and (y) unless:
(A) (1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance (such notice
period, including any extension thereto in accordance with this Section 5.3(c)(ii)(A), the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) intends to take the actions described in subclauses (x) or (y) of Section 5.3(c)(ii), including the identity of the Person or Group making
such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all definitive agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (2) prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (x) the Company and its
Representatives, during the Notice Period, have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so
negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or termination with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (y) the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any proposal by Parent to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that even after giving effect to such adjustments proposed by Parent such
Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to either (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in connection
therewith or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into such Acquisition Proposal would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that in the event of any material revision, modification or amendment to such
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), the Company
will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(c)(ii)(A) with respect to such new written
notice, it being understood that the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be extended for an additional two (2) Business Days after
notification of such change.
(d) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as permitted by Section
5.3(c), the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not:

14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act by the close of business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal, (C) adopt, endorse, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, endorse, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or submit to the Company Stockholders for approval or adoption, any Acquisition Proposal; or (D) fail to publicly reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of receiving a written request from Parent to provide such public reaffirmation following
receipt by the Company of a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal (provided, that Parent may deliver only one (1) such request with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal) (any action described in clauses (A)-(D) (or, in respect of an Intervening Event, described in clause (A) only), a “Company Board
Recommendation Change”); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the factually accurate disclosure by the Company to Parent of the
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of an Intervening Event, (2) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that
an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or that an Intervening Event has occurred; (3) the public disclosure by the Company of (x) the
Intervening Event or (y) its determination that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, in each case, so long as such disclosure also
states that no Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement shall occur until the expiration of the applicable notice period
contemplated by Section 5.3(c) has occurred and promptly after the end of such notice period the Company shall either (x) issue a public press release
stating that the prior Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal or that there is no longer an Intervening Event or (y) make a
Company Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), or (4) the delivery by the Company of any notice
contemplated by Section 5.3(c) will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(e) Notice. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII
and the Effective Time, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in
writing if any Acquisition Proposal or any proposals or offers that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition
Proposal or such proposal or offer, and (ii) a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal or any such proposal or offer made in writing that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal offer or proposal (or, if made orally, a reasonably detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal, proposal or offer).
Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent (and its outside counsel) reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours), of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including with respect to any change in price or other material amendments)
and the status of any related discussions or negotiations. The Company will, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours), provide Parent with copies of all drafts and final versions of definitive agreements, including schedules and exhibits thereto (in each
case, or substantial and material portions thereof) (which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal), relating to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case, exchanged between the Company or any of its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the other hand. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.3(e).
(f) Certain Disclosures. Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position

contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), making a customary “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) or from making disclosures
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to applicable securities Laws with regard to the Transactions or an Acquisition Proposal and a disclosure that
constitutes only a “stop-look-and-listen” statement (or any similar communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) permitted by
this Section 5.3(f) shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change.
5.4 No Control of the Other Party’s Business. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended
to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or

consummation of the Merger as soon as practicable and, in any event, to permit such consummation of the Merger prior to the Termination Date;
provided, that Parent, Ultimate Parent and Merger Sub need not nor shall otherwise be required to take any action, including any Remedial Action that,
individually or in the aggregate, together with one or more other Remedial Actions, would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition.

Action, that is not conditioned on the Closing.

cause their respective Affiliates to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Laws, (i) promptly notify the other Parties of, and, if in writing, furnish the
others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any material communication received by such Person
from a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and provide the other Parties a reasonable amount of time to review and discuss in
advance (and consider in good faith any comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal notifications, filing,
submission or other written or oral communication (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other data,
information, materials or documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a Governmental Authority by any such Person, except
for the Parties’ HSR filings, (ii) keep the other Parties informed with respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental

(d) Other Actions. Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Parent, Ultimate Parent and the Company shall not (and each shall
cause its Affiliates not to) take any action, or refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would be to materially delay or materially impede the
ability of the Parties to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Ultimate Parent and the Company shall not

business as the Company or its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent or Ultimate Parent) or any assets in the same line of business as Parent or Ultimate
Parent (in the case of the Company) if the entering into an agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Permit, order, ruling,
judgment or injunction or other approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority asserting jurisdiction over the Transactions entering an
order, ruling, judgment or injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order, ruling, judgment or injunction on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of this Section 6.2, the Company shall use its best efforts to take the actions set forth on Section 6.2(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
(b) Other Required Company Filing. If the Company is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in

Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NYSE.

56
Table of Contents
relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing,
so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company
Stockholders.
(d) Consultation Prior to Certain Communications. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing
with the SEC without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and the Company shall consider in good
faith all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other Parties or their respective counsel. The Company and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, shall not send a substantive, written communication to the SEC
or its staff with respect to the contents of the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, without providing the other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written communication and each Party shall consider in good faith all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other Parties or their respective counsel.
(e) Notices. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall advise the other, promptly after it receives

to the Proxy Statement.
(f) Dissemination of Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC, and in
any event within three (3) Business Days following confirmation by the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy
Statement, which confirmation will be deemed to have occurred if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company by 11:59 p.m., New York City time,
on the tenth (10th) day after filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement.
6.4 Company Stockholder Meeting.
(a) Call of Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the Company Stockholders (the “Company Stockholder Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, but subject to
Section 6.4(b), to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting within thirty-five (35) days) following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company
Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall conduct in a timely
manner a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act and establish a record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting in a
manner to enable the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting to be set so that such Company Stockholder Meeting will be duly called and held
within the time period set forth in the foregoing sentence. Unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.3(c),
the Company Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from Company Stockholders proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The
 
57
Table of Contents
Company shall keep Parent informed with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent and shall provide such information and
reasonable cooperation as Parent may reasonably request in connection therewith.
(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the
Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting: (i) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval; (ii) if there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting; (iii) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (iv) in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time
to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company
Stockholders (including in connection with any Company Board Recommendation Change); provided, however, that in the case of the foregoing clauses
(i) or (ii), in no event shall the Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned by the Company more than twice or for more than twenty (20)
Business Days, in the aggregate, with such postponement or adjournment at the request of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.4(b), beyond the originally
scheduled date of the Company Stockholder Meeting without Parent’s written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If, at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, a quorum has not been established or the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock for the Requisite Stockholder Approval, then the Company shall, at the written request of Parent
(to the extent permitted by Law), adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to a date specified by Parent; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned at the request of Parent more than twice or for more than twenty (20) Business Days, in the
aggregate, without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
6.5 Indebtedness . At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall provide to the Company funds in an amount equal to the amount
necessary for the Company to) repay and discharge in full all Payoff Debt. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date one or more fully executed copies of customary pay-off letters (each, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent) certifying that upon payoff (i) the Company Indebtedness and any indebtedness (including any accrued and unpaid interest)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 5.2(f) and identified in writing by Parent to the Company at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (such indebtedness, together with the Company Indebtedness, the “Payoff Debt”) has been discharged and paid
in full and that all commitments and obligations thereunder have been terminated in full (other than indemnities and other contingent obligations
expressly meant to survive termination), (ii) releasing any and all related Liens on any of the assets or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries
securing such Payoff Debt and (iii) authorizing the filing of UCC-3 termination statements (or other comparable documents) for all UCC-1 financing
statements (or other comparable documents) filed in connection with any such Lien and other customary filings, releases, terminations or instruments of
discharge, in each case effective upon the receipt of funds by the applicable agents, trustees, holders and lenders party to any of the agreements
governing such Payoff Debt, and (b) give (by no later than the date required under the applicable agreements governing such Payoff Debt) any
necessary notices (including notices of prepayment and/or notice of commitment termination) to allow for the prepayment, payoff, discharge and
termination in full of all commitments, obligations, debts and other liabilities under or with respect to such Payoff Debt on the Closing Date (other than
indemnities and other contingent obligations expressly meant to survive termination).
6.6 Anti-Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take all reasonable actions within their power to ensure that no “anti-
takeover” statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transactions or the Voting Agreements; and (b) if any “anti-takeover”
statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Transactions or the Voting Agreements, take all reasonable actions within their power to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms
 
58
Table of Contents
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions or the Voting Agreements.
6.7 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company shall, solely for purposes of furthering the Merger or
integration planning related thereto subject to the restrictions or limitations as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance request, to the properties,
books, records, Contracts and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and instruct its and their Representatives and personnel to reasonably
cooperate with Parent, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (i) any
applicable Law or Contract requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information or providing access to such
documents or information would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to,
such Contract; (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to the waiver of any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
privilege applicable to such documents or information; (iii) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets (including source code) of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any third Persons; or (iv) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding
between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand (provided, that the foregoing clause shall not
restrict any Person’s rights to seek discovery pursuant to Law, and nothing herein shall restrict any Person’s rights to oppose any discovery request
pursuant to Law); provided, that the Company shall give written notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents
pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv) and thereafter the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the disclosure of such information (or as
much of it as possible) in a manner that would not violate any of clauses (i) through (iv). Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.7 shall be conducted in a manner that does not (i) unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and
timely discharge by officers, employees and other authorized Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their normal duties or (ii)
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to operate any
equipment or perform invasive or subsurface testing or any sampling, monitoring or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials, indoor air, or other
environmental media. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives
not to, contact any employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not involved in the negotiation or consummation of the
Transactions or any customer, technology or other partner, vendor or supplier of the Company in connection with the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, in each case, without the Company’s prior written consent, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that any such contact shall
be arranged and supervised by Representatives of the Company. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.7 must be directed to the Chief Legal
Officer of the Company or other Person designated by the Company.
6.8 Section 16(b) Exemption. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) (including the disposition,
cancellation, or deemed disposition and cancellation of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs) in
connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company, to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

59
Table of Contents
(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any Person who becomes
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (each, an “Indemnified Person” and,
collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six (6) year period, such provisions may not
be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any adverse manner except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.9(a), during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees
and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whenever asserted, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, out of (i) the fact that an
Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such
Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director or officer, trustee or fiduciary of another
Person (including any employee benefit plan), regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after
the Effective Time); and (iii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto, except that if, at any
time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.9(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until
such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) advance all fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified
Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding; provided, that any Person to whom fees and expenses are advanced shall be obligated to return the
advanced fees and expenses if it is determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of or relating to such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct
of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
and similar insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms
 
60
Table of Contents
(including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are no less favorable in any material respect than those of the D&O
Insurance in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.9(c), the Surviving Corporation will
not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300%
amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. In
satisfaction of the foregoing obligations, prior to the Effective Time the Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance
from an insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to
purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
such “tail” policy in full force and effect for a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder
in lieu of the maintenance of the D&O Insurance.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
Section 6.9.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.9 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in
Section 6.9(c) (and their heirs and representatives), the “Other Indemnified Persons”) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified
Person or other Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or Other Indemnified Persons are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, with
full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons and Other Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Section 6.9 will be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the Organizational
Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and
officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.
6.10 Employee Matters.
(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change of control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of
the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.
(b) Existing Arrangements. Subject to this Section 6.10, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Employee Plans set forth on Sections 3.18(a) and 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Employment; Benefits. For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
 
61
Table of Contents
Subsidiaries to) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee (i) base salary or wage rate, target cash incentive opportunities (including bonus
and commission, but excluding retention, change in control or transaction compensation) and target equity or equity-based incentive opportunities that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time; (ii) severance and
termination benefits that are no less favorable than those applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and which
severance and termination benefits are set forth in Section 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (iii) all other employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to those in effect for (or available to) such Continuing Employee under the Employee Plans as of the Effective Time or that are
provided by Parent to similarly-situated employees of Parent (excluding any defined benefit pension plan benefits).
(d) Company Incentive Plans. With respect to each of the Company’s annual cash incentive plans set forth in Section 6.10(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (each, a “Company Incentive Plan”), for the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) pay to each Continuing Employee who remains employed
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates through the end of such fiscal year, at the same time or times that Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their applicable Affiliate pays annual bonuses in respect of such fiscal year to other similarly situated employees thereof, but in
no event later than March 15 immediately after the end of such fiscal year, a bonus for such fiscal year (the “Annual Bonus”) that is equal to the greater
of (i) the target Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive under the applicable Company Incentive Plan for such
fiscal year, and (ii) the Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee is entitled to receive under the applicable Company Incentive Plan based on actual
level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria for such fiscal year (as determined after giving appropriate effect to the Transactions).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing and unless otherwise provided in an applicable Employee Plan, if a Continuing Employee’s
employment is terminated without “Cause” or due to the Continuing Employee’s resignation with “Good Reason” (each as defined in Section 6.10(d) of
the Company Disclosure Letter) before payment of the Annual Bonus (a “Qualifying Termination”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) pay to such Continuing Employee, no later than thirty (30) days following the
date of such Qualifying Termination, subject to such Continuing Employee executing and not revoking a general release of claims in a customary form in
favor of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, a pro-rated portion of the target Annual Bonus that
such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive under the applicable Company Incentive Plan for such fiscal year if such Continuing
Employee had remained employed, with such proration based on the relative portion of the fiscal year during which such Continuing Employee was
employed with the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.
(e) New Plans. With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement that is made available to any
Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each such plan, a “New Plan”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for which credit was provided by the Company prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, entitlement to benefits, vacation and other time off accrual, equity or equity-based incentive compensation and severance entitlement or
termination pay, except to the extent that such credit would result in duplication of benefits or the funding thereof for the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces the Continuing Employee’s coverage pursuant to a corresponding Employee Plan (each such plan, an
“Old Plan”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing health and welfare benefits, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
 
62
Table of Contents
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents; (iii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing health and welfare benefits, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
recognize or credit, in the manner determined by Parent in its discretion, any eligible expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the corresponding Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing Employees’ participation in the New
Plan begins; and (iv) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit the accounts of the Continuing
Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending account plan with any unused balances in the account of such Continuing Employees
under the Old Plan that is a flexible spending account plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time.
(f) Termination of Company 401(k) Plan. To the extent requested in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, (i) take all actions necessary to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, effective no later

relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (except
that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with
respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement and any applicable clean team or similar arrangement, and Section 8.3(a), as applicable). The Company Related
Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.3(e)(i).
(ii) The Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee, to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c), any liability pursuant to
Section 8.2(b), and the Company’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.8, as applicable, will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Company and each of the Company Related Parties against (A) Ultimate Parent, Parent, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and each of their
respective Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, heirs and assignees of each of Parent, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Affiliates (collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”) in respect of or relating to this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent payable, together with
any fees, costs, expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section 8.3(f), none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to
the Company or the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement and any applicable clean team or similar arrangement, and Section
8.3(a), as applicable). The Parent Related Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.3(e)(ii).
(f) Acknowledgements. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of this
Agreement and that, without this Section 8.3, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, respectively, all
fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees as well as reasonable and documented expenses incurred
in connection with any Legal Proceeding initiated by such Party in connection with such enforcement), together with interest on the amount of the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the
date such payment is required to be made. The Parties further acknowledge that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee
shall constitute a penalty but are each liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate each Party in the circumstances in which either
the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
8.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
 
71

no amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such approval.
8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, to the extent legally allowed and
except as otherwise set forth herein: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, as applicable; (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein applicable
to such Party (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single Party solely for purposes of this Section 8.5). Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising
any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

otherwise, without the prior written approval of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will relieve such

9.4 Confidentiality. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that Ultimate Parent and the Company have previously executed
the Confidentiality Agreement, that shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each Party and their respective Representatives
shall hold and treat all documents and information concerning the other Party furnished or made available in connection with the Merger in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each Party agrees to be bound by, and to instruct their Representatives to be bound
by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto.

to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to

9.6 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except (a) as set forth in or as contemplated by Section 6.9, (b) if the Closing occurs,
for the right of the holders of Company Common Stock to receive the Per Share Price and, (c) as set forth in or contemplated by Section 8.3(e).
9.7 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
9.8 Remedies.
(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein (including Section 8.3(e)), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and monetary damages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance
that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance).
(b) Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing
to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions; (ii) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof; (iii) neither the ability of either Party to recover damages for fraud or any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement nor the
provisions of Section 8.3 are intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s
right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (iv) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and
without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the
availability of or granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with this Section 9.8 to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants,
obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 9.8. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security. The Parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.8, a Party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement, and (y) nothing set forth in this Section
9.8 shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
Section 9.8 prior to, or as a condition to, exercising any termination right under Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.8 or anything set forth in this Section 9.8 restrict or limit any Party’s right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or
 
74
Table of Contents
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that, while the Company may pursue a grant of specific performance prior to the termination of this Agreement, following a valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to seek a grant of
specific performance to cause the Closing to occur; provided, that the Company may continue any ongoing proceeding for specific performance filed
prior to a purported termination of this Agreement subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
9.9 Ultimate Parent. The Parties agree and acknowledge that Ultimate Parent shall be a party to this Agreement solely for the purposes of Section
1.1 (to the extent the terms defined therein are used in the following Sections and Article of this Agreement) Section 3.28, Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section
4.3, Section 4.4, Section 4.5, Section 4.6, Section 4.9, Section 4.16, Section 6.2, Section 6.12, Section 6.18 and Article IX.
9.10 Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings, causes of action, claims or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort,
statute or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws, including any statutes of
limitations, of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
9.11 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process
(whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions, for and on behalf of itself
or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this
Section 9.11 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law, (b) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any
dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the Transactions, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts, (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of
any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same, and (f) agrees that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any
court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
9.12 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
(WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
 
75
75
Table of Contents
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.
9.13 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as
parties hereto.
9.14 Company Disclosure Letter References. The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if
the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.
9.15 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other
Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg
or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may
raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

agreement or understanding with respect to any of the Subject Shares that is in effect on the date hereof, and shall not enter into at any time prior to the

voluntarily or involuntarily, or enter into any Contract with respect to the Transfer of, any of the Subject Shares or any interest therein (whether by actual
disposition or effective economic disposition due to hedging, cash settlement or otherwise); provided that nothing herein shall prohibit a Stockholder
from the following: (A) Transfers or dispositions of the Subject Shares to any members of such Stockholder’s immediate family, to any trust for the direct
benefit of such Stockholder or the immediate family of such Stockholder or to a partnership, limited liability company or other entity of which the

agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Upon the execution and delivery of a joinder agreement by such

current or former marriage, domestic partnership or adoption, not more remote than first cousin.

and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold such Subject Shares subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities
and rights under this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until the valid termination of this Agreement.

its direct or indirect holders, and which does not result in the direct or indirect transfer of “control” (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of such
Stockholder and does not affect in any way such Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement, is permitted without notice or consent of any kind.
4. Further Assurances; Disclosure. From time to time and without additional consideration, each Stockholder shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, such additional instruments, and shall take such further actions, as Parent or the Company may reasonably request
for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each Stockholder hereby severally as to itself only, but not
jointly with any other Stockholder, authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in any public filing made in connection with the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and in any other announcement or disclosure required by applicable Law, such Stockholder’s
identity and ownership of the Subject Shares and the nature of such Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement and authorizes Parent and the
Company to include this Agreement as an exhibit to any filing required to be made by the Company or an Affiliate of Parent with the SEC in connection
with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
5. Representations and Warranties of Each Stockholder.
(a) Each Stockholder on its own behalf hereby represents and warrants to Parent, severally and not jointly, as of the date hereof with
respect to such Stockholder as follows:
(i) Organization. Such Stockholder, if not a natural Person, is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization.
(ii) Authority. Such Stockholder has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such

8. No Solicitation. Prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no Stockholder shall take any action that the Company’s
Representatives would then be prohibited from taking under Section 5.3 of the Merger Agreement.
9. No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or
incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Subject Shares. Except as provided in this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits
relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each such Stockholder, and neither Parent nor the Company shall have any authority
to exercise any power or authority to direct the Stockholder in the voting of any of the Subject Shares, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the arrangements contemplated by this Agreement are not intended to constitute the formation of a
“group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) either among the Stockholders or between any of the Stockholders and Parent.
10. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate without further action upon the earliest to occur of (i) the Effective Time, (ii)

liability for fraud or any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement prior to termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set forth in
Section 7 and in Sections 11 to 24 of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and all rights and remedies with
respect thereto, shall not survive the Expiration Date.
11. Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (a) the covenants, obligations and agreements contained
in this Agreement relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters, and (b) irreparable damage would occur and each such party would not have any
adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the other parties to this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or

posting of any such bond or similar instrument), this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at Law or in equity, and each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that such party
has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby further acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, each party shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be
performed by each of the other parties hereto under this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at Law or in equity,
including such party’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10. Each of the parties hereto

representation or warranty made in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws, including any statutes of
limitations, of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
13. Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, to the extent legally allowed and

Section 13). Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed

14. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HERETO

17. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further

fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as

person. No party hereto may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives
any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

contemplated by this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance, or breach of this Agreement.

case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such
compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which
the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of
stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.
 
8.
The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.
 
9.
Limitation of Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.
 
10.
Indemnification.
 
a.
Right to Indemnification and Advancement. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is
otherwise involved (including involvement, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to an employee benefit plan (an “indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than
permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees and related disbursements, judgments, fines,
excise taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time (“ERISA”) and
any other penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably
 
96

incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in this Section 10(a) with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification and advance of expenses (as defined below), the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with
a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in the specific
case by the board of directors of the Corporation. The rights to indemnification and advance of expenses conferred in this Section
10(a) shall be contract rights. In addition to the right to indemnification conferred herein, an indemnitee shall also have the right, to
the fullest extent not prohibited by law, to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (an “advance of expenses”); provided, however, that if and to the extent that the DGCL requires, an
advance of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an “undertaking”), by or on behalf of
such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal (a “final adjudication”) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
Section 10 or otherwise. The Corporation may also, by action of its board of directors, provide indemnification and advancement to
employees and agents of the Corporation. Any reference to an officer of the Corporation in this Section 10 shall be deemed to refer
exclusively to the President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Corporation, and to any Vice President, Assistant Secretary, Assistant
Treasurer or other officer of the Corporation appointed by the board of directors, and any reference to an officer of any other
enterprise shall be deemed to refer exclusively to an officer appointed by the board of directors or equivalent governing body of such
other entity pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of such other enterprise.
The fact that any person who is or was an employee of the Corporation or an employee of any other enterprise has been given or has
used the title of “Vice President” or any other title that could be construed to suggest or imply that such person is or may be an
officer of the Corporation or of such other enterprise shall not result in such person being constituted as, or being deemed to be, an
officer of the Corporation or of such other enterprise for purposes of this Section 10 unless such person’s appointment to such office
was approved by the board of directors.
 
b.
Procedure for Indemnification. Any claim for indemnification or advance of expenses by an indemnitee under this Section 10(b) shall
be made promptly, and in any event within forty-five days (or, in the case of an advance of expenses, twenty days, provided that the
director or officer has delivered the undertaking contemplated by Section 10(a) if required), upon the written request of the
indemnitee. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or advance of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in
full pursuant to such request is not made within forty-five days (or, in the case of an advance of expenses, twenty days, provided that
the indemnitee has delivered the undertaking contemplated by Section 10(a) if required), the right to indemnification or advances as
granted by this Section 10 shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person’s costs and
expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such
action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant to
Section 10(a), if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct which
make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proof
shall be on the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of
directors, a committee thereof, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
 
97
Table of Contents
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.
 
c.
Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was or has
agreed to become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her
in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify
such person against such expenses, liability or loss under the DGCL.
 
d.
Service for Subsidiaries. Any person serving as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity
interests are owned by the Corporation (a “subsidiary” for purposes of this Section 10) shall be conclusively presumed to be serving
in such capacity at the request of the Corporation.
 
e.
Reliance. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or
who, while a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be
conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights contained in this Section 10 in
entering into or continuing such service. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the rights to indemnification and to the advance of
expenses conferred in this Section 10 shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of acts or omissions which
occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the adoption hereof. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Section 10 that
adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any
such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took
place prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
f.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Continuation of Rights of Indemnification. The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses
conferred in this Section 10 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under the
certificate of incorporation or under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. All
rights to indemnification under this Section 10 shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer
of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Section 10 is in effect. Any repeal or modification of
this Section 10 or repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish
any rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses of such director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation arising
hereunder with respect to any proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final
adoption of such repeal or modification.
 
g.
Merger or Consolidation. For purposes of this Section 10, references to the “Corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if
its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or
agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or
 
98
Table of Contents
other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Section 10 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or
she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
 
h.
Savings Clause. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if this Section 10 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by
any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and advance expenses to each person entitled
to indemnification under Section 10(a) as to all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees and related disbursements,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and any other penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification and advancement of expenses is available to such
person pursuant to this Section 10 to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Section 10 that shall not have been
invalidated.
 
11.
Preservation of Rights. A right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation or the By-Laws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought, unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or
omission explicitly authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has occurred.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of Oak Street Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), of $39.00 per
Share in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger proposed to be entered into and
dated as of February 7, 2023 (the “Agreement”), by and among CVS Pharmacy, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (“Parent”), Halo Merger Sub Corp., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), the Company and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein,
CVS Health Corporation, a Delaware corporation and ultimate parent company of Parent (“CVS”). The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transaction”), as a
result of which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger (other than (i) each Share that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock or (B) owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub), in each case as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (ii) Shares subject to outstanding awards of Company
Restricted Stock (as defined in the Agreement) and (iii) Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) (the Shares referred to in clauses (i),
and (ii) and (iii), together with any Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, “Excluded Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive
$39.00 per Share in cash, without interest (the $39.00 per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of
the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our
services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us
against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and
merchant banking activities. In the past two years, except for our current engagement in respect of the Transaction, we have not been engaged to provide
financial advisory or other services to the Company, and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. We are currently
engaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to a portfolio company of General Atlantic Service Company, LP (“General
Atlantic”) (affiliates of which own approximately 25% of the Shares), and we may receive compensation from such company in the future. In 2022, our
restructuring team was engaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to a portfolio company of General Atlantic in
connection with certain restructuring-related matters, and we received compensation from such company. In 2021, we were engaged to provide financial

such services. In the past two years, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Parent or CVS, Parent’s ultimate parent
entity, and we have not received any compensation from Parent or CVS during such period. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or
with respect to the Company, Parent, CVS, General Atlantic or their respective affiliates, including portfolio companies of General Atlantic, in the future,
for which we may receive compensation. Certain (i) of our and our affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such
persons, (ii) of our affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial
interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments
(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, Parent, CVS, General Atlantic or any of their respective
affiliates, including portfolio companies of General Atlantic, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement dated February 7, 2023 (the “Draft
Agreement”); (ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020; (iii) certain interim reports
to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; (iv) certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; (v) certain
other communications from the Company to its stockholders; and (vi) certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash
flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the Company prepared by
management of the Company and furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis (the “Forecasts”) (collectively, the “Internal Data”). We
have also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the Company regarding their assessment of the
Internal Data. In addition, we reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for the Company and compared
that data with similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that we deemed relevant. We also
compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions
that we deemed relevant and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as we deemed
appropriate.
We have assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, regulatory,
tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion and have, with your consent, relied
upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, we have assumed, at your direction, that the Internal Data (including, without
limitation, the Forecasts) has been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company as to the matters covered thereby and we have relied, at your direction, on the Internal Data for purposes of our analysis and this opinion.
We express no view or opinion as to the Internal Data or the assumptions on which it is based. In addition, at your direction, we have not made any
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company, nor have
we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and we have not been asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical inspection of the
properties or assets of the Company. We have assumed, at your direction, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any respect material to our
analysis or this opinion from the Draft Agreement reviewed by us. We have also assumed, at your direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on
the terms set forth in the Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the
waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion and that, in
the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay,
limitation, restriction, condition or other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion. We have not
evaluated and do not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of the Company, or the ability of the

Company to pay its obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the Transaction on such matters, under any state, federal or other laws
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisors, and we express no opinion as to any legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
We express no view as to, and our opinion does not address, the Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the
Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the
Company or in which the Company might engage. This opinion is limited to and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date
hereof, to the holders of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We have
not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or the Transaction,
including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Agreement or
entered into in connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the Transaction or any other
term or aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be paid in connection therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any
other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or any other party. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the fairness
(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees
of the Company or any party, or class of such persons in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders
of the Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and other
conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof, and we do not have any obligation or
responsibility to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our opinion
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote
with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.
Our financial advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the
Company (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. The
issuance of this opinion was approved by the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications
and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
