1Life Healthcare Inc_20220824_DEFM14A_20299948_4508791.Pdf,The Special Meeting,"The Special Meeting
Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting
A special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be held virtually on September 22, 2022,
at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time via live audio webcast on the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ONEM2022SM (the “Special Meeting”).
At the Special Meeting, stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 22, 2022 (the “Record Date”) will be asked to consider and
vote on:
•
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to 1Life’s named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (the “Compensation Proposal”); and
•
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies to
approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
We do not expect that any matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special Meeting, and only matters specified in
the notice of the meeting may be acted upon at the Special Meeting.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
You are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Special Meeting if you owned any share(s) of common stock on the Record Date. Each holder
of common stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each such share of common stock owned on the Record Date on all matters properly coming
before the Special Meeting. As of the
1Table of Contents
Record Date, there were 195,812,174 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. A quorum is necessary to
adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Compensation Proposal. A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the
Special Meeting for the meeting to be properly held under our bylaws and Delaware law. The presence, in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business at the Special Meeting. Assuming the Special Meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, as it is
currently scheduled to be, no shares will be present in person at the Special Meeting, and only shares present virtually or represented by proxy at
the Special Meeting will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Your shares of common stock will be counted towards the quorum
only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee based on your instructions), if you vote
at the meeting or if you attend the Special Meeting but abstain from voting. If you hold your shares in “street name” and do not give any instruction
to your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the Special Meeting, those shares will not be entitled to vote on any
proposal at the Special Meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. The Special Meeting may be adjourned whether or
not a quorum is present.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Failure to Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of 1Life’s common stock on the Record Date is required to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Because the required vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the number of votes our stockholders
are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes actually cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy or vote online at the meeting, abstain from voting
at the meeting, or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as votes cast “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
As of August 22, 2022, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, 97,906,088 shares constitute a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter, provided a quorum is
present. Assuming the Special Meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be
present in person in at the Special Meeting, and only shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be able to be
voted. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-binding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires either (i) if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person,
by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject
matter or (ii) if a quorum is not present, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the Special Meeting.
An abstention represents a stockholder’s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention
will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal. However, abstentions are counted as shares present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted
for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but will count as a vote “AGAINST” each of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will also
count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger

Agreement. If your shares are not deemed present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, then a failure to vote will not have any effect on
the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. If your shares are deemed present or represented by proxy, then a failure to vote your
shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal only if a quorum is not present, and will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or, if a quorum is present, on the Adjournment Proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominees do not have
discretionary voting authority with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee
with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and will not be counted
for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in
street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no instruction as
to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and for purposes of establishing a quorum at
the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect
to any other proposal.

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,585,389 shares of common stock,

1Life Common Stock
At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the parties or any stockholder, each share of common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) common stock held in the treasury of 1Life or owned by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned 1Life subsidiary, (ii) common stock owned by Merger Sub, Amazon or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Amazon subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) any common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is
entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such common stock in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) (the “Dissenting Shares”) (collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii), the “Excluded
Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $18.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).
At or before the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), Amazon will deposit or cause to be deposited cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid under the Merger Agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, in its
capacity as the Paying Agent (as defined below), for the benefit of the holders of the common stock (other than Excluded Shares) of each share of
common stock owned by each stockholder. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of common stock that you own,
but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder. Stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights have the right to receive payment
for the “fair value” of their shares determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law. For more information, please
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of 1Life Options, 1Life RSUs and 1Life Phantom Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each:
(i)
1Life Option (as defined below) with an exercise price per share of common stock that is less than the Merger Consideration that is
vested or that accelerates vesting pursuant to its terms at the Effective Time (with any market or performance conditions determined in
accordance with the applicable award agreement), and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the per-share exercise price of such 1Life Option and (2) the number of shares then subject to such 1Life Option, less any applicable tax
withholdings;
(ii)
1Life Option with an exercise price per share of common stock that is less than the Merger Consideration that is unvested and is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such 1Life Option and (2) the number
of shares then subject to such 1Life Option, which will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to
such unvested 1Life Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and will vest in installments over the remainder of the vesting
schedule of such 1Life Option;
5Table of Contents
(iii)
1Life Option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share of common stock that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration will be cancelled without consideration;

1Life RSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the number of shares then subject to such 1Life RSU, and
such cash-based awards will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the 1Life RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time and will vest in installments over the remainder of the vesting schedule of such 1Life RSU; and
(vi)
1Life Phantom Award (as defined below) will remain outstanding at the Effective Time and continue to be subject to the same terms and
conditions as applicable to such 1Life Phantom Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Treatment of Purchase Rights under 1Life’s 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Merger Agreement generally provides that after July 20, 2022, no new offering periods will begin under 1Life’s 2020 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “1Life ESPP”), no 1Life employee may become a new participant in the 1Life ESPP and no 1Life ESPP participant may increase the
percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election. The current purchase period will terminate at the earlier of (1) the scheduled purchase
date for the current purchase period, which is November 15, 2022 and (2) immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each participant’s accumulated
payroll deductions will be used to purchase shares of common stock on such purchase date in accordance with the terms of the 1Life ESPP.
Contingent on closing of the Merger, the 1Life ESPP will terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. While two of our executive
officers currently participate in the 1Life ESPP, none of our executive officers have accumulated payroll deductions under the 1Life ESPP for the
offering period that commenced on May 16, 2022. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Treatment of Purchase Rights Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.”
Treatment of Convertible Notes
The Merger Agreement provides that, at and prior to the Closing, 1Life will (and Amazon will cooperate with 1Life to) comply with the Indenture (as
defined below), relating to the Convertible Notes (as defined below), including executing and delivering a supplemental indenture to the Indenture.
In the event that Amazon desires to consummate a Repurchase Transaction (as defined below), in Amazon’s sole discretion, with respect to any or
all of the Convertible Notes, each of 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with one
another in good faith to permit such Repurchase Transaction; provided that (i) the Repurchase Transaction will not be consummated prior to the
Closing; and (ii) Amazon will pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by 1Life in taking actions requested by
Amazon in connection with a Repurchase Transaction.
In the event that a Repurchase Transaction is not consummated at Closing, then the Closing will result in a “fundamental change” under the
Indenture governing the Convertible Notes, requiring 1Life to offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes for par value, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. For more information, please see the section in this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Convertible Notes.”

After considering various factors described in this proxy statement under the caption, “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board of Directors
and Reasons for the Merger,” 1Life’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (together with the Merger, the “Transactions”) are fair to, and in the best
interests of, 1Life and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Transactions by the
stockholders of 1Life and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of 1Life.
The Board of Directors also unanimously recommends, on behalf of 1Life, that stockholders vote: (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal.
Prior to receipt of the required stockholder approval, under certain specified circumstances, the Board of Directors may withdraw or change the
foregoing recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that an acquisition proposal is more favorable to the stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and the Transactions, subject to
certain matching rights in favor of Amazon. However, the Board of Directors cannot withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation unless it
complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, providing Amazon five (5) business days to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (as described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; 1Life Adverse Recommendation Change”). The termination of the
Merger Agreement by Amazon, prior to receipt of the required stockholder approval, following the withdrawal by the Board of Directors of its
recommendation that stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement will result in the payment by 1Life of the 1Life Termination Fee. The termination of
the Merger Agreement by 1Life, prior to receipt of the required stockholder approval, following the Board of Directors’ determination that 1Life enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) will result in the payment by 1Life of the 1Life Termination Fee. For

selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of and
involvement in recent transactions in 1Life’s industry. At the meeting of the 1Life Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion, dated July 20, 2022, to the 1Life Board of Directors, that, as of that date, and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the
review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of

When considering the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
stockholders should be aware that some of 1Life’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of stockholders more generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters,
to the extent that they existed at the time, in reaching the determination that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions were fair to and in the best
interests of 1Life and its stockholders, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the
Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, in making their recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Transactions and in directing that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the
stockholders. These interests include:
•
at the Effective Time of the Merger, each 1Life Option and 1Life RSU will receive the treatment described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of 1Life Options,
1Life RSUs and 1Life Phantom awards”;
•
continued eligibility of 1Life’s executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits (including equity award vesting
acceleration) under the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan (as defined below) and under the terms of the Retention 1Life
RSUs, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and

•
eligibility of 1Life’s non-employee directors to receive accelerated vesting of their 1Life RSUs and 1Life Options, as described in more
detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
—Equity Awards Held by 1Life’s Executive Officers and Non-employee Directors”; and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation.

in the same manner as outstanding shares of common stock held by all other stockholders. For more information, please see the section of this proxy

Appraisal Rights",15,15
1Life Healthcare Inc_20220824_DEFM14A_20299948_4508791.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders who continuously hold shares of 1Life common stock through the
effective date of the Merger, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
8Table of Contents
Merger Agreement and who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and exercise, and do not effectively waive, withdraw, fail to perfect or
otherwise lose, their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the
“fair value” of their shares of 1Life common stock (exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any), as determined by the court, as described further below in lieu of
receiving the Merger Consideration if the Merger is completed. The amount determined to be fair value by the court will be determined as of the
Effective Time and could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration for 1Life common stock. Voting “AGAINST” or failing to
vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the
DGCL.
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares or who wish to preserve their rights to do so
should review Annex C carefully and are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights since failure
to timely and fully comply with the procedures set forth therein may result in the loss of such rights.
To exercise appraisal rights, stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to 1Life before the stockholder vote is taken on the

Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold shares of 1Life common stock of record through the effective date of the Merger; and (iv) comply with all
other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to timely and fully comply with the procedures specified

you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”

The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption, “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”)
in exchange for shares of 1Life common stock in the Merger will be a taxable transaction to such stockholders for United States (the “U.S.”) federal
income tax purposes. Each such U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the
Merger. Backup withholding taxes may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder complies with
certification procedures under the backup withholding rules.
A stockholder that is a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption, “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such
Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the U.S. but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain
certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.

certain specified circumstances, to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal if 1Life complies with certain notice and other requirements and the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal is more favorable to the stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger and the Transactions, subject to certain matching rights in favor of Amazon. For more information, please see

breach (or deemed breach) of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement that the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or (y) an Intervening Event (as
defined below) occurs and as a result thereof the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the
failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; subject, in each case, to

Q:

A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $18.00 in cash, without interest thereon, for each share
of common stock that you own immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you are entitled to and have properly exercised and not waived,

stock, you will receive $1,800.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock. You will not receive any shares of the capital stock in the
Surviving Corporation.
Q:
What will holders of 1Life stock awards receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
At the Effective Time each:
•
1Life Option with an exercise price per share of common stock that is less than the Merger Consideration that is vested or that accelerates
vesting pursuant to its terms at the Effective Time (with any market or performance conditions determined in accordance with the applicable
award agreement), and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such 1Life
Option and (2) the number of shares then subject to such 1Life Option, less any applicable tax withholdings;
•
1Life Option with an exercise price per share of common stock that is less than the Merger Consideration that is unvested and is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product
of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such 1Life Option and (2) the number of shares
then subject to such 1Life Option, which will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to such unvested
1Life Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and will vest in installments over the remainder of the vesting schedule of such 1Life
Option;
•
1Life Option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share of common stock that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration will be cancelled without consideration;
•
1Life RSU that is vested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the number of shares then subject to such 1Life
RSU, less any applicable tax withholdings;

1Life Phantom Award will remain outstanding at the Effective Time and continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as
applicable to such 1Life Phantom Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger
Consideration—Treatment of 1Life Options, 1Life RSUs and 1Life Phantom Awards.”
Q:
What impact will the consummation of the Merger have on 1Life’s Convertible Notes?
A:
The Merger Agreement provides that, at and prior to the Closing, 1Life will (and Amazon will cooperate with 1Life to) comply with the Indenture
relating to the Convertible Notes, including executing and delivering a supplemental indenture to the Indenture.
The Closing of the Merger is considered a “fundamental change” under the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes, requiring 1Life to offer to
repurchase from holders the Convertible Notes for par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change
repurchase date. This will occur only following completion of the Merger. In the event that Amazon desires to consummate a Repurchase
Transaction, in Amazon’s sole discretion, each of 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with one another in good faith to permit such Repurchase Transaction; provided that (i) the Repurchase Transaction will not be
consummated prior to the Closing; and (ii) Amazon will pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by 1Life in
taking actions requested by Amazon in connection with a Repurchase Transaction.
For more information, see the section in this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—
Convertible Notes.”
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. In order to complete the Merger, 1Life must obtain the 1Life Stockholder
Approval described in this proxy statement, and the other conditions to Closing under the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived,
including the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the
HSR Act or any voluntary agreement with the DOJ or FTC not to consummate the Transactions. Since the Merger is subject to a number of
conditions, the exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not be entitled to,
nor will they receive, any payment for their shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, 1Life will remain an independent
public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to
file periodic reports under the Exchange Act with the SEC. Under certain specified circumstances, 1Life will be required to pay Amazon the 1Life
Termination Fee upon or following the termination of the Merger Agreement and under certain other specified circumstances, Amazon will be
required to pay 1Life the Amazon Termination Fee following the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses.”
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of 1Life’s common stock as of the Record Date is required to adopt the
Merger Agreement.
16
Table of Contents
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the
Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card); or (iii) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present
at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Q:
How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A:
The presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting. Assuming the Special Meeting is held
solely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be present in person at the Special Meeting, and only
shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Your shares of
common stock will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or
other nominee), if you vote at the meeting or if you attend the Special Meeting virtually but abstain from voting. If you return a properly signed and
dated proxy card without indicating voting preferences on the proxy card, your shares of common stock will be counted as present for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors. The
Special Meeting may be adjourned whether or not a quorum is present. If you hold your shares in “street name” and do not give any instruction to
your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the Special Meeting for any proposal, those shares will not be
entitled to vote on any proposal at the Special Meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. However, if you hold your
shares in “street name” and give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but give no
instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a
quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted
with respect to any other proposal.
As of the close of business on August 22, 2022, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, there were 195,812,174, shares of common stock
outstanding.
Q:
Why are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require 1Life to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that
may be paid or become payable to certain of its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter, provided a quorum
is present. Assuming the Special Meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be
present in person at the Special Meeting, and only shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be able to be voted.
The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-binding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
17
Table of Contents
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires either (i) if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person,
by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the
subject matter or (ii) if a quorum is not present, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the Special Meeting.
Q:
How does the 1Life Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that 1Life stockholders vote:
•
“FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
“FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal; and
•
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Board of Directors considered in determining to recommend that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement, please see the section captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — The Board of Directors’
Recommendation; 1Life Adverse Recommendation Change.” In addition, when considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors, you
should be aware that some of 1Life’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of stockholders more generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of 1Life’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Q:
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is
an advisory vote and will not be binding on 1Life. Therefore, if the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed,
the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will be payable to 1Life’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable agreements, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this
Compensation Proposal.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
A:
If you abstain from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger, the
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. However, abstentions are counted as shares present or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned
proposals will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but will count as a vote “AGAINST” each of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will also
count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are not deemed present or represented by proxy at the
Special Meeting, then a failure to vote will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. If your shares are
deemed present or represented by proxy, then a failure to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment
Proposal only if a quorum is not present, and will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or, if a quorum is present, on the Adjournment
Proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name does not
give voting instructions to the broker, bank

or other nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and will
not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of shares of
common stock held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but
gives no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will
not be voted with respect to any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to
vote your shares.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger
Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other
things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that
your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you
sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision
of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies 1Life in writing of
such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you
sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common
stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your
proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to
you by 1Life.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common stock held in
“street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect
to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. Because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your broker, bank
or other nominee is not authorized to vote your shares on any proposal without instructions from you. You are also invited to attend the Special
Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares virtually at the Special Meeting unless you have
obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, as the stockholder of record, authorizing you to vote your shares.

Table of Contents
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you
voted “AGAINST” adoption of the Merger Agreement and, only if a quorum is not present, the Adjournment Proposal, but will have no effect on
the Compensation Proposal or, if a quorum is present, the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting at the meeting.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common stock, and to
confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote
electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be
responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by proxy. If you are a
record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock virtually at
the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote virtually, your previous vote
by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other
nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of 1Life at 1Life Healthcare, Inc., One Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900,
San Francisco, CA 94111, by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 21, 2022; or
20
Table of Contents
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually. Attending the Special Meeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously
submitted proxy. You must specifically vote at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how
to change your vote. You may also vote virtually at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document describing the matters to be
considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of
common stock is called a “proxy card.”
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way
that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted: (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (iii) “FOR”
the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for
each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card.
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law,
stockholders of record who continuously hold shares of 1Life common stock through the effective date of the Merger, who do not vote in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and exercise, and do not effectively waive, withdraw,
fail to perfect or otherwise lose, their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of the “fair value” of their
shares (exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the
amount determined to be fair value, if any), as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration if the
Merger is completed. Appraisal rights will only be available to stockholders who are entitled and otherwise properly deliver, and do not properly
withdraw, a written demand for an appraisal to 1Life prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting and
who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The
appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the
21
Table of Contents
amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of the version of Section 262 of the DGCL
applicable to the Merger Agreement is included as Annex C to this proxy statement. For additional information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s), if any, now?
A:
No. If you are a record holder of a certificate or certificates that represent shares of 1Life common stock on the Record Date, a letter of transmittal
will be mailed to you promptly, and in any event within five (5) business days, after the Effective Time, describing, among other things, how you
should surrender your stock certificate(s) in respect of your shares of 1Life common stock in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Please do NOT return any stock certificate(s) with your proxy.
If your shares of 1Life common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your
broker, bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares of 1Life common stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, and you will not be mailed, and do not need to complete, a letter of transmittal.
Q:
Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A:
No. All holders of uncertificated shares (i.e., holders whose shares are held in book-entry form, including held in “street name” by your broker, bank
or other nominee) will automatically receive the applicable Merger Consideration for their shares of common stock shortly after the Merger is
completed without any further action required on the part of such holder.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
If available, 1Life may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. 1Life intends to publish final voting results in
a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that 1Life files with the SEC are publicly available
when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. A list of stockholders
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices located at 136 One Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900, San
Francisco, CA 94111, during regular business hours for a period of no less than ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and will be available
electronically at the Special Meeting.
The presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting. Assuming the Special Meeting is held solely by
means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be present in person at the Special Meeting, and only shares present
virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. As of the Record Date, there were
195,812,174 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, meaning that 97,906,088 shares of common stock must be
represented virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting to have a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected
that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of 1Life’s common stock on the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger
Agreement. As of the Record Date, 97,906,088 shares constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock. Adoption of the Merger
Agreement by stockholders is a condition to the Closing.
The affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at
the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter is required to approve the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory (non-binding)
basis, provided a

quorum is present. Assuming the Special Meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be
present in person at the Special Meeting, and only shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be able to be voted.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires either (i) if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person, by
remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter
or (ii) if a quorum is not present, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the Special Meeting.
An abstention represents a stockholder’s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will
have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal. However, abstentions are counted as shares present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting for the purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but will count as a vote “AGAINST” each of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
Failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to votes shares held on your behalf) will also
count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are not deemed present or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting, then a failure to vote will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. If your shares are deemed present or
represented by proxy, then a failure to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal only if a quorum is not
present, and will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or, if a quorum is present, on the Adjournment Proposal. Because brokers, banks and
other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal or
the Adjournment Proposal, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or
other nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and will not be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held
in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no instruction as to
one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special
Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other
proposal.
Shares Held by 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,585,389 shares of common stock,
representing approximately 1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the Record Date (and approximately 11% of the shares of common stock
outstanding when taking into account 1Life Options and 1Life RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers).
Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their respective shares of common stock (i) “FOR” the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal, and (iii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.",32,33

Background of the Merger",38,39
1Life Healthcare Inc_20220824_DEFM14A_20299948_4508791.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Board of Directors, together with 1Life senior management, and with the assistance of its outside advisors, frequently reviews 1Life’s strategic and
financial alternatives in light of developments in 1Life’s business, the sectors in which it operates, and the economy and financial markets generally, as
they, individually and together, may affect 1Life’s long-term strategic goals and plans, with the goal of enhancing stockholder value. As part of this
process, members of 1Life’s senior management have from time to time engaged in business development and strategic discussions with participants in
the healthcare industry and other market participants, all with the goal of enhancing value for stockholders, including by delivering the best possible
services to patients and customers. 1Life’s strategic discussions have focused on, among other things, opportunities for strategic transactions,
acquisitions, licensing transactions, commercial agreements and other financial and strategic alternatives for 1Life, including continuing as a standalone
company. In connection with evaluating these possible strategic and other opportunities, from time to time the Board of Directors has periodically sought
the advice of outside legal counsel and financial advisors to evaluate these strategic opportunities, including Morgan Stanley. 1Life selected Morgan
Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its knowledge of, and involvement in, recent
transactions in the industry in which 1Life operates and its knowledge of 1Life’s business and affairs.
In the fall of 2021, 1Life senior management and the Board of Directors began, in the context of long-range capital planning, an assessment of 1Life’s
ongoing operations and expansion plans, related cash flow projections, the impact of changes in capital markets, and the interplay between these factors
and the availability and attractiveness for any potential future third party funding of 1Life.
In mid-October 2021, a financial advisor for a strategic party (“Party A”) called Amir Dan Rubin, Chief Executive Officer and President of 1Life, and
indicated that Party A was interested in exploring a potential partnership or other strategic transaction with 1Life. Mr. Rubin and Party A’s financial
advisor agreed to find a time for 1Life management and representatives of Party A to discuss their respective businesses at a future date.
On October 26, 2021, Mr. Rubin and Bjorn Thaler, Chief Financial Officer of 1Life, met with the Chief Financial Officer of Party A and Party A’s financial
advisor, at which time Messrs. Rubin and Thaler provided a general overview of 1Life and its business, and the parties agreed to have future meetings to
continue to explore whether a potential partnership or other strategic transaction between 1Life and Party A would be beneficial to the respective
companies and their stockholders.
On November 15, 2021, the Board of Directors held a regularly scheduled meeting with 1Life senior management, during which Mr. Rubin provided a
regular strategic update on 1Life, including a description of discussions with Party A. The Board of Directors agreed that 1Life management should
continue exploratory discussions with Party A, along with other business opportunities that 1Life considers from time to time.
On November 16, 2021, 1Life and Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate due diligence between the parties in connection with a
potential partnership or other strategic transaction. The confidentiality agreement included a two year standstill provision with a customary exclusion
permitting Party A to make proposals to 1Life privately and confidentially.
Over the course of the next few months, members of 1Life senior management, representatives of Morgan Stanley, senior management of Party A and
Party A’s financial advisors engaged in a series of diligence meetings and preliminary discussions to explore a potential partnership or other strategic
transaction between the two
32Table of Contents
companies. 1Life’s senior management provided the Board of Directors with periodic updates on these discussions. During this period, the companies
and their financial advisors continued to discuss perspectives on structure and valuation, and 1Life management pointed representatives of Party A to
the financial forecasts made by 1Life and provided in 1Life’s proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed on July
6, 2021 (as amended on July 14, 2021, the “Form S-4”) as a basis for evaluating the future prospects of 1Life.
On January 31, 2022, a subset of independent directors of the Board of Directors consisting of Bruce W. Dunlevie, Robert R. Schmidt and Paul R. Auvil
(the “Board subgroup”) held a meeting with Messrs. Rubin and Thaler and Ms. Mango, General Counsel of 1Life. Members of 1Life senior management
had from time to time consulted with the Board subgroup regarding strategic transaction matters following 1Life’s initial public offering, including in
connection with 1Life’s acquisition of Iora Health, Inc., based on the constituent directors’ independence, experience with strategic transactions, existing
roles within the Board of Directors and willingness to serve in such roles. At the January 31 meeting, 1Life senior management updated the Board
subgroup on the status of discussions with Party A regarding a potential partnership or other strategic transaction with Party A, including that senior
management of 1Life had met several times with senior management of Party A, including Party A’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, but
that discussions were still preliminary, and that Party A had not to date either provided a specific indication of valuation or proposed a specific structure
for a potential transaction. Discussion ensued, including with respect to potential alternative business relationships or transaction structures. The Board
subgroup was supportive of 1Life’s senior management continuing discussions with Party A.
On February 9, 2022, representatives from Morgan Stanley facilitated an introductory meeting between Mr. Rubin and Carlo Bertucci, Vice President of
Corporate Development at Amazon to discuss potential areas of cooperation between 1Life and Amazon.
On February 25, 2022, Mr. Rubin and the Chief Financial Officer of Party A had a meeting during which they discussed a potential partnership or other
strategic transaction between 1Life and Party A and possible transaction structures for any such partnership or other strategic transaction.
On March 3, 2022, Mr. Rubin met with Mr. Bertucci and other Amazon representatives to discuss their respective businesses and potential areas of
cooperation between 1Life and Amazon.
Over the next few weeks, 1Life senior management and representatives of Amazon continued discussions with respect to a potential commercial
partnership or other strategic transaction between 1Life and Amazon.
On March 22, 2022, Mr. Rubin spoke with the Chief Financial Officer of Party A, who indicated that the alternative structures the companies had been
exploring did not seem feasible to Party A, but that Party A was interested in exploring a potential acquisition of 1Life, believed that Party A could get to a
valuation that would be at a significant premium to 1Life’s then-current stock price but that Party A would need to conduct additional diligence to solidify
its view on value.
From March 29, 2022 through the end of April 2022, 1Life management continued to engage in diligence and discussions concerning a potential strategic
transaction with representatives of Party A.
On April 1, 2022, the Board subgroup and David Kennedy (another independent director on the Board of Directors) held a meeting with 1Life senior
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cooley LLP (“Cooley”), 1Life’s external legal counsel. Mr. Rubin updated the Board subgroup
on the status of discussions with Party A and Amazon. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then presented an overview of the historical performance of
1Life’s stock price and a comparison with similarly situated companies. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also presented a summary of current market
conditions and the current challenges of raising capital. The members of 1Life senior management noted 1Life was exploring potentially raising around
$300 million by the end of 2022, and those present at the meeting discussed the impact of current market
33
Table of Contents
conditions and current challenges of raising capital on a potential capital raise of that size. Mr. Thaler then reviewed management’s financial projections,
which included two scenarios, the “Management Case A” and “Management Case B” (together, the “Projections”) which differed primarily with respect
to the view on future growth, with Management Case A showing lower growth primarily beginning in 2024 due to the impact of the current environment
on 1Life’s long-term, standalone growth strategy and capital position. For more information on the Projections and the assumptions contained therein,
please see “Recommendations of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger—Financial Projections”. Morgan Stanley then reviewed preliminary
financial analyses with the Board subgroup along with potential strategies with respect to a transaction process, including potential outreach to
counterparties other than Party A and Amazon. Representatives from Cooley reviewed with the Board subgroup fiduciary duties attendant to any review
of strategic alternatives. Discussion ensued regarding 1Life’s commercial, strategic, and growth opportunities, including the timing and structure of a
potential capital raise. The Board subgroup also discussed whether 1Life should conduct additional targeted outreach to third parties at that time that
might be interested in exploring a potential strategic transaction. The Board subgroup agreed that 1Life management should continue discussions with
Party A and Amazon and continue exploring capital raising alternatives, and agreed that further consideration was warranted with respect to whether to
conduct additional outreach to third parties that might be interested in exploring a potential strategic transaction.
From April 1, 2022 until April 26, 2022, 1Life senior management continued to meet with representatives of Amazon to determine whether a potential
commercial partnership or other strategic transaction could be mutually beneficial.
On April 16, 2022, the Board subgroup and Mr. Kennedy held a meeting with 1Life senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Cooley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley presented an overview of various alternatives for raising up to $300 million in financing by the end of 2022
and discussed with the Board subgroup certain challenges with respect to raising such financing in the current market conditions. Mr. Rubin updated the
Board subgroup on the status of ongoing discussions with each of Party A and Amazon, and following discussion, the Board subgroup agreed that 1Life
senior management should continue discussions with each of Party A and Amazon.
On April 18, 2022, 1Life provided Party A with access to an electronic data room.
On April 20, 2022, the Board subgroup and Mr. Kennedy held a meeting with 1Life senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Cooley. Mr. Rubin provided an update on the diligence progress and discussions with each of Party A and Amazon. The Board subgroup was supportive
of 1Life management continuing such discussions.
Later on April 20, 2022, Messrs. Rubin and Thaler met with Mr. Bertucci and noted that 1Life management had instructed representatives of Cooley to
begin negotiating a confidentiality agreement between 1Life and Amazon with representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul
Weiss”), Amazon’s external legal counsel, which would take the form of an amendment to an existing commercial non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.
On April 23, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with 1Life senior management, with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cooley in attendance.
The representatives of Morgan Stanley presented an overview of the current state of the capital markets and the performance of 1Life stock and Morgan
Stanley’s preliminary financial analyses with the Board of Directors. Members of 1Life senior management also presented the Projections to and
discussed the Projections with the Board of Directors. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also summarized financing alternatives that would be available
to achieve 1Life’s future growth forecasts as set forth in the Projections. Following a discussion of the presentation, Mr. Rubin then updated the Board of
Directors on the status of strategic discussions with each of Party A and Amazon, including with respect to the matters on which the Board subgroup
had been briefed at its April 1, 2022 meeting, and representatives of Cooley reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors attendant to any
review of strategic alternatives.
34
Table of Contents
Following discussion, the Board of Directors agreed that 1Life management should continue discussions with Party A and Amazon over the coming
weeks and discussed whether 1Life should conduct outreach to additional potential counterparties. The Board of Directors determined that additional
outreach should not be conducted at that time, due to the Board of Directors’ belief that (i) the existing set of alternatives being explored were the
potential opportunities most likely to be in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders, (ii) the other potential strategic parties to acquire 1Life would
not be viable counterparties based on historical interactions between representatives of 1Life and such parties, (iii) exploring additional alternatives at
that time was likely to present a significant risk of leak, and both such additional exploration and the result of any such leak presented a significant risk of
disruption to 1Life’s business.
On April 24, 2022, 1Life entered into an amendment to an existing commercial non-disclosure agreement between 1Life and Amazon, which amendment
included a nine-month standstill provision with a customary exclusion permitting Amazon to make proposals to 1Life privately and confidentially, and
provided that the standstill obligations automatically terminate following entrance by 1Life into a definitive agreement providing for a change of control
of 1Life.
On April 26, 2022, Messrs. Rubin and Thaler met with Mr. Bertucci to communicate 1Life’s valuation expectations for a potential strategic transaction.
Messrs. Rubin and Thaler indicated that in order to be compelling, an Amazon proposal would need to reflect a significant premium to 1Life’s then-
current share price. Mr. Bertucci indicated that Amazon would soon provide its view on a potential strategic transaction.
On April 27, 2022, Messrs. Rubin and Thaler met with Mr. Bertucci and another representative of Amazon. Mr. Bertucci stated that Amazon would be
unlikely to be able to meet 1Life’s valuation expectations for a strategic transaction, but that Amazon would consider continuing discussions regarding a
potential commercial partnership or investment in 1Life.
Later on April 27, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Party A’s financial advisors met to continue to discuss a potential strategic transaction
between Party A and 1Life.
On April 28, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with 1Life senior management and representatives of Cooley in attendance. Management of 1Life
provided an update on discussions with Party A and Amazon. Mr. Thaler noted that due diligence was progressing with Party A but that Party A had not
provided an offer at that time. Mr. Rubin communicated that Amazon had paused discussions on a potential acquisition of 1Life, but that discussions
with Amazon regarding a commercial partnership were ongoing. Following discussion, the Board of Directors directed management to continue
discussions with each of Party A and Amazon regarding a strategic transaction.
Over the course of May 2022, members of 1Life senior management held diligence meetings and discussions with representatives of Party A regarding a
potential acquisition of 1Life by Party A. During the same time period, members of 1Life senior management continued to meet with representatives of
Amazon regarding a potential commercial partnership.
On June 1, 2022, the Chief Financial Officer of Party A called Mr. Rubin and provided a verbal, non-binding proposal to acquire 1Life for $17.00 per share
in cash, and requested 30 days of exclusivity from 1Life in order to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive transaction documents with respect to
the potential acquisition. Mr. Rubin noted that he would discuss Party A’s offer, including the proposed exclusivity period, with the Board of Directors
the following day at a regularly scheduled meeting, and that if Party A was able to provide a more compelling offer to 1Life, the time to do so would be
prior to such meeting.
In the morning of June 2, 2022, the Chief Financial Officer of Party A called Mr. Rubin and provided a verbal, non-binding proposal to acquire 1Life for an
increased price of $18.00 per share in cash (“Party A’s $18.00 per share proposal”). Mr. Rubin noted that he would relay Party A’s $18.00 per share
proposal to the Board of Directors at the meeting later that morning.

Table of Contents
Later on June 2, 2022, the Board of Directors held a regularly scheduled meeting with management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and
representatives of Cooley. 1Life management reviewed for the Board of Directors the current status of discussions with Party A and Amazon, including
Party A’s $18.00 per share proposal and the view of 1Life management that Amazon had recently deprioritized discussions. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley presented an overview of the capital markets, the performance of 1Life stock, and other financial analyses. Following discussion, the Board of
Directors directed 1Life senior management to continue negotiating a potential strategic transaction involving an acquisition of 1Life by Party A for
$18.00 per share on an expedited timeline, but to communicate to Party A that 1Life would not agree to Party A’s request for exclusivity, and determined
that at the right time, as determined by 1Life senior management, 1Life senior management or representatives of Morgan Stanley should contact Amazon
to convey that 1Life had received an offer to be acquired and provide Amazon with an opportunity to engage in a competitive process.
On June 3, 2022, Mr. Rubin called the Chief Financial Officer of Party A and relayed that 1Life was willing to negotiate a potential strategic transaction
involving an acquisition of 1Life by Party A for $18.00 per share, but would not do so on an exclusive basis, and that any such transaction would need to
be finalized on an expedited timeline.
Between June 8, 2022 and June 17, 2022, representatives of 1Life, its legal and financial advisors, and representatives of Party A and its legal and financial
advisors, engaged in diligence meetings and negotiations, including negotiation of transaction documents in connection with Party A’s $18.00 per share
proposal.
On June 9, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Mr. Bertucci to inform Amazon that 1Life had received an offer from a strategic party for an
acquisition of 1Life and that 1Life was moving forward on an accelerated timeline with such party, but that 1Life would be open to engaging in
discussions regarding a similar transaction with Amazon if Amazon were to present a compelling offer. Mr. Bertucci indicated that Amazon might be
interested in providing an offer to acquire 1Life instead of a commercial partnership.
On June 10, 2022, first 1Life management and then representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Mr. Bertucci to provide updated valuation guidance for a
potential strategic transaction with 1Life.
On June 15, 2022, a representative of Morgan Stanley met with an Amazon representative to discuss the process for a potential strategic transaction.
On June 16, 2022, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Thaler met with Mr. Bertucci and other Amazon representatives to reiterate that 1Life was continuing to move
forward with other strategic alternatives and to explore Amazon’s interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with 1Life. In light of 1Life’s other strategic
alternatives, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Thaler communicated that in order to be competitive, Amazon would need to provide a proposal to 1Life expeditiously
that reflected a substantial premium to 1Life’s then-current stock price, and that such transaction would need to be executed on an accelerated timeline.
Mr. Bertucci indicated that Amazon would need significantly more due diligence information in order to determine whether and at what valuation it could
submit an offer, and requested access to 1Life’s existing data room for Amazon in order to conduct such diligence.
Later on June 16, 2022, Amazon was given access to 1Life’s virtual data room.
On June 17, 2022, Mr. Rubin met with the Chief Financial Officer of Party A, who conveyed that Party A had concerns about the expedited timeline
previously agreed upon, and the two executives agreed to reconnect soon.
On June 18, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Amazon’s financial advisor, to discuss the
process for a potential strategic transaction.

On June 19, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with management and representatives of Cooley and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Rubin updated the
Board of Directors on the status of negotiations with Amazon and Party A. The Board of Directors agreed that management should continue strategic
transaction discussions with Amazon and Party A.
On June 20, 2022, Mr. Rubin and the Chief Financial Officer of Party A resumed their conversation from June 17, 2022, and the Chief Financial Officer of
Party A communicated that Party A still had concerns about executing a strategic transaction on an expedited timeline, and would reach back out to Mr.
Rubin.
Over the course of the next several weeks, representatives of 1Life and Amazon exchanged additional diligence information and held additional diligence
meetings.
On June 23, 2022, Mr. Rubin met with Mr. Bertucci to discuss a potential strategic transaction between the parties and emphasized that 1Life expected any
potential strategic transaction to be executed on an expedited timeline and that any offer would need to be provided quickly and at a significant premium
to 1Life’s then-current stock price in order to be compelling.
On June 24, 2022, Mr. Bertucci called Mr. Rubin and indicated that Amazon would be willing to offer $16.00 per share in cash to acquire 1Life (Amazon’s
“$16.00 per share offer”). Mr. Rubin replied that he would relay the offer to the Board of Directors but that $16.00 per share was unlikely to be compelling,
and that a higher price would likely be required in order for the Board of Directors to authorize 1Life senior management and legal and financial advisors
to negotiate definitive transaction documents with Amazon. Mr. Bertucci responded that he would discuss the possibility of an improved proposal with
Amazon management and would respond to Mr. Rubin within a few days.
On June 27, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with 1Life senior management and representatives of Cooley and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Rubin
relayed Amazon’s $16.00 per share offer and his conversation with Mr. Bertucci. Following discussion, Board of Directors instructed Mr. Rubin to
continue discussions with Amazon in order to seek to increase Amazon’s $16.00 per share proposal and agreed that draft transaction documents (on
substantially the terms last exchanged with Party A, which terms had previously been reviewed with the Board of Directors by 1Life management and
representatives of Cooley) should only be provided to Amazon if Amazon sufficiently increased its offer.
On June 27, 2022, Mr. Rubin called Mr. Bertucci and relayed that Amazon would need to increase its $16.00 per share offer in order for the Board of
Directors to determine that Amazon’s offer was compelling, that 1Life was considering other strategic alternatives, and that in light of such other strategic
alternatives, 1Life would not engage in transaction document negotiations at $16.00 per share. Mr. Bertucci said he would discuss with Amazon senior
management whether Amazon was able to provide an increased offer and would provide an update in the next few days.
Over the next several days, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Bertucci had multiple telephone discussions concerning the potential strategic transaction.
On July 2, 2022, Mr. Bertucci called Mr. Rubin and informed him that, following discussions with Amazon senior management, Amazon was willing to offer
$18.00 per share in cash to acquire 1Life (the “$18.00 per share proposal”), subject to additional confirmatory due diligence information. Later on July 2,
2022, Amazon delivered a written non-binding indication of interest reflecting a $18.00 per share proposal and proposing a target date of July 18, 2022 to
execute a definitive merger agreement, which also indicated that Amazon would disengage in the event of a leak of its interest in such a strategic
transaction.
Later on July 2, 2022, at the direction of 1Life management, representatives of Cooley sent representatives of Paul Weiss draft transaction documents,
which contemplated among other matters (i) a reverse termination fee to be paid by Amazon in the amount of $400 million (representing more than 10% of
1Life’s equity value at Amazon’s proposed purchase price) payable in instances where regulatory approval was not obtained, (ii) a
37
Table of Contents
termination fee amount equal to 2.5% of 1Life’s equity value in circumstances involving a competing offer for 1Life, and (iii) given 1Life’s growth
ambitions and the potential closing timeline for a strategic transaction with Amazon, unsecured interim debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of
up to $300 million, beginning January 1, 2023 and with a maturity date of 24 months after the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to its terms.
On July 3, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with management and representatives of Cooley and Morgan Stanley in attendance. Mr. Rubin
updated the Board of Directors on discussions with Amazon, including Amazon’s $18.00 per share proposal and Amazon’s proposed announcement date
of July 18, 2022. Mr. Rubin noted that Amazon would be performing additional diligence and that the parties were beginning to negotiate the transaction
documents. Mr. Rubin also updated the Board of Directors on his conversations with Party A. The Board of Directors directed Mr. Rubin to notify Party
A that 1Life was moving forward on an expedited timeline with other strategic alternatives, in order to determine if Party A would engage on a similarly
expedited timeline. The Board of Directors instructed Mr. Rubin to continue discussions with Amazon and to determine if Amazon would be willing to
offer a price greater than $18.00 per share.
Later on July 3, 2022, Mr. Rubin called Mr. Bertucci to report that the Board of Directors was supportive of continued discussions with Amazon, but had
not yet determined that Amazon’s proposed $18.00 per share price was in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders and encouraged Mr. Bertucci to
return with a higher price.
On July 5, 2022, Mr. Rubin and the Chief Financial Officer of Party A had a conversation in which Mr. Rubin relayed that if Party A had continued interest
in exploring a strategic relationship with 1Life, then time was of the essence as 1Life was exploring its strategic alternatives on an expedited timeline. The
Chief Financial Officer of Party A indicated that he would share this information with Party A leadership and would follow up.
Later on July 5, 2022, Bloomberg and other media publications reported rumors that 1Life was exploring strategic alternatives after potential acquirers
expressed preliminary interest in a strategic transaction with 1Life. Following the reports, 1Life’s stock price closed at $10.34 on July 5, 2022, compared to
$8.28 on July 1, 2022 (the trading day immediately prior to the reports).
On July 7, 2022, Mr. Rubin met with Mr. Bertucci and another representative of Amazon, to discuss the potential strategic transaction.
On July 8, 2022, representatives of Paul Weiss sent representatives of Cooley revised drafts of the transaction documents which included (i) a reverse
termination fee of 5% of equity value, (ii) a termination fee of 3.75% of equity value, (iii) reimbursement of Amazon’s transaction expenses up to 1% of
equity value if the merger agreement was terminated due to 1Life stockholder approval not being obtained or 1Life breaches of the merger agreement, and
(iv) senior secured interim debt financing, with funding permitted only if 1Life’s cash balance was below a certain level, beginning ten months after
execution of the merger agreement and with a maturity date of three months’ prior to the maturity of 1Life’s convertible notes.
On July 12, 2022, representatives of Cooley sent representatives of Paul Weiss revised drafts of the merger agreement and key terms for the unsecured
interim debt financing. The revised drafts included (i) a reverse termination fee of $300 million, (ii) a termination fee of 2.75% of equity value, (iii) no
expense reimbursement, and (iv) interim debt financing on substantially the same terms as 1Life proposed on July 2, 2022, except that funding would
begin eight months after the execution of the merger agreement.
On July 13, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with management and representatives of Cooley and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Rubin provided an
update on the status of negotiations with Amazon and noted that Amazon had not yet provided an updated price following Amazon’s $18.00 per share
proposal, which was subject to additional confirmatory due diligence information and review of preliminary estimates of 1Life’s financial performance for
the second fiscal quarter of 2022. Mr. Rubin and representatives of Cooley also
38
Table of Contents
provided a summary of certain terms in the merger agreement and the status of discussions with Amazon related thereto, including the interim debt
financing, reverse termination fee, 1Life termination fee and expense reimbursement, and operating covenants related to employee retention. Following
discussion, the Board of Directors authorized 1Life management and representatives of Cooley to continue to negotiate for the best terms possible in the
merger agreement. Mr. Rubin also updated the Board of Directors on his conversation with Party A on July 5, 2022 and indicated that Party A had not re-
engaged in strategic transaction discussions with 1Life. Following discussion, the representatives of Morgan Stanley left the meeting. 1Life’s
management then reviewed and discussed with the Board of Directors the status of the terms of the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley for the Board
management then reviewed and discussed with the Board of Directors the status of the terms of the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley for the Board
of Directors’ consideration. Following such discussion, subject to 1Life management and Morgan Stanley reaching an agreement on fees and other terms
in the engagement letter and subject to the Board of Directors’ review of the relationships disclosure memorandum, the Board of Directors approved the
formal engagement of Morgan Stanley and authorized management to enter into a formal engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.
On July 14, 2022, Mr. Rubin met with members of Amazon senior management to discuss 1Life’s business and to engage in other targeted diligence
discussions.
On July 15, 2022, representatives of Paul Weiss sent representatives of Cooley revised drafts of the transaction documents, which included terms largely
consistent with Amazon’s initial proposal.
On July 16, 2022, members of 1Life senior management met with representatives of Amazon, and with representatives of Cooley and Paul Weiss also in
attendance, to negotiate key outstanding issues in the transaction documents.
Later on July 16, 2022, representatives of Paul Weiss confirmed to representatives of Cooley that Amazon (i) would continue to require that the reverse
termination fee be limited to 5% of equity value, but would agree to (ii) the interim debt financing being unsecured, available March 2023 with no maximum
cash condition, and with a maturity date of 24 months following termination of the merger agreement, (iii) a 1Life termination fee of 3.5% of equity value,
(iv) expense reimbursement up to $20 million and only if 1Life stockholder approval was not obtained, and (v) compromises on the employee matters
related to 1Life’s operation of the business during the pre-Closing period.
On July 17, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with management and representatives of Cooley and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Rubin provided an
update on the status of negotiations with Amazon, and reported that Amazon had confirmed its $18.00 per share proposal and indicated that Amazon was
not willing to raise its price. Mr. Rubin and representatives of Cooley reviewed with the Board of Directors certain terms in the merger agreement and the
status of discussions with Amazon related thereto, including the interim debt financing, reverse termination fee, 1Life termination fee and expense
reimbursement, and operating covenants applicable during the pre-closing period. Mr. Rubin also discussed with the Board of Directors Amazon’s
expectation that Mr. Rubin would sign an employment letter concurrently with the entry into the merger agreement, but indicated that he had not received
any proposal from Amazon at that time and that he had not engaged in any employment-related discussions with Amazon. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley reviewed for the Board of Directors financial aspects of Amazon’s $18.00 per share proposal and certain preliminary financial analyses conducted
by Morgan Stanley using the Projections, consistent with prior discussions of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors then discussed various
matters related to the transaction, including general market dynamics, the regulatory landscape, the lack of contact from other potential acquirers
following the July 5th media reports of rumors of a potential strategic transaction involving 1Life and the lack of further engagement from Party A, and
the belief of the Board of Directors that additional negotiation on price was highly unlikely to result in an increased offer from Amazon and instead could
put the transaction at risk, including due to the risk of leak with ongoing discussions and the fact that Amazon stated that it would disengage if there
were any rumors or public speculation about its potential interest in such a strategic transaction. Following additional discussion, the Board
39
Table of Contents
of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders to continue to pursue a transaction with Amazon under the terms of
Amazon’s $18.00 per share proposal. The Board of Directors directed management to continue to negotiate for the best terms possible in the merger
agreement consistent with prior discussions with the Board of Directors, and to confirm to Amazon that 1Life management was authorized to negotiate
and finalize the transaction documents under Amazon’s $18.00 per share proposal. The Board of Directors also authorized Mr. Rubin to engage in
discussions with Amazon regarding post-closing employment arrangements with Amazon in connection with signing the definitive transaction
agreements.
Later on July 17, 2022, Mr. Rubin called Mr. Bertucci to inform Mr. Bertucci of the Board of Directors’ direction to 1Life management negotiate with
Amazon towards a final merger agreement with respect to Amazon’s $18.00 per share proposal.
Over the course of July 17 to July 20, 2022, representatives of Cooley and Paul Weiss exchanged several revised versions of the transaction documents,
reflecting the parties’ discussions.
On July 18, 2022, representatives from Amazon provided a draft offer letter and restrictive covenant agreement to Mr. Rubin, each of which Amazon
expected Mr. Rubin to sign in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and which would be effective as of the closing of the Merger.
On July 19, 2022, Mr. Rubin and Amazon finalized discussions regarding Mr. Rubin’s employment letter and restrictive covenant agreement.
Also on July 19, 2022, Mr. Thaler provided the Board of Directors with the final terms of the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley and Morgan
Stanley’s relationships disclosure memorandum for the Board of Directors’ review.
On July 20, 2022, 1Life entered into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.
Later on July 20, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting with management and representatives of Cooley and Morgan Stanley to review the final
Amazon $18.00 per share proposal. Representatives of Cooley reviewed with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties applicable in connection with a
strategic transactions process and the material terms of the draft Merger Agreement, including (a) the commitment by Amazon to provide senior
unsecured interim debt financing to 1Life in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million to be funded in up to ten tranches of $30 million per
month, beginning in March 2023 until the earlier of Closing and the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, with a maturity date of 24
months after the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, (b) the $195 million reverse termination fee to be paid by Amazon to 1Life in
certain limited circumstances if antitrust closing conditions were not satisfied, (c) the $136 million termination fee to be paid by 1Life to Amazon in certain
limited circumstances, including in the event 1Life were to terminate the Amazon transaction in order to accept a Superior Proposal, (d) the conditions to
closing of the Merger, and (e) certain employee related matters, including related to 1Life’s operation of the business in between signing of the Merger
Agreement and closing of the Merger. The Board of Directors asked questions regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and the potential risks
associated with the completion of the Merger, and discussion ensued. Morgan Stanley then reviewed with the Board of Directors its financial analysis of
the merger consideration and delivered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of
that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Morgan Stanley’s opinion, the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock of 1Life in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For
more information about the opinion of Morgan Stanley, see below under the caption “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley.” The Board of Directors
then discussed the potential transaction with Amazon, and, after carefully considering the matters discussed during that meeting and prior meetings of
the Board of Directors (for more information, see the section captioned “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the
Merger”), including the Board’s belief that
40
Table of Contents
(a) as a result of the negotiation process, 1Life had obtained Amazon’s best offer of $18.00 per share, (b) Amazon’s final offer of $18.00 per share
represented the highest price reasonably obtainable by 1Life under the circumstances, and (c) it was highly unlikely that another acquiror would be
willing to pay a higher price, including based on the lack of any contact from potential acquirers following the July 5, 2022 media reports of rumors of a
potential strategic transaction including 1Life and the lack of further engagement from Party A after July 5, 2022 the Board unanimously (i) determined
that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions were fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Transactions by the
stockholders of the Company, and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders at a
special meeting of the stockholders. For more information concerning the factors that the Board of Directors considered, see the section captioned “The
Merger—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger.” Following that discussion, the Board of Directors unanimously
determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
1Life and its stockholders, and authorized and directed 1Life senior management to execute the final Merger Agreement with Amazon.
Later that evening on July 20, 2022, 1Life and Amazon executed the Merger Agreement.
On July 21, 2022, prior to the opening of trading on the U.S. stock markets, 1Life and Amazon issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the
Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, 1Life
and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions, (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of 1Life and (iv)
directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of 1Life.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of 1Life, that you vote: (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the
Compensation Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of 1Life, that you vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
At a meeting held on July 20, 2022, the Board of Directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in
the best interests of, 1Life and its stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions; (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Transactions by the
stockholders of 1Life; and (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of 1Life’s stockholders.
In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board of Directors consulted with 1Life management, its independent legal advisor,
Cooley, and its independent financial advisor, Morgan Stanley,
41Table of Contents
and considered the following reasons (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which the Board of Directors viewed as generally
supporting its determination and recommendation:
•
Compelling Premium: the fact that the Merger Consideration of $18.00 in cash, without interest thereon, per share of 1Life common stock
represents a compelling premium to historical market prices for the shares of 1Life common stock, including that the Merger Consideration
constitutes a premium of:
•
approximately 117% to the closing price of 1Life common stock of $8.28 per share on July 1, 2022, the last full trading day prior to
published rumors regarding a possible strategic transaction involving 1Life (the “Unaffected Date”);
•
approximately 83% to the closing price of 1Life common stock of $9.86 per share on July 19, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement;
•
approximately 115% to the 30-day trading period volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of 1Life common stock prior to the
Unaffected Date; and
•
approximately 103% to the 90-day trading period VWAP of 1Life common stock prior to the Unaffected Date.
•
Attractive Valuation: the Board of Directors believes that the Merger Consideration provides stockholders with attractive value for their
shares of 1Life common stock, based on, among other things, the current and historical market prices for 1Life common stock, current
industry conditions and the Board of Directors’ familiarity with 1Life’s business, operations, prospects, strategic, short and long term
operating plans, assets and properties, liabilities and financial condition. After its review, the Board of Directors believed that $18.00 in cash,
without interest thereon, per share of 1Life common stock represented the best value reasonably available for holders of common stock,
while providing an opportunity, in certain circumstances, to consider an unsolicited Superior Proposal made after the announcement of the
Merger Agreement;
•
Certainty of Value: the fact that the Merger Consideration of $18.00 in cash, without interest thereon, per share of 1Life common stock is
payable solely in cash, which offers immediate liquidity and certain value to 1Life stockholders in respect of their shares of 1Life common
stock, eliminating the risks and uncertainties inherent in 1Life continuing as a standalone company as described below, taking into account
1Life’s business, operations, prospects, strategic, short and long term operating plans, assets and properties, liabilities and financial
condition;
•
Opinion of Morgan Stanley: the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion to the
Board of Directors, to the effect that, as of July 20, 2022 (the date of the opinion) and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set
forth in Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of 1Life common stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders of common stock, as more fully described below in the section captioned “Opinion of Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC.” For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger–Opinion of Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC,” and the full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement in its entirety;
•
Highest Offer: the Board of Directors’ belief that (i) as a result of an active negotiating process over the course of several months, 1Life had
obtained Amazon’s best offer and the best offer reasonably available to 1Life under the circumstances, (ii) there was significant risk of
losing the favorable opportunity with Amazon in the event 1Life continued trying to pursue any additional offers at higher prices, including
due to the risk that discussions of a potential strategic transaction would leak to the
42
Table of Contents
public and the fact that that Amazon stated it would disengage if there were any rumors or public speculation about its potential interest in
such a strategic transaction; and (iii) there was unlikely to be another acquiror of 1Life willing to pay a higher price than the Merger
Consideration, including based on the absence of any contact from potential acquirors following the release of the article in Bloomberg
News on July 5, 2022 speculating about a potential strategic transaction involving 1Life. For more information, please see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Background of the Merger”;
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives: the Board of Directors determined that none of the possible alternatives to the Merger (including the
possibility of continuing to operate 1Life as an independent company without a significant capital raise, pursuing a different strategic
transaction or pursuing a significant capital raise, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives, as well as the potential
benefits and risks to 1Life’s stockholders of those alternatives, and the timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably
likely to present superior opportunities for 1Life to create greater value for its stockholders taking into account execution risks as well as
business, competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory considerations.
•
Review Process: the Board of Directors conducted a thorough process and considered 1Life’s business, strategy, business plan, prospects
and alternatives over an extended period, including that the Board of Directors met seven times in the seven week period from June 2, 2022
and July 20, 2022, with 1Life’s independent legal and financial advisors in attendance as needed;
•
Interim Debt Financing: the fact that under the Merger Agreement, 1Life has the ability to obtain senior unsecured interim debt financing
from Amazon in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million to be funded in up to ten tranches of $30 million per month, beginning
on March 20, 2023 until the earlier of Closing and the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, with a maturity date of 24
months after the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms;
•
Likelihood of Completion: the likelihood that the Closing of the Merger would be achieved under the terms of the Merger Agreement
based on:
•
the financial strength of Amazon and its ability to fund the Merger Consideration with cash available;
•
the absence of any financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
•
the business reputation and capabilities of Amazon, including Amazon’s track record of successfully completing merger and
acquisition transactions;
•
the commitment made by Amazon to 1Life to use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approval, including a commitment to
defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any governmental authority or any other person under antitrust
laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date. For
more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Efforts
to Close the Merger”; and
•
the likelihood of satisfying the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, which the Board of Directors believes are reasonable,
customary and limited in number and scope, and which, in the case of the conditions related to the absence of Material Adverse
Effect between July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement and Closing of the Merger and the accuracy of 1Life’s representations
and warranties, are, in most circumstances, qualified by a traditional public company “Material Adverse Effect” standard, which
excludes, among other things, any event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect to the extent resulting from or relating
to COVID-19 (and any evolutions or mutations thereof). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”; and
43
Table of Contents
•
Additional Transaction Terms: the additional terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, including:
•
1Life’s right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, prior to the receipt of the 1Life Stockholder Approval, to
respond to and negotiate unsolicited Acquisition Proposals made after the date of the Merger Agreement. For more information,
please see of the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’
Recommendation; Adverse Recommendation Change”;
•
1Life’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal or make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, in each case, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and paying Amazon the 1Life Termination Fee
of $136,000,000;
•
the fact that the Board of Directors believed that the 1Life Termination Fee of $136,000,000, which is approximately 3.5% of 1Life’s
equity value, is reasonable, within market averages for such fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of, or a
substantial impediment to, a third party making an Acquisition Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Adverse
Recommendation Change”;
•
the fact that, in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger in certain circumstances
relating to the failure of antitrust clearances to be obtained, Amazon will be required to pay 1Life the Amazon Termination Fee of
$195,000,000, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
1Life’s right to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that the consummation of the Merger is subject to the approval of 1Life stockholders, who will have the opportunity to adopt
or reject the Merger Agreement;
•
the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to 1Life’s stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and exercise, and do not effectively waive, withdraw,
fail to perfect or otherwise lose, their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, which provides those eligible stockholders with
an opportunity to seek an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the “fair value” of their shares of 1Life common stock
(exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on
the amount determined to be fair value, if any), which may be determined by the court to be more than, less than, or the same as the
Merger Consideration;
•
the initial outside date of July 20, 2023, with two six-month automatic extensions in certain circumstances as set forth in the Merger
Agreement relating to the failure of antitrust clearances to be obtained, allowing for time that the Board of Directors believed to be
sufficient to complete the Merger;
•
the fact that that, taken as a whole, the comprehensive terms of the Merger Agreement, including the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and termination rights and fees of the parties, as finally negotiated are reasonable and customary; and
•
the fact the Board of Directors and 1Life’s management, in coordination with 1Life’s independent legal and financial advisors,
negotiated with Amazon on an arm’s-length basis, including with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement.
The Board of Directors also assessed 1Life’s prospects for substantially increasing stockholder value as a standalone company in excess of the Merger
Consideration, given the risks and uncertainties in 1Life’s business, including the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):
•
the various execution and other risks to achieving 1Life’s long-term operating plan and related uncertainties, including those described
below;
44
Table of Contents
•
the risks inherent in operating 1Life’s business in a heavily regulated and competitive industry that is closely scrutinized by federal, state
and local authorities;
•
the uncertainty of the outcome of healthcare reform legislation, including regulations that could impact payments for medical services;
•
the potential regulatory scrutiny of 1Life’s health network partnerships that could adversely impact 1Life’s business and operations, and the
risks related to 1Life’s reliance on third party relationships, including health network providers and enterprise clients, to continue to grow its
business;
•
the changes in the nature or operations of 1Life’s enterprise clients, including changes to employee benefit programs or workforce
reductions in response to uncertain economic conditions, and the potential adverse impact on 1Life’s ability to enroll new and retain
existing patients;
•
the risks related to 1Life’s reliance on patient visits as a substantial portion of 1Life’s net revenue;
•
the changes in the health insurance industry, including the challenges associated with a potential shift away from employer-sponsored
health plans toward employee self-insurance;
•
the risks inherent in managing the growth of a business that requires significant capital expenditures, such as the cost of leasing medical
office space and acquiring medical equipment to maintain and open medical offices, and the challenges forecasting locations to attract the
optimal number of patients and the related costs associated with relocating or shutting down under performing medical offices;
•
the challenges inherent in operating as a publicly traded company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance,
including the challenge of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects;
•
risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants, and the potential impact of such risks and
uncertainties on a standalone strategy and the trading price of common stock, including the uncertainty related to the spread of the COVID-
19 pandemic and the potential consequences of the pandemic on the financial markets and 1Life’s current and future business and
operations, which could include the closure of some or all medical offices for physical visits, delays in interactions with and responses from
governmental authorities, and disruptions in the operations of the business and other third parties upon whom 1Life relies; and
•
the current state of the U.S. and global economies, including the recent downward trend in the financial markets, increased volatility
resulting from escalating political and global trade tensions, and the current and potential impact of such factors in both the near term and
long term on the industry, all of which risks are increased by the COVID-19 pandemic and may remain present following the resolution of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The Board of Directors also took into consideration that as a standalone company 1Life would need to seek significant additional funding through future
equity and/or debt financings, and any such fundraising could have a highly dilutive effect on 1Life’s existing stockholders, could require 1Life to enter
into restrictive covenants, might only be available on unfavorable terms given the recent downward trend in the financial markets, or might not be
available at all.
The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following (which are not listed in any
relative order of importance):
•
the fact that 1Life would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and stockholders would no longer participate in any
future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any potential future appreciation in value of 1Life;
•
the fact that the potential outside date is as late as July 22, 2024 (if extended) and the 1Life stockholders could be asked to vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement well in advance of the completion of the Transactions;
45
Table of Contents
•
the risks and costs to 1Life if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner, including (i) the impact that (A) payment of
1Life Termination Fees to Amazon in certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, (B) other significant transaction costs in
connection with the proposed Merger and/or (C) the obligation to repay the interim debt financing could have on 1Life’s cash balances and
ability to service payments under 1Life’s outstanding convertible notes and other outstanding indebtedness at that time, and the fact that
1Life’s options for sources of financing or refinancing could be more limited than if 1Life had not pursued the proposed Merger, (ii) the
diversion of employee attention, (iii) the possible loss of key management or other personnel of 1Life during the pendency of the Merger,
(iv) the impact with respect to potential and existing patients and other third parties that may seek to change or may not enter into business
relationships with 1Life during the pendency of the Merger, and (v) if the Merger does not close, the effect of the resulting public
announcement of termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of 1Life’s common stock;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of 1Life’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that 1Life conduct in
all material respects its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, subject to specific limitations, which may
delay or prevent 1Life from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the
Merger Agreement, 1Life might have pursued;
•
the requirement that 1Life pay Amazon the 1Life Termination Fee of $136,000,000 following termination of the Merger Agreement in certain
circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, including if 1Life terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Adverse Recommendation Change”;
•
the fact that an all-cash transaction would generally be taxable to 1Life’s stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;
•
the fact that, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, 1Life and its representatives are prohibited from
soliciting any third party Acquisition Proposals until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger (many of which are
payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time and effort of 1Life management required to complete the
Merger, which may disrupt 1Life’s business operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
•
the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied or, if
permissible, waived, including:
•
the fact that there can be no assurances that 1Life stockholders will approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that completion of the Merger requires antitrust clearance, which could subject the Merger to delays and risk; and
•
the possibility of the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect with respect to 1Life, the non-continuance of which is a condition to the
Acquiring Parties’ obligation to consummate the Merger;
•
the risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against 1Life or its directors and officers, and potential effects
of outcomes related thereto;
•
the fact that 1Life’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of 1Life’s
stockholders more generally. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of
1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”;

•
other risks and uncertainties of the nature identified in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” and in
1Life’s filings with the SEC, including the risks set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in 1Life’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021 and 1Life’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board of Directors concluded that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions
and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger Agreement and Transactions contemplated thereby were outweighed by the positive factors
and potential benefits associated with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated thereby that supported its determination and
recommendation. Accordingly, the Board of Directors determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated thereby are advisable,
fair to, and in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors
considered by the Board of Directors in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated thereby, and making its recommendation
and determination. The members of the Board of Directors evaluated the various factors listed above, among other things, in light of their knowledge of
the business, financial condition and prospects of 1Life and considered the advice of 1Life’s independent financial and legal advisors. In view of the wide
variety of factors considered by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement, the Transactions and the complexity
of these matters, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons
considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information and reasons described above, individual members of
the Board of Directors each applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors.
The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or
did not support its ultimate determinations. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented,
including thorough discussions with, and questioning of, 1Life management, and its independent legal and financial advisors.
When considering the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
stockholders should be aware that some of 1Life’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition
to, the interests of stockholders more generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent
that they existed at the time, in reaching the determination that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions were fair to and in the best interests of 1Life
and its stockholders, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, in making its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
approval of the Transactions and in directing that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The explanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the section of
this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Financial Projections
1Life does not, as a matter of course, make long-term projections as to future performance available to the public other than generally providing, on a
quarterly basis, estimated ranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current or pending fiscal quarter and year in its
regular earnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with evaluating a potential strategic transaction in March 2022,
47
Table of Contents
1Life senior management created long range projections from 2022 through 2025 and extrapolations from 2026 through 2031 (the “Management Case A”).
In addition, in connection with 1Life’s evaluation of the acquisition of Iora Health, Inc. in the second quarter of 2021, 1Life senior management had
created (i) standalone forecasts for 1Life that were long range projections from 2021 through 2023 and extrapolations from 2024 through 2030 (the “1Life
Case”), (ii) standalone forecasts for Iora based on Iora management long range projections through 2025 and 1Life’s management extrapolations through
2030 and applying 1Life’s assumptions and forecasts of Iora through 2030 (the “Iora Base Case”), and (iii) prospective financial information with respect
to the ability of the combined 1Life and Iora to increase its revenue and reduce its costs and capital expenditures following the consummation of the
merger between 1Life and Iora through 2030 (the “Iora Synergies”), each of (i)-(iii) as set forth in 1Life’s proxy statement/prospectus filed on Form S-4 on
July 6, 2021 (as amended on July 14, 2021, the “Form S-4”). In connection with 1Life’s evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, in March 2022, 1Life
senior management combined the 1Life Case, the Iora Base Case and the Iora Synergies (together, the “2021 Projections”), extrapolated such 2021
Projections through 2031 and updated the 2021 Projections to include 1Life’s actual net operating losses (“NOLs”) and reflect 1Life’s actual tax position
(the 2021 Projections as so combined, extrapolated and updated, “Management Case B”, and together with Management Case A, the “Projections”).
Management Case A, as compared to Management Case B, assumes lower investments in future growth beginning in 2024 due to the impact of the
current economic and financial environment. Management Case A assumed (i) revenue growth rates decrease from 75% in 2022 to 7% in 2031 (as
compared to Management Case B which assumes revenue growth rates decrease from 79% in 2022 to 23% in 2031); and (ii) care margins increase from
20% in 2022 to 33% in 2031 (as compared to Management Case B which assumes care margins increase from 20% in 2022 to 31% in 2031). Both
Management Case A and Management Case B assume a standalone capital raise of $300,000,000 at the end of 2022.
The Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by 1Life senior management with respect to general business, economic, competitive, regulatory
and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond 1Life’s control. In
particular, the Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently
uncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are
unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance that could have an effect on 1Life’s business and its results of operations. The Projections were
developed solely using the information available to 1Life senior management at the time they were created and reflect assumptions as to certain business
decisions that are subject to change. The Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results and business developments. Important factors that may affect actual results or that may
result in the Projections not being achieved include, but are not limited to, regulatory actions at the federal, state and local level, decisions of health
network providers, enterprise clients and existing and potential patients, changes in the health insurance industry, the effect of global economic
conditions, including COVID-19, and other factors described in the section captioned “Forward-looking Statements” in this proxy statement and the risk
factors described in 1Life’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
current reports on Form 8-K. The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with published
guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of
prospective financial information. The Projections cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon
as such.
None of 1Life, the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley, Amazon or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any
representation to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections or the ultimate performance of
1Life relative to the Projections. The inclusion of the summary of the Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or
representation of 1Life, the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley, Amazon or any of their respective
48
Table of Contents
affiliates, advisors or other representatives that the Projections or the information contained therein are material. The inclusion of the summary of the
Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that 1Life or anyone who receives the Projections then considered, or now
considers, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In the view of
1Life’s management, the Projections were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best estimates and judgments available to 1Life’s management at
the time and presented, to the best of 1Life’s management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and 1Life’s expected future financial
performance as of the date such information was prepared. Except as required by applicable law, neither 1Life, the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley,
Amazon, nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update, correct
or otherwise revise the Projections if any or all of them have changed or change. Since the Projections were created, 1Life has made publicly available its
actual results of operations for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. You should review 1Life’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
filed with the SEC on August 3, 2022 for this information. The Projections included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of,
1Life senior management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect
to the accompanying Projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates to the Company’s previously issued financial
statements. It does not extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so.
In light of the foregoing, and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the
Projections. The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding 1Life in
its public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by 1Life senior management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger
and the other Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and therefore the Projections do not give effect to the proposed Merger or any
changes to 1Life’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including any costs incurred in connection with
the proposed Merger. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the proposed Merger to be completed and should
not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
Care Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow (each as defined below) contained in the summary of the Projections set forth below are
each “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial performance or operating measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These
non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be calculated differently than similarly titled
non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they
exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be
considered together with, and not as alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in
the Projections were relied on by Morgan Stanley for the purposes of its fairness opinion and by the Board of Directors in connection with its
consideration of a potential strategic transaction. The SEC rules, which otherwise would require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to the
most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in
connection with a proposed business combination transaction, such as the Transactions, if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy
statement. In addition, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures were not provided
to or relied upon by the Board of Directors or Morgan Stanley in connection with the Transactions. Accordingly, 1Life has not provided reconciliations of
the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
The information and tables set forth below is included solely to give 1Life stockholders access to certain of the financial and operating projections that
were made available to the Board of Directors and Morgan Stanley and are not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder’s
decision to vote with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement or for any other purpose.

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
1Life retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential sale of 1Life and to provide
financial advice and assistance and, upon the request of the 1Llife, to
50
Table of Contents
render a financial opinion in each case in connection therewith. 1Life selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s
qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in 1Life’s industry. On July 20, 2022, Morgan Stanley
rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of that date, and based upon and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by
Morgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of 1Life’s common
stock (other than the Excluded Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board of Directors, dated July 20, 2022, is attached as Annex B and is
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion.
Stockholders of 1Life are urged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Board of
Directors and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of 1Life’s common
stock (other than the Excluded Shares). Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and the opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the
Merger Agreement or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into
or amended in connection therewith. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternatives
available to 1Life, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not constitute an opinion or
recommendation as to how the stockholders of 1Life should vote at the Special Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger. The summary of
Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of 1Life;
•
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning 1Life;
•
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of 1Life;
•
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of 1Life with senior executives of 1Life;
•
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for 1Life’s common stock;
•
compared the financial performance of 1Life and the prices and trading activity of 1Life’s common stock with that of certain other publicly-
traded companies comparable with 1Life and their securities;
•
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
•
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of 1Life and Amazon and their financial and legal advisors;
•
reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and
•
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by 1Life, and formed a substantial basis for Morgan Stanley’s
opinion. With respect
51
Table of Contents
to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of 1Life of the future financial performance of 1Life. Morgan Stanley’s opinion expressed no view as to such financial
projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that
Amazon will have sufficient immediately available funds to consummate the Merger. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all
the necessary or requested governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Merger. Morgan Stanley
is not a legal, tax, or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of
1Life and its legal, tax, or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the
fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of 1Life’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the
Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of common stock in the Merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities of 1Life, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not
address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternatives available to 1Life, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved
or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to Morgan Stanley as of July 20, 2022. Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in
preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion letter, dated as of July 20, 2022, to the Board of Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s
opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below
must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was directed by the Board of Directors
to rely upon, among other matters, the Projections, which are more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Recommendations of
the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger – Financial Projections.” In accordance with direction from the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley
utilized the Projections in its financial analyses described below.
Public Trading Benchmarks Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading benchmarks analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar
companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for 1Life with comparable publicly available
consensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share similar
business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue
growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to herein as the
“comparable companies”).
52
Table of Contents
The comparable companies were split into two groups for the purposes of this analysis: (i) “Medicare Advantage Focused Primary Care” and (ii) “Tech-
Enabled Healthcare Services.”
Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, using Wall Street research consensus estimates and publicly disclosed
information for the comparable companies and 1Life. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley calculated “aggregate value” as a company’s fully
diluted equity value, per the treasury stock method and using the market price per share as of July 1, 2022 (the last day prior to media reports on a
possible sale of 1Life) or July 19, 2022, plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents drawn from the most recently publicly reported figures for such
amounts. The trading multiples that were calculated using the market data as of July 1, 2022 are referred to as the “unaffected multiples.” The trading
multiples that were calculated using the market data as of July 19, 2022 are referred to as the “July 19 multiples.” The July 19 multiples were calculated for
reference only, and were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s fairness analysis with respect to its opinion, due to Morgan Stanley’s determination,
using its professional judgement and experience, that media reports of potential acquisitions in the sector affected trading outcomes for 1Life and the
comparable companies after July 1. The July 19 multiples are described more fully in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Opinion of Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC–Other Information–Public Trading Benchmarks–July 19 Multiples.”
The unaffected multiples represented by the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for 1Life, the “Medicare
Advantage Focused Primary Care” comparable companies and the “Tech-Enabled Healthcare Services” comparable companies are set forth below:

Based on its analysis of the unaffected multiples for 1Life and each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment
and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples of 1.5x-2.5x, for calendar year 2022, and
1.0x-2.0x for calendar year 2023, for use with each of Management Case A and Management Case B. Morgan Stanley then applied these ranges of
multiples to the estimated relevant revenue metric for 1Life to calculate a range of implied aggregate values. Morgan Stanley then added the net cash of
1Life, as provided by the management of 1Life, from this range of aggregate values to obtain a range of implied equity values. Morgan Stanley then
divided the range of implied equity values by the number of outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis as of July 19, 2022, as provided
by the management of 1Life, to obtain a range of implied values per share, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, as set forth below:

No company utilized in this analysis is identical to 1Life. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
1Life’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on 1Life’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of 1Life and the industry, and in the financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis for Management Case A and Management Case B, which is designed to provide insight
into the potential future equity value of a company as a function of such company’s estimated future financial performance. The resulting future equity
value is subsequently discounted at a rate based upon 1Life’s cost of equity in order to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value. In connection
with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of 1Life’s common stock on a standalone basis for
Management Case A and Management Case B.
To calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized the revenue estimates from Management Case A and Management
Case B for the next 12 months from year-end 2024. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley then applied
a range of next twelve month (“NTM”) multiples of 1.50x-2.50x to this revenue estimate to determine a range of implied aggregate values of 1Life as of
year-end 2024. Morgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied equity values as of such date by reducing the range of aggregate values by the
estimated net debt of 1Life as of such date, as provided by the management of 1Life, assuming a future projected common equity issuance, per the
direction of the management of 1Life. Morgan Stanley then divided this range of implied equity values by the number of fully diluted common shares as
of such date, as provided by the management of 1Life, including the dilutive impact resulting from a future projected common equity issuance, to derive a
range of implied values per share as of such date. Morgan Stanley then discounted this range of per share values to June 30, 2022, at a discount rate of
14.8%, which rate was selected by Morgan Stanley based on 1Life’s estimated cost of equity (estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and
based on its professional judgement and experience) to determine a range of implied discounted equity values per share, each rounded to the nearest

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis for Management Case A and Management Case B, which is designed to provide an implied
value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a
range of fully diluted equity values per share as of June 30, 2022 based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from
Management Case A and Management Case B for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows projected to be generated by 1Life based on estimates in each of Management
Case A and Management Case B. These unlevered free cash flows were calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less
(1) a portion of stock-based compensation expense, per the direction of the management of 1Life, (2) taxes (assuming effective rate of 25.0% offset by
federal and state net operating losses, as provided by the management of 1Life), (3) capital expenditures and (4) plus or minus changes in net working
capital, which such estimated unlevered free cash flow, in each case, was reviewed and approved by the management of 1Life for Morgan Stanley’s use.
Terminal values were calculated using a perpetual growth rate ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%, with such rates selected upon the application of Morgan
Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The unlevered free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to present values as of June 30, 2022,
using a midyear convention, at a discount rate ranging from 12.9% to 14.0%, which discount rates were selected upon the application of Morgan
Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of 1Life’s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the
capital asset pricing model. The resulting range of implied aggregate values were then increased by the net cash of 1Life as of June 30, 2022, as provided
by the management of 1Life, and the present value of a future projected common equity issuance, per the direction of the management of 1Life, to derive a
range of implied equity values. Morgan Stanley then divided the implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares, as of July 19, 2020 as
provided by the management of 1Life, including the dilutive impact resulting from a future projected common equity issuance, to derive a range of implied
values per share, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, as set forth below:

Precedent Transactions – Premiums Paid Analysis
Morgan Stanley considered, based on publicly available transaction information, transactions with global public targets larger than $1 billion in aggregate
value, paid in all-cash consideration, since 1996 and announced on or before June 30, 2022. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted (i) the
distribution of the mean of percentage premiums paid over unaffected stock price, which was defined as the stock price four weeks prior to the earliest
date of the deal announcement, announcement of a competing bid, and market rumors and (ii) the annual mean of percentage premiums paid over
unaffected stock price, which was defined as stock price four weeks prior to the earliest date of the deal announcement, announcement of a competing
bid, and market rumors. Morgan Stanley noted a 27-year average premium of 40.1%.
Based on its analysis of the premia for these transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley
selected a representative range of premia of 40.0%-80.0% and applied such range to 1Life’s closing share price on July 1, 2022, the last day prior to media
reports on a possible sale of 1Life, which resulted in an implied price range per share of $11.59 to $14.90.
No company or transaction utilized in the premiums paid analysis is identical to 1Life or the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan
Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
55
Table of Contents
performance, general business, market and financial conditions and other factors beyond the control of 1Life, such as the impact of competition on the
business of 1Life or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition of 1Life or the
industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and equity value of
the transactions to which they are being compared. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean and median) is not in itself a meaningful method
of using precedent transaction data.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but which
were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following information described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC—Other Information—Public Trading Benchmarks—July 19 Multiples,” “Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
—Other Information—Historic Trading Range,” and “Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC—Other Information—Broker Price Targets.”
Public Trading Benchmarks – July 19 Multiples
Morgan Stanley conducted a public trading benchmarks analysis, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Opinion of
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC—Public Trading Benchmarks Analysis.” For reference only, and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley
derived the July 19 multiples from the aggregate values of 1Life and the comparable companies as calculated using the fully diluted equity values with the
market price per share as of July 19. The July 19 multiples were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion due
to Morgan Stanley’s determination, using its professional judgement and experience, that media reports of potential acquisitions in the sector affected
trading outcomes for 1Life and the comparable companies after July 1.
The July 19 multiples represented by the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for 1Life, the “Medicare

Historical Trading Range
For reference only, and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the historic trading range of 1Life’s common stock for the
52-week period ending July 19, 2022, and noted low and high per
56
Table of Contents
share closing prices of $6.24 on May 11, 2022 and $29.79 on August 5, 2021. Morgan Stanley also reviewed the trading range of 1Life’s common stock for
the 30- and 60- day periods ending July 1, 2022, the last day prior to media reports on a possible sale of 1Life, and noted a volume-weighted average price
per share of $8.38 and $8.25, respectively.
Broker Price Targets
For reference only, and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed and analyzed future public market trading price targets for
1Life’s common stock that were prepared and published by equity research analysts on or before July 1, 2022, the last day prior to media reports on a
possible sale of 1Life. These one-year forward targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the future public market trading price of 1Life’s common stock.
The range of undiscounted analyst price targets was $9.00 to $17.00 per share of common stock as of July 1, 2022. Morgan Stanley discounted the range
of analyst price targets by 12 months, at a discount rate of 14.8%, which rate was selected by Morgan Stanley based on 1Life’s estimated cost of equity
(estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience), to arrive at an implied
range of equity values, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $7.75 to $14.75 per share of common stock as of July 1, 2022.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for 1Life common
stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of 1Life and future financial market conditions.
General
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a
whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s
view of the actual value of 1Life.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of 1Life. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on
the business of 1Life and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of 1Life and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily
indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of common stock (other than the Excluded Shares), and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to the
Board of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which common stock might actually trade.
The value of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of common stock was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between 1Life
and Amazon and was approved by the Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to 1Life during these negotiations but did not,
however, recommend
57
Table of Contents
any specific consideration to 1Life or the Board of Directors, nor opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for
the Merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternatives available to 1Life, or
whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion
or a recommendation as to how stockholders of 1Life should vote at the Special Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors in
deciding to approve the execution, delivery and performance by 1Life of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Consequently, the analyses as described
above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the Merger Consideration or of whether the Board
of Directors would have been willing to agree to different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley
investment banking and other professionals in accordance with its customary practice.
1Life retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm
engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities
underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment
banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or
manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own
account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Amazon, 1Life, or any other company, or any currency or commodity,
that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided 1Life financial advisory services and the Board of Directors with a fairness opinion,
described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the Merger, and 1Life has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a
fee of approximately $49 million for its services, $4 million of which was paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to
this proxy statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. 1Life has also agreed to reimburse
Morgan Stanley for its reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket fees of outside counsel and
other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, 1Life has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its
and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against
certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws, including arising out of or in connection with litigation and other actions relating to Morgan Stanley’s
engagement.
During the two years preceding the date of delivery of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates provided financing services to
Amazon and have received fees of approximately $5-15 million in connection with such services, and financial advisory and financing services to 1Life
and have received fees of approximately $20-40 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley is currently a lender to Amazon, unrelated to
the Merger. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Amazon.com, 1Life and their respective affiliates in the
future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that some of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
stockholders more generally, as
58
Table of Contents
more fully described below. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that they existed at
the time, in reaching the determination that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions were fair to and in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders,
in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, in making their recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
Transactions and in directing that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders. For more information, please see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Arrangements with Amazon
In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement and contingent upon Closing of the Merger, Mr. Rubin has entered into a letter agreement with
Amazon pursuant to which Mr. Rubin will serve as CEO, One Medical, following Closing. Under the letter agreement, Mr. Rubin will be entitled to an
annual base salary of $350,000. Additionally, effective as of the Closing Date, Mr. Rubin is eligible for a sign-on payment in the aggregate amount of

remaining $1,200,000 will be payable in equal pay period installments during the one-year period following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, in
each case, subject to continued employment with the Amazon through each such payment date.
Under the terms of the letter agreement, following the Closing, subject to approval by the Board of Directors of Amazon, Mr. Rubin will be granted an
award of Amazon restricted stock units (which we refer to as an “Amazon New Hire RSU Award”) with a value of $11,275,000 (the number of restricted
stock units will be calculated based on the 30-trading-day trailing average closing price of Amazon common stock on the last trading day of the week
prior to the Closing Date). The Amazon New Hire RSU Award will vest on the following schedule, subject to Mr. Rubin’s continued employment through
each applicable vesting date:
•
9.76% will vest on the 15th day of the month in which the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date occurs,

23.50% will vest in equal installments on the 15th day of the month in which each of the 51-month, 54-month, 57-month and 60-month
anniversaries of the Closing Date occur.
Additionally, following the Closing, subject to approval by the Board of Directors of Amazon, Mr. Rubin will be granted an award of Amazon restricted
stock units (which we refer to as an “Amazon Deal RSU Award”) with a value of $15,000,000 (the number of restricted stock units will be calculated based
on the 30-trading-day trailing average closing price of Amazon common stock on the last trading day of the week prior to the Closing Date). The Amazon
Deal RSU Award will vest on the following schedule, subject to Mr. Rubin’s continued employment through each applicable vesting date:
•
6.7% on the 15th day of the month following the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
•
13.75% on the 15th day of the month following the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
•
35% on the 15th day of the month following the third anniversary of the Closing Date, and
•
44.55% on the 15th day of the month following the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date.

Table of Contents
The letter agreement also provides that, effective as of the Closing Date, the Rubin Employment Agreement (as defined below under the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control—Rubin Employment Agreement”) is amended
such that (i) Mr. Rubin waives any right he may have to terminate his employment on or following the Closing Date for Good Reason (as defined in the
Rubin Employment Agreement) and Mr. Rubin will not be entitled to any severance or other termination benefits (including any acceleration of vesting or
continued vesting of any equity-based awards) in the event Mr. Rubin terminates his employment for any reason on or following the Closing Date, (ii) the
Amazon New Hire RSU Award, the Amazon Deal RSU Award and any other equity-based awards granted to him by Amazon following the Closing Date
will not be subject to accelerated vesting or continuing vesting upon termination of his employment for any reason and (iii) any equity-based awards
granted to him by 1Life between July 20, 2022 and the Closing Date that remain unvested as of the Closing Date will be forfeited for no consideration,
effective as of the Closing Date. In the event Mr. Rubin’s employment is terminated by Amazon without Cause (as defined below) on or following the
Closing Date, he will be eligible to receive the severance and other termination benefits under the Rubin Employment Agreement.
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers other than Mr. Rubin has entered into any agreement with Amazon or any of its
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior
to and following the Closing, however, certain of our executive officers may have discussions, and following the Closing, may enter into agreements with,
Amazon or Merger Sub, their subsidiaries or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of,
the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.",48,67

Under the Merger Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will, and Amazon will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of 1Life and the 1Life subsidiaries under (i)
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of 1Life or 1Life subsidiary in effect as of July 20, 2022, the date of the
Merger Agreement, and (ii) any and all indemnification agreements between 1Life or any 1Life subsidiary and any of their respective present or former
directors and officers (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), and such indemnification agreements will survive the Merger and will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Parties, except, in each case, to the
extent required by applicable law. In addition, except to the extent required by applicable law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of 1Life in effect as of July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, and any
claim made pursuant to such rights within such six (6) year period will continue to be subject to the indemnification provisions of the Merger Agreement
until disposition of such claim.
Additionally, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts incurred by that Indemnified Party in accordance with the Terms of the Merger Agreement.
Prior to the Effective Time, 1Life will obtain, effective at the Effective Time, “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in amount and scope (including with respect to coverage and deductibles) at least
as favorable as 1Life’s existing policies as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for claims arising from facts or events that
60Table of Contents
occurred on or prior to the Effective Time. If for any reason 1Life fails to obtain a “tail” insurance policy as of the Effective Time, Amazon will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies
maintained by 1Life as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Additionally, the Surviving Corporation may substitute policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are substantially similar with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; but that in no event
will 1Life or the Surviving Corporation, be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current aggregate annual premiums paid by
1Life for such insurance. In the event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies, Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation
to obtain policies that provide as much coverage as is reasonably possible under substantially similar policies for such maximum annual amount in
aggregate annual premiums.

$883,369. The 1Life RSUs and 1Life Options held by 1Life’s non-employee directors and the 1Life Options and Life RSUs held by 1Life’s executive officers
immediately before the Effective Time will be treated as described below.
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time each:
(i)
1Life Option with an exercise price per share of common stock that is less than the Merger Consideration that is vested or that accelerates
vesting pursuant to its terms at the Effective Time (with any market or performance conditions determined in accordance with the applicable
award agreement), and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such 1Life
Option and (2) the number of shares then subject to such 1Life Option, less any applicable tax withholdings;
(ii)
1Life Option with an exercise price per share of common stock that is less than the Merger Consideration that is unvested and is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product
of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such 1Life Option and (2) the number of shares
then subject to such 1Life Option, which will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to such unvested
1Life Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and will vest in installments over the remainder of the vesting schedule of such 1Life
Option;
(iii)
1Life Option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share of common stock that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration will be cancelled without consideration;
(iv)
1Life RSU that is vested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the number of shares then subject to such 1Life
RSU, less any applicable tax withholdings;
(v)
1Life RSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the number of shares then subject to such 1Life RSU, and such
cash-based awards will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the 1Life RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time and will vest in installments over the remainder of the vesting schedule applicable to the 1Life RSU; and

(vi)
1Life Phantom Award will remain outstanding at the Effective Time and continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as
applicable to such 1Life Phantom Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration
—Treatment of 1Life Options, 1Life RSUs, and 1Life Phantom Awards.”
Treatment of 1Life ESPP
The Merger Agreement generally provides that after July 20, 2022, no new offering periods will begin under the 1Life ESPP, no 1Life employee may
become a new participant in the 1Life ESPP and no 1Life ESPP participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election.
The current purchase period will terminate at the earlier of (1) the scheduled purchase date for the current purchase period, which is November 15, 2022
and (2) immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each participant’s accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase shares of common stock on
such purchase date in accordance with the terms of the 1Life ESPP. Contingent on closing of the Merger, the 1Life ESPP will terminate effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. While two of our executive officers in the 1Life ESPP, none of our executive officers have accumulated payroll
deductions under the 1Life ESPP for the offering period that commenced on May 16, 2022. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Treatment of Purchase Rights under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.”",67,69

Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan
In January 2020, the Board of Directors adopted an Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan (the “Executive Severance and Change in Control
Plan”) that provides severance benefits to each of our executive officers, including our named executive officers (“NEOs”), other than Mr. Rubin.
Under the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, upon an involuntary termination without cause or resignation for good reason, participants
in the plan will be entitled to receive (i) a cash payment equal to twelve months’ base salary payable in equal installments in accordance with our regular
payroll schedule, and (ii) continuation of health insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”)
for up to twelve months following such resignation or termination date. In addition, upon an involuntary termination without cause or resignation for
good reason in connection at or within twelve months following a Change of Control (as defined in the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan
and which includes the Merger), participants will be entitled to receive (i) a cash payment equal to twelve months’ base salary payable in monthly
installments in accordance with our regular payroll schedule, (ii) a cash payment for the participant’s full performance-based incentive at the participant’s
target achievement level for the applicable year under the 1Life Executive Annual Incentive Plan, (iii) continuation of health insurance under COBRA for
up to twelve months following such resignation or termination date, and (iv) acceleration of all equity awards outstanding on the resignation or
termination date. All such severance benefits are subject to the participant’s execution and nonrevocation of a general release of all known and unknown
claims in favor of 1Life or its acquirer or successor in substantially the form provided in the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan.
The benefits provided under the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan supersede any similar severance benefits described in a participant’s
offer letter or employment agreement (other than for Mr. Rubin, as noted below).
For the purposes of the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, “cause” generally means termination of a participant’s service for one or more
of the following reasons: (1) the participant’s indictment or
62Table of Contents
conviction of any felony or any crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (2) the
participant’s refusal to abide by or comply with any reasonable, lawful directives of the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors; (3) the
participant’s willful dishonesty, fraud, or material misconduct with respect to the business or affairs of 1Life or its acquiror or successor in interest; (4)
intentional, material violation of any contract or agreement with 1Life or of any statutory duty owed to 1Life or its acquiror or successor; or (5) the
participant’s conduct by which the participant demonstrates gross unfitness to serve.
“Good Reason” shall mean if one of the following events occurs without the participant’s written consent: (i) a material reduction in the amount of
aggregate cash compensation which the participant has the opportunity to earn, or failure by 1Life to pay such compensation; (ii) the participant is
required by 1Life to relocate the participant’s primary work location by more than 25 miles; (iii) a material adverse reduction in the participant’s duties,
authority or responsibilities, including the participant’s reporting responsibilities, but excluding any change in title that does not represent a material
adverse reduction in the participant’s duties, authority or responsibilities as existed immediately prior to such change in title and (iv) a material breach by
1Life under any written agreement between the participant and 1Life.
For purposes of clause (iii) above, for all other officers, if 1Life is operated as a separate subsidiary or business unit following a Change of Control, such
officers will be deemed to have suffered a material reduction in duties, authority or responsibilities if such duties, authority or responsibilities, including
reporting responsibilities, with respect to such subsidiary or separate business unit are materially changed following such Change of Control. In order to
effect a Resignation for Good Reason, the participant must notify the Board of Directors within 30 days after the first occurrence of the event described
above, 1Life must fail to cure such event within 30 days after receiving written notice, and the participant’s resignation date must be no later than 60 days
after the expiration of 1Life’s cure period. For the 1Life RSUs retention awards granted to each of our current named executive officers as described under
the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination at or Following
Change in Control—Retention Award RSU Grants” below, “Good Reason” is defined in the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, except that
for this specific grant only changes in employee roles and reporting chain naturally resulting from the consummation of the proposed transaction would
not automatically give rise to “Good Reason.” For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control—Retention Award RSU Grants.”
The aggregate amount of cash severance and the aggregate value of continued health and welfare coverage that would be paid to our currently employed
executive officers, in connection with a qualifying termination under the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan is $4,127,177.
Rubin Employment Agreement
Under Mr. Rubin’s employment agreement with 1Life, dated as of June 27, 2017, as amended January 17, 2020 (the “Rubin Employment Agreement”), as
modified by his letter agreement with Amazon, if Mr. Rubin is terminated without Cause (as defined below) within three months prior to or 12 months
following a change in control, then, subject to Mr. Rubin executing and not revoking a general release of all claims, he will be entitled to (i) a lump sum
cash payment equal to 24 months of his annual base salary, (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to his full performance-based cash incentive at his target
achievement level for the applicable year under the Annual Incentive Plan, (iii) continuation of health insurance coverage under COBRA for up to 24
months following termination or resignation and (iv) acceleration of all equity awards outstanding on the resignation or termination date (excluding any
equity awards granted by 1Life between July 20, 2022 and the Closing Date (which would be forfeited to the extent unvested as of the Closing Date as
described under “Arrangements with Amazon” above) and any Amazon equity awards granted after the Closing Date).
For purposes of the Rubin Employment Agreement, “Cause” means (i) Mr. Rubin’s conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any felony or a
crime of moral turpitude; (ii) Mr. Rubin’s willful and continued
63
Table of Contents
failure or refusal to: (a) follow lawful and reasonable policies and regulations of 1Life or its affiliates; or (b) to perform the assigned duties of his
employment with 1Life or its affiliates; (iii) unprofessional, unethical, immoral or fraudulent conduct by Mr. Rubin that is materially detrimental to the
reputation, character and standing of 1Life or any affiliate; or (iv) Mr. Rubin’s material breach of the Rubin Employment Agreement, the Employee
Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement by and between 1Life and Mr. Rubin Agreement, or any written 1Life agreement or
policies so long as, in any case, with respect to items (ii)-(iv) above, (x) 1Life has provided notice to Mr. Rubin setting forth in reasonable detail the
specific conduct of Mr. Rubin that constitutes Cause within thirty (30) days of the date 1Life first becomes aware of its existence, (y) Mr. Rubin has failed
to cure such conduct (if such conduct is capable of being cured) within thirty (30) days following the date of receipt of such notice, and (z) 1Life has
terminated Mr. Rubin’s employment within thirty (30) days following such failure to cure. The letter agreement with Amazon also provides that, effective
as of the Closing Date, the Rubin Employment Agreement is amended such that Mr. Rubin waives any right he may have to receive severance benefits
upon a termination of his employment on or following the Closing Date for Good Reason (as defined in the Rubin Employment Agreement). For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Arrangements with Amazon.”
Retention Award RSU Grants
Our Compensation Committee has approved, and we have granted, the following retention awards in consultation with Amazon: (i) on August 8, 2022, we
granted retention awards in the form of 1Life RSUs to our current named executive officers (other than Mr. Rubin), and (ii) on August 12, 2022, we granted
a retention award in the form of 1Life RSUs to Mr. Rubin (collectively with the retention awards granted to the other named executive officers, the
“Retention 1Life RSUs”). The grants had the following grant date values: $10,000,000 for Mr. Rubin; $4,000,000 for Mr. Thaler; $2,000,000 for Mr. Diamond
and $4,000,000 for Ms. Mango, resulting in 583,090 shares of common stock underlying the RSUs for Mr. Rubin, 237,529 shares of common stock
underlying the RSUs for Mr. Thaler, 118,764 shares of common stock underlying the RSUs for Mr. Diamond and 237,529 shares of common stock
underlying the RSUs for Ms. Mango. Such Retention 1Life RSUs will vest based on continued service over four (4) years, with fifty percent (50%) of the
shares subject to the Retention 1Life RSUs vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date, twenty percent (20%) vesting on the second anniversary of
the grant date, fifteen percent (15%) on the third anniversary of the grant date and fifteen percent (15%) vesting on the fourth anniversary of the grant. In
the case of the Retention 1Life RSUs granted to our current named executive officers (other than Mr. Rubin), at the Effective Time, such Retention 1Life
RSUs will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the (1) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (2) the number of shares then
subject to such Retention 1Life RSU on the same terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) at the Effective Time. Each such cash award will
vest in full upon a “Qualifying Termination,” which includes a termination without “Cause” and a resignation for Good Reason (each as defined in the
Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, except that for this specific grant only changes in employee roles and reporting chain naturally resulting
from the consummation of the proposed transaction would not automatically give rise to “Good Reason”) at any time on or after the Closing Date, as
described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control.’’ In the
case of the Retention 1Life RSUs granted to Mr. Rubin, any 1Life RSUs that remain unvested as of the Closing Date will be forfeited for no consideration
in accordance with Mr. Rubin’s letter agreement with Amazon. Any vested Retention 1Life RSUs granted to Mr. Rubin will be treated as other vested
1Life RSUs at the Closing Date and will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the (1) the Merger Consideration,
multiplied by (2) the number of shares then subject to such Retention 1Life RSUs, less any applicable tax withholdings. In addition, Mr. Rubin’s Retention
1Life RSUs will accelerate and vest in full in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date by Amazon.
Quantification of Potential Payments to Certain 1Life Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger that will
or may become payable to 1Life’s named executive officers in
64
Table of Contents
connection with the Merger. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Payments Upon Termination
at or Following Change in Control” for further information regarding certain elements of this compensation.
The table below assumes that:
•
the Closing occurs on August 8, 2022, (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure);
•
the number of unvested 1Life equity awards held by the named executive officers is as of August 8, 2022, the latest practicable date to
determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and excludes any additional grants that may occur following such date;
•
pursuant to applicable proxy disclosure rules, the value of the equity award acceleration below is calculated based on the number of shares
covered by the applicable 1Life Options and 1Life RSUs that are accelerating multiplied by $18.00 per share (less the applicable exercise
price per share in the case of 1Life Options);
•
all 1Life Options held by each named executive officer as of August 8, 2022, remain unexercised as of the Closing;
•
the number of Retention 1Life RSUs granted on August 8, 2022 was determined by dividing the approved grant date value for each
Retention 1Life RSU by $16.84 (the closing price of 1Life common stock on Nasdaq on August 8, 2022);
•
the employment of each named executive officer will be terminated immediately following the Closing or otherwise impacted in a manner
entitling the named executive officer to receive the severance benefits described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control”;
•
the named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus are those in effect as of the date of this filing; and
•
other than for Mr. Rubin (whose letter agreement is described under “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers—
Arrangements with Amazon”), no named executive officer enters into a new agreement or is otherwise legally entitled to, before the
Effective Time, additional compensation or benefits.
The amounts shown in the table below do not include the value of payments or benefits that would have been earned, or any amounts associated with
equity awards that would vest pursuant to their terms, on or prior to Closing, or the value of payments or benefits that are not based on or otherwise
related to the Merger.
In addition to the assumptions described in the preceding paragraph, the amounts set forth in the table below are based on certain other assumptions
that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. The assumptions based upon which we have estimated the amounts in the table below
may or may not actually occur. Accordingly, the ultimate amounts to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ
from the amounts set forth below. For purposes of the footnotes to the table below, “single trigger” refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of
Closing, and “double trigger” refers to benefits that require two (2) conditions, which are Closing and a qualifying termination. For more information, see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers” below for a quantification of the
amounts that the named executive officers will receive in respect of vested equity awards at the Effective Time.

The amounts listed in this column for each named executive officer represent the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which each of Mr.
Rubin and the other named executive officers may become entitled to under the Rubin Employment Agreement (as amended by his letter agreement
described in “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers—Arrangements with Amazon”) and the Executive Severance and
Change in Control Plan, respectively, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Payments Upon
Termination at or Following Change in Control.” To be eligible for such “double-trigger” cash severance benefits, in connection with or within the
twelve months following a “change in control” (or in the case of Mr. Rubin, during the three months prior to or the twelve months following a
“change in control”), the named executive officer must be terminated by 1Life without “cause” or, for named executive officers other than Mr.
Rubin, the named executive officer must resign for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan
and the Rubin Employment Agreement, as amended by his letter agreement described in “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive
Officers—Arrangements with Amazon, and as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Payments Upon
Termination at or Following Change in Control”) (for the purposes of the table above, a “Qualifying CIC Termination”). As described above in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers—Arrangements with Amazon,” Mr.
Rubin’s base salary effective as of the Closing Date will be $350,000, and his total cash severance as of the Closing Date upon a termination without
“cause” will be $1,085,000. In the event Mr. Rubin’s employment is terminated by 1Life or Amazon without Cause during the three months prior to
or the twelve months following the Closing, any outstanding awards granted to Mr. Rubin by 1Life prior to July 20, 2022 will accelerate vesting in
full.
(2)
For each named executive officer, the amount listed in this column represents the vesting acceleration to which he or she may become entitled upon
a Qualifying CIC Termination at the Effective Time, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control” and “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Treatment of 1Life Options, 1Life RSUs and 1Life Phantom Awards” (which are “double trigger” benefits). To be eligible for “double-
trigger” benefits, the named executive officer must incur a Qualifying CIC Termination. As described in “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors
and Executive Officers—Arrangements with Amazon,” Mr. Rubin will not be entitled to any acceleration or continued vesting of any equity-based
awards in the event he resigns from his employment for any reason, and any equity awards granted to him by Amazon (including the Amazon New
Hire RSU Award and the Amazon Deal RSU Award) will not be subject to accelerated vesting or continued vesting upon termination of his
employment for any reason. Any equity-based awards granted to Mr. Rubin by 1Life between July 20, 2022 and the Closing Date that remain
unvested as of the Closing Date will be forfeited for no consideration, effective as of the Closing Date. As described under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination at or
Following Change in Control—Retention Award RSU Grants,” the named executive officers (other than Mr. Rubin) were granted retention awards in
the form of 1Life RSUs on August 8, 2022, with the following grant date values: $4,000,000 for Mr. Thaler; $2,000,000 for Mr. Diamond and $4,000,000
for Ms. Mango. For such Retention 1Life RSUs “Good Reason” is as defined in the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, except that for
this specific grant only changes in employee roles and reporting chain naturally resulting from the consummation of the proposed transaction

would not automatically give rise to “Good Reason.” Amounts listed do not include the Retention 1Life RSUs granted to Mr. Rubin on August 12,
2022 because unvested amounts are forfeited at the Effective Time. Details of the single-trigger and double-trigger payments that would be received
in connection with outstanding unvested equity awards are shown in the following supplementary table:

The amounts listed in this column represent the cost of continued health and welfare coverage to which each of Mr. Rubin and the other named
executive officers may become entitled to under the Rubin Employment Agreement (as amended by his letter agreement described in “The Merger
—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers—Arrangements with Amazon”) and Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan and
related eligibility notice, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Payments Upon Termination at
or Following Change in Control.” To be eligible for such “double-trigger” health and welfare benefits continuation payments, the employment of
the executive officer must terminate in a Qualifying CIC Termination. The full amount represents the cost of continuing health and welfare coverage
for the entire severance period and assumes actual benefit elections made by each executive officer for the 2022 calendar year continue unchanged
for the severance period.

Ms. Lockhart resigned from her position in July 2021 and continued as a part-time employee through December 31, 2021. She is not entitled to any
compensatory payments in connection with the Merger.
Equity Awards Held by 1Life’s Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors
As discussed above in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Treatment of 1Life Options, 1Life RSUs and 1Life Phantom Awards,” at the Effective Time, each vested 1Life Option and vested 1Life RSU will be
canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares subject to
such award, and (ii) the Merger Consideration (or, for each 1Life Option, the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over such 1Life Option’s per
share exercise price).
At the Effective Time, unvested 1Life Options and unvested 1Life RSUs will be converted into cash-based awards with an equivalent value based on the
Merger Consideration (or, for each unvested 1Life Option, the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over such 1Life Option’s per share exercise
price), and such cash-based awards will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the 1Life Options or 1Life RSUs
immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Each of our named executive officers is eligible to receive the applicable vesting acceleration benefits with respect to his or her equity awards described
above under the section captioned “The Merger—Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control.”

The number of shares of common stock subject to 1Life Options includes both vested and unvested 1Life Options. The estimated number of shares subject to the
vested and unvested portions of the 1Life Options as of the assumed Closing Date, August 8, 2022, and the value (determined as the aggregate number of
underlying shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration minus the aggregate exercise price with respect to such shares) of those portions of the 1Life Options are
provided in the table below. For any 1Life Options with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration, the number of shares is included in the
number of Options but the value reflected in the table above is $0.

This number reflects the estimated number of shares of common stock subject to 1Life RSUs as of the assumed Closing Date, August 8, 2022, including the
Retention 1Life RSUs. This number does not include 583,090 shares of common stock underlying the Retention 1 Life RSUs granted to Mr. Rubin on August 12,
2022. Under the terms of 1Life Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy, any outstanding 1Life RSUs held by non-employee directors will become fully
vested upon the Closing.

From time to time, our non-employee directors and named executive officers have adopted, and may in the future adopt written plans, known as Rule 10b5-1
plans, through which they contract with a broker to sell shares of our common stock on a periodic basis pursuant to parameters established by such non-employee
director or named executive officer when entering into the plan. We expect certain of our non-employee directors and named executive officers will continue
adopting such plans in the ordinary course, and selling shares pursuant to adopted plans, prior to the Effective Time. Any such plans may cover a significant
portion of the applicable non-employee director’s or named executive officer’s holdings of our common stock.
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders of 1Life (i) who continuously hold shares of 1Life common stock through the
effective date of the Merger, (ii) who did not vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) who are entitled to demand appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, (iv) who otherwise properly comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL;
and (v) who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares, fail to perfect or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to demand appraisal of their shares and receive, if the Merger is successful and the Merger is
consummated, in lieu of the Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the “fair value” of their shares (as of the Effective Time, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any), as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should be aware that the fair value of their shares could be more than, the same as
or less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration
payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any
stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the
procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights.
The following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders who wish to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL. A copy of the full text of the version of Section 262 of the DGCL applicable to the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy as Annex C. This
summary does not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the DGCL. All references in
Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person
holding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the
stockholder of record to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to timely and fully
comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should
assume that 1Life will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any stockholder.
Any stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the DGCL and is urged to consult his,
her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor
does it constitute a recommendation that 1Life stockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of the stockholders, the corporation, not less than
twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of the stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available under Section 262 of the DGCL that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes the
formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the required copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex C.
69
Table of Contents
Any stockholder who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the following
discussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified may result in the loss of appraisal rights
under the DGCL.
If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the following:
•
deliver to 1Life a written demand for appraisal of your shares of 1Life common stock prior to the taking of the vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement, which written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote
abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting “AGAINST” or failing to vote “FOR” the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL;
•
not vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
continuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made through the effective date of the
Merger; and
•
comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including the requirement that the
surviving corporation or a stockholder who has validly demanded appraisal of his, her or its shares file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of all such stockholders’ shares of common stock within 120 days after the effective
date of the Merger.
Within ten (10) days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the effective date of the Merger to those
stockholders of 1Life who have properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL,
has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and has not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is
consummated, a failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above (or to take any of the
other steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your appraisal rights. At any time within sixty (60) days after
the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has demanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, specified by the Merger Agreement for his,
her or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger will require the written approval of the
Surviving Corporation and no appraisal proceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the approval
of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however,
that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within sixty
(60) days after the effective date of the Merger. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a stockholder’s request to withdraw a demand for appraisal
when the approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder would be
entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding. This value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the
value of the Merger Consideration.
Written Demand by the Stockholder
All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to 1Life Healthcare, Inc., One Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900, San Francisco, CA 94111. Attention:
Corporate Secretary. The demand for appraisal must be
70
Table of Contents
executed by or for the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder’s name appears on the stockholder’s shares (whether in book entry
or on physical certificates). If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be
made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be
made by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of
record, but such agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record
owner or owners of such shares.
A beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a
timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee who in turn holds
the shares through a central securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of
the depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record.
The beneficial holder of the shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record of the
shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.
A record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee for several beneficial owners may
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held
for other beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a
demand for appraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such stockholder.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and
is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their shares in
favor of the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for
all stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their shares. None of Amazon, Merger Sub or 1Life, as the Surviving Corporation, has any
obligation to or has any present intention to file a petition and stockholders should not assume that any of the foregoing parties will file a petition or will
initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the stockholders to initiate all necessary action to
perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and the requirements for exercise
of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which 1Life has received demands for appraisal, and the
aggregate number of stockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within ten (10) days after a written request therefor has been received
by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person who is
the beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been properly made
and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement
described in this paragraph.
71
Table of Contents
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation
will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after receiving service of a copy of the petition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly
verified list (the “Verified List”) containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the “Dissenting
Stockholders”) and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a petition by a Dissenting Stockholder,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a hearing and that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition will be mailed to the
Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting Stockholders shown on the Verified List. Notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of
the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the
Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
If a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to determine which Dissenting Stockholders have complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require that Dissenting
Stockholders submit their share certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does not comply with
such requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their share certificates after the Effective Time and thereafter comply with
all orders of the Delaware Court of Chancery in respect of such certificates. In addition, assuming the shares remain listed on a national securities
exchange immediately before the Effective Time, which we expect to be the case, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to dismiss the appraisal
proceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding
shares eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the
judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which
case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid by the Surviving Corporation and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that
time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of
Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and
that “fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in
making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the
nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of
72
Table of Contents
future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of
speculation, may be considered.” Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion that does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in
a merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the
terms of the Merger Agreement.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder
whose name appears on the Verified List and who has submitted such stockholder’s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if
such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. When the fair
value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders
entitled thereto, forthwith in the case of holders of uncertificated stock or upon surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such shares
in the case of certificated stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be
enforced. The Delaware Court of Chancery may also (i) determine the costs of the proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and
expenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder,
order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any Dissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence
of such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations by the Delaware Court of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware
Supreme Court.
Stockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 of the DGCL
could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to be paid in the Merger. Although 1Life believes that the Merger
Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Neither
Amazon nor 1Life anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and each of Amazon and 1Life reserve the
right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of the shares is less than the Merger
Consideration.
The process of exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites. Stockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should
consult with their own legal counsel in connection with compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective date of
the Merger, be entitled to vote his, her or its shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions thereon, except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date prior to the Effective Time.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such stockholder’s
right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, the stockholder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days
after the effective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as 1Life has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to do so, any stockholder
who desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely
73
Table of Contents
basis. In addition, a stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its
demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering to 1Life a written withdrawal of such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and acceptance of the terms of the Merger either within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger or
thereafter with the written approval of 1Life. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed
as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware
Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
Merger Consideration within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.`
STOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.
The foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of 1Life to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not purport to be a complete statement
of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of 1Life desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. You
should also be aware that Section 262 of the DGCL was amended after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the date of this proxy statement.
However, those amendments by their terms do not apply to merger agreements entered into before August 1, 2022, such as the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, the version of Section 262 of the DGCL in effect immediately prior to the 2022 statutory amendments is the version of Section 262 of the
DGCL applicable to the Merger Agreement. A copy of the version of Section 262 of the DGCL applicable to the Merger Agreement is included as Annex C
to this proxy statement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S.
Holders (each as defined below). This summary is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects
of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is
based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Department regulations promulgated under the Code (the “Treasury
Regulations”), court decisions, published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to stockholders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address the tax consequences that may be relevant to stockholders who may be subject
to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:
•
banks, mutual funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions;
74Table of Contents
•
tax-exempt organizations;
•
retirement or other tax deferred accounts;
•
S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes or investors therein;
•
dealers in stocks and securities;
•
traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities;
•
regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;
•
entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules;
•
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the U.S;
•
stockholders who own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent (5%) or more of 1Life’s common stock (by vote or
value);
•
stockholders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
•
stockholders whose shares constitute qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Code;
•
stockholders who received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax qualified retirement plan or pursuant
to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
stockholders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or
resident outside the U.S;
•
stockholders subject to the Medicare tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax;
•
stockholders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of common stock
being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in the Code);
•
stockholders who are controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulate earnings to
avoid U.S. federal income tax; or
•
stockholders who do not vote in favor of the Merger and properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial
owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors
regarding the consequences of the Merger.
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following
summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS
in the event of litigation.
THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX PLANNING. WE URGE YOU TO
CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the U.S;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the U.S. or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and the control of one or more U.S. persons as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S.
person.
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of common stock that is not a U.S. Holder nor an entity classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder
and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of
shares (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.
Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in
such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals,
are currently taxed at preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax
treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), in which case such gain
generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. Holders, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,
such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty); or
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the Merger, and certain other
requirements are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%), which gain may be
offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns
with respect to such losses.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may apply to the proceeds received by a stockholder
pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a
substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a certification of such stockholder’s foreign status on the appropriate series of
IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or
76
Table of Contents
(ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (commonly known as
“FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially
defined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and
provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and
debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also
generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity
provides the withholding agent with either a certification that it does not have any substantial direct or indirect U.S. owners or provides information
regarding substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and an applicable foreign country
may modify these requirements. FATCA withholding currently applies to payments of dividends. The Treasury Department has released proposed
regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) applicable to the gross proceeds of
a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may
generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Stockholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the disposition of common stock
pursuant to the Merger.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
Under the HSR Act, certain acquisitions may not be completed until information has been furnished to the DOJ and the FTC, and the applicable HSR Act
waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the Merger is thirty (30) calendar days, unless the
waiting period is terminated earlier or extended. If the DOJ or FTC issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer
to as a “Second Request”), the parties must observe a second thirty (30)-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have
substantially complied with such Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties agree with the DOJ or FTC to delay
consummation of the Merger for a specified period of time.
The Merger is subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until each of 1Life and Amazon file a notification and report
form with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated and any voluntary agreement with
the DOJ or FTC not to consummate the Transactions has expired or been terminated.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the DOJ
or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other remedies. At any time before or after the completion of the
Merger, and notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state or foreign jurisdiction could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties,
77
Table of Contents
requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other
remedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances, including by seeking to intervene in the
regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining
required regulatory approvals. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and
approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions, restrictions, qualifications, requirements or limitations on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets,
license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or agree to other remedies, or require changes to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, or that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or if such challenge is made, what the result will be. These
conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain
all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time between the
approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.
1Life and Amazon have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the Merger Agreement.",81,85

As of August 22, 2022, two complaints were filed in federal court by purported stockholders of 1Life regarding the Merger. The first complaint was filed
on August 10, 2022, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned O’Dell v. 1Life Healthcare, Inc., Case No.
1:22-cv-06825. The second complaint was filed on August 22, 2022, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and is
captioned Finlayson v. 1Life Healthcare, Inc., Case No. 1:22-cv-07150. The aforementioned two complaints are collectively referred to as the
“Complaints.” The Complaints name as defendants 1Life and each member of the Board, collectively referred to as the “1Life Defendants.” The
Complaints allege violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all 1Life Defendants and allege violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act
against the members of the Board in connection with disclosures made by the 1Life Defendants related to the Merger. The Complaints seek, among other
relief, (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger unless the 1Life Defendants disclose certain information requested by the plaintiffs,
(ii) rescission and/or rescissory damages in the event the Merger is consummated, and (iii) an award of plaintiffs’ expenses and attorneys’ fees. The 1Life
Defendants believe the claims in the Complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions.
Additionally, on August 20, 2022, 1Life received a demand letter and draft complaint from a purported stockholder of 1Life, which seek that certain
allegedly omitted information in the Schedule 14A filed on August 10, 2022, be disclosed.
It is possible that additional lawsuits may be filed or demand letters received related to the Merger between the day of this proxy statement and
consummation of the Merger. If additional similar lawsuits are filed or demand letters received, absent new or different allegations that are material, 1Life
will not necessarily announce such additional filings, unless such announcement or disclosure is required by law.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and
elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached
to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger
Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger
Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by
this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (i) were made only for purposes of
the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) may be subject to
important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement and contained in the confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, the representations and warranties have been
included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub rather than to establish
matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders
are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any
descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of 1Life, Amazon or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or

Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of 1Life,
Amazon and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure schedule to the
Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger
Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide

Effects of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers
The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into 1Life. As a result of the Merger, (a) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease,
and 1Life will continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger and (b) the Merger will have the effects set forth in the Merger Agreement and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges and powers of 1Life and Merger Sub will vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of 1Life and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.
At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of 1Life as in effect as of July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement (the “1Life Charter”) will
be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form attached to the Merger Agreement as Exhibit A, until subsequently amended as provided
in the 1Life Charter or by applicable law. Amazon and 1Life will take such actions reasonably necessary to cause the bylaws of 1Life as in effect as of the
July 20, 2022, date of the Merger Agreement (the “1Life Bylaws”) to be amended in their entirety pursuant to the Merger to conform to the bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name will be “1Life Healthcare, Inc.”), and as so amended will be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until subsequently amended as provided in the 1Life Bylaws or by applicable law.
79Table of Contents
At the Effective Time: (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the only directors of the Surviving Corporation as of
immediately following the Effective Time and (b) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the only officers of the
Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.
Closing and Effective Time
Unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Closing will take place by electronic exchange of deliverables at 9:00
a.m., New York time, on the third (3rd) business day after the satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible under applicable law) of all of the conditions

satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible))), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Amazon and 1Life. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in the Merger Agreement as the “Closing Date.”
On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Amazon and 1Life may agree to in writing, Amazon, Merger Sub and 1Life will cause a certificate of merger
(the “Certificate of Merger”) to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as required by and in accordance
with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by Amazon and 1Life and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the
DGCL, such date and time are referred to as the “Effective Time.”
Merger Consideration
Common Stock
Each share of 1Life common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Share” and collectively, the “Shares”), other
than the Excluded Shares, will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $18.00 in cash, without interest.
Treatment of 1Life Options, 1Life RSUs and 1Life Phantom Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, subject to all applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements, each:

that, pursuant to its terms as in effect as of July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement, would become vested as of the Effective Time (with any
market or performance conditions applicable to such 1Life Options determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement relating thereto as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time), and has an exercise price per Share that is less than the Merger Consideration, will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the
applicable exercise price per Share of such 1Life Option and (B) the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon exercise of such 1Life Option or portion
thereof; Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments described in this clause (i) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later
than the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following the Effective Time);
(ii) outstanding and unexercised 1Life Option or portion thereof that is unvested and that is not canceled in accordance with the provisions of the Merger
Agreement described in clause (i) above or clause (iii) below will,
80
Table of Contents
by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per Share of such 1Life Option and (B) the aggregate number of
Shares subject to such unvested 1Life Option or portion thereof as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Unvested Option Payment”), provided
that such Unvested Option Payment (x) will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to such unvested 1Life Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) will vest in installments over the remainder of the vesting schedule of such 1Life Option based on the same
percentage of the 1Life Option that would have vested on each applicable vesting date, with each such installment to be paid as soon as reasonably
practicable (but no more than thirty (30) calendar days) following such vesting date, and (z) will be subject to forfeiture on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such 1Life Option; the transactions described in this clause (ii) will in all cases be effected in a manner intended to comply with
Section 409A of the Code;
(iii) 1Life Option, whether vested or unvested, that has an exercise price per Share that is greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled without
the payment of consideration;
(iv) outstanding restricted stock unit award granted under any 1Life Stock Plan (each, a “1Life RSU”) that is unvested as of the Effective Time will, by
virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such unvested 1Life RSU as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the “Unvested RSU Payment”), provided that such Unvested RSU Payment (x) will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture
provisions as were applicable to such unvested 1Life RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) will vest in installments over the remainder of the
vesting schedule of such 1Life RSU based on the same percentage of the 1Life RSU that would have vested on each applicable vesting date, with each
such installment to be paid as soon as reasonably practicable (but no more than thirty (30) calendar days) following such vesting date, and (z) will be
subject to forfeiture on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such 1Life RSU;
(v) 1Life RSU that is vested and outstanding or payable immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of Shares underlying such 1Life RSU; Amazon
will cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments described in this clause (v) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the thirtieth
(30th) calendar day following the Effective Time); provided, however, in the event that such payment would cause any additional taxes to be payable
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payment to pay such amounts at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code; and
(vi) outstanding phantom award (each, a “1Life Phantom Award”) granted under the Iora Third Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan will
remain outstanding and continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as applicable to such 1Life Phantom Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors (and/or the compensation committee (or equivalent committee) of the Board of Directors) will adopt
such resolutions as are necessary to give effect to the transactions described above.
Treatment of Purchase Rights Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Merger Agreement provides that, as soon as practicable after July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement, 1Life will take all actions with respect
to the 1Life ESPP that are necessary to provide that: (a) no employee may elect to participate in the 1Life ESPP after July 20, 2022, (b) with respect to the
offering period currently in progress as of July 20, 2022 (the “Purchase Plan Offering Period”), (i) no participant may increase
81
Table of Contents
the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on July 20, 2022 for the Purchase Plan Offering Period and (ii) the
Purchase Plan Offering Period will terminate at the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for the Purchase Plan Offering Period, which is November 15,
2022, and (y) immediately prior to the Effective Time, (c) each participant’s accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase Shares in accordance
with the terms of the 1Life ESPP on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for the Purchase Plan Offering Period, which is November 15, 2022, and
(y) immediately prior to the Effective Time, (d) no additional offering periods will commence thereafter and (e) the 1Life ESPP will terminate, effective at the
Effective Time.
Convertible Notes
The Merger Agreement provides that, at and prior to the Closing, 1Life will (and Amazon will cooperate with 1Life to) comply with the provisions of the
Indenture dated as of May 29, 2020 (the “Indenture”) between 1Life, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), relating to
the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2025 in an aggregate principal amount of $316,250,000.00 issued under and pursuant to the Indenture
(the “Convertible Notes”), including executing and delivering a supplemental indenture to the Indenture in form satisfactory to the Trustee (as defined in
the Indenture) in connection with the Merger and the delivery, issuance or entry into any notices, certificates or other documents or instruments required
to comply with the Indenture; provided that (i) 1Life will deliver a copy of any such supplemental indenture, notice, certificate, legal opinion or other
document to Amazon at least three (3) business days prior to delivering or entering into such supplemental indenture, notice, certificate, legal opinion or
other document in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and will in each case consider in good faith any comments that Amazon has with respect
thereto; (ii) 1Life will notify Amazon promptly after making any settlement election (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by sharing a copy of any
relevant Settlement Notice (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to any Conversion Date (as defined in the Indenture)) under the Indenture; and (iii)
prior to the Closing, 1Life will not, except as otherwise described in this paragraph, amend, modify, supplement or terminate the Indenture or take any
action that would result in a change to the Conversion Rate (as defined in the Indenture as in effect on the date hereof) without the prior written consent
action that would result in a change to the Conversion Rate (as defined in the Indenture as in effect on the date hereof) without the prior written consent
of Amazon, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in the event that Amazon desires to consummate a repurchase offer or similar transaction, in each case in
Amazon’s sole discretion, with respect to any or all of the Convertible Notes (any such transaction, a “Repurchase Transaction”), each of 1Life, Amazon
and Merger Sub will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to, and will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective subsidiaries and representatives (and, in the case of 1Life, the Trustee under the Indenture) to, cooperate with one another in good faith to
permit such Repurchase Transaction to be effected on such terms, conditions and timing as reasonably requested by Amazon, and 1Life will use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Amazon in the preparation of any documentation related thereto reasonably requested by Amazon, in each case
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Amazon; provided that (i) the Repurchase Transaction will not be consummated prior to the Closing;
and (ii) Amazon will pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by 1Life in taking actions requested by Amazon in
connection with a Repurchase Transaction.
Exchange and Payment Procedures
The Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the Effective Time, Amazon will (i) appoint a bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by 1Life as (the “Paying Agent”), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to 1Life (the “Paying Agent Agreement”), with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Merger Agreement. At or before the Closing, Amazon will deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”). The
82
Table of Contents
Payment Fund will not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Amazon; provided,
however, that such investments will be in obligations of or guaranteed by the U.S. or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S., and that such investments will only be invested in the manner provided in the Paying Agent Agreement. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation.
As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within five (5) business days thereafter), Amazon will cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the “Certificates”), which Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (if any) will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent, and will otherwise be in customary form and have such other provisions as Amazon or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Amazon, and upon
delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates. Any Certificates so surrendered will then be canceled. The
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will
be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will have established to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such taxes either have been paid or are not payable. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (“Book-Entry Shares”), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, each registered holder of one or more such Book-Entry
Shares will automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within five (5) business days thereafter), the Merger Consideration payable for
each such Book-Entry Share. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Representations and Warranties
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub.
Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by 1Life are qualified as to “materiality” or “1Life Material Adverse Effect.”
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “1Life Material Adverse Effect” means any event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect that,
individually or in the aggregate with any other event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect, has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the assets, business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of (a)
1Life, (b) 1Life’s subsidiaries and (c) all of the professional medical organizations and professional limited liability companies and other entities and any
and all of their subsidiaries, to which 1Life or any of its subsidiaries provides administrative and business support
83
Table of Contents
services under a management services agreement or administrative services agreement (collectively, the “Affiliated Practices” and together with 1Life and
1Life’s subsidiaries, the “1Life Group”), taken as a whole. However, in no event will any of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to
constitute, nor will any of the following be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a 1Life Material Adverse Effect:
(i)
any event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect to the extent resulting from or relating to:
a.
a change in general economic, political, regulatory, business, financial, credit or capital market conditions, or any changes therein,
including interest or exchange rates;

50% of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the 1Life Group, taken as a whole, (ii) is on terms that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms and conditions
of the Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors deems relevant) are more favorable to 1Life’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (taking into account any bona fide proposed amendment or modification (or new

provision in the event that (i) doing so is required to permit a party to confidentially submit an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors (or any

expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iii) 1Life promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notifies Amazon of any
such waiver, amendment or release and (iv) such waiver, amendment or release is effective only upon Amazon’s receipt of such notice.

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, 1Life may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement, solely to

release would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y) 1Life promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notifies Amazon of any such waiver, amendment or release; provided, however, that, prior to the receipt of the 1Life Stockholder Approval,
nothing contained in the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement will prevent 1Life or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) from
furnishing information to, or engaging in negotiations or discussions with, any person that after July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement made a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach (or a deemed breach) of the non-solicitation provisions

notify any person of the existence of certain of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement), (A) the Board of Directors (1) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal, and (2) determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) 1Life provides written notice to Amazon of the determination referenced in clause (A)

confidentiality agreement. 1Life will deliver to Amazon a copy of any executed acceptable confidentiality agreement entered into after July 20, 2022, the
date of the Merger Agreement, promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following its execution. 1Life will provide any non-public information
concerning 1Life or any of the 1Life subsidiaries provided by 1Life or any 1Life subsidiary to any person entering into an acceptable confidentiality
agreement pursuant to certain of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement that has not been previously provided to Amazon prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person.
1Life will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after knowledge of receipt by an executive officer or director of 1Life) (i) provide Amazon written
notice of (A) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including any modification in any material respect thereto) or (B) any inquiries, proposals or offers
received by, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, 1Life, any 1Life subsidiary or, any representatives of 1Life
concerning, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) disclose to Amazon the identity of such person making, and
an unredacted copy of, any such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry, offer, proposal or request made in writing (or, if made orally, a reasonably
detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request). 1Life will, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof (and in any
event within 24 hours), provide Amazon (and its outside counsel) with copies of all drafts and final versions of definitive or other agreements including
schedules and exhibits thereto relating to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case exchanged between 1Life or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the person making such Acquisition Proposal or any of its representatives, on the other hand. 1Life will, in person or by telephone, keep
Amazon reasonably informed on a prompt (and in any event within 24 hours of such event) basis of the status and details (including with respect to any
change in price or other amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request concerning an Acquisition Proposal.
1Life will promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, following a determination in good faith by the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Amazon of such
determination.

The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; 1Life Adverse Recommendation Change
As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the holders of 1Life
common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change except as described below.
Except as expressly set forth in certain non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, during the Pre-Closing Period, neither 1Life nor the Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof), as applicable, will, and neither will publicly propose to take any of the following actions (any such action, other than
those set forth in clause (iii) below, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”):
(i)
withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to Amazon or Merger Sub) the recommendation of the Board of
Directors;
(ii)
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal;
(iii)
enter into any Acquisition Agreement;
(iv)
refrain from recommending against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within the earlier of (x) ten (10) business
days after the commencement thereof and (y) the third (3rd) business day prior to the date of the Special Meeting (but only if the
commencement is prior to such date);
(v)
after public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal by the third party making such Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acquisition
Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act), fail to publicly affirm the recommendation of the Board of Directors within the
earlier of (x) five (5) business days after a written request by Amazon to do so and (y) by the close of business on the second business day
immediately preceding the scheduled date of the Special Meeting after a written request by Amazon to do so) (it being understood that
1Life will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than one occasion with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal); or
(vi)
authorize, commit, resolve or agree to take any such actions.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, prior to the receipt of the 1Life Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors (i) may
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) may, in respect of the immediately following clause (x), cause 1Life to terminate the Merger
Agreement by written notice to Amazon of such termination (with respect to this clause (ii), so long as, prior to or substantially concurrently with, and as
a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination, 1Life pays to Amazon the 1Life Termination Fee) if (x) 1Life receives a written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement that the Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or (y) an Intervening Event
occurs and as a result thereof the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that:
•
prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or to terminating the Merger Agreement in
certain circumstances in accordance with its terms, (A) 1Life has notified Amazon in writing that it intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances in accordance with its terms (which notice will not
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (B) 1Life has provided Amazon a summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, (C) if requested to do so by Amazon, for a period of five (5) business days following delivery of such notice, 1Life will
have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and will have made the representatives of 1Life reasonably available to
93
Table of Contents
discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Amazon and its representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement or any new proposal made by Amazon in good faith; and (D) no earlier than the end of such five (5)
business day period, the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisor), will have determined in
good faith, after considering the terms of any such proposed amendment or modification to the Merger Agreement or new proposal
proposed by Amazon during such five (5) business day period, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances in accordance with its
terms in connection therewith would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (it being understood and agreed that any
change to the material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder will require a new notice to Amazon as
provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices references herein to a “five (5) business day period” will be deemed to be
references to a “three (3) business day period”); and
•
prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening Event, (A) 1Life has notified Amazon in writing
that it intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse
Recommendation Change, (B) if requested to do so by Amazon, for a period of five (5) business days following delivery of such notice,
1Life will have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and will have made the representatives of 1Life reasonably available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith, with Amazon and its representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement or new proposal made by Amazon in good faith and (C) no earlier than the end of such five (5) business day period, the
Board of Directors will have determined in good faith following consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, after
considering the terms of any such proposed amendment or modification to the Merger Agreement or new proposal proposed by Amazon
during such five (5) business day period, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the
Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Indemnification and Insurance
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will, and Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest
extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of 1Life and the 1Life subsidiaries under (i) the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of 1Life or the 1Life subsidiary in effect as of July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger
Agreement, and (ii) any and all indemnification agreements between 1Life or any 1Life subsidiary and any of their respective present or former directors
and officers (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), and such indemnification agreements will survive the Merger and will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Parties, except, in each case, to the extent
required by applicable law. In addition, except to the extent required by applicable law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth in the 1Life Charter or the 1Life
Bylaws, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, and any claim made pursuant to such rights within such six (6) year period will
continue to be subject to certain indemnification and insurance provisions of the Merger Agreement until disposition of such claim.
For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and settlement amounts incurred by that Indemnified Party in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after the Effective Time),
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as (or the fact that such person
is or was) a director or officer of 1Life or any
94
Table of Contents
1Life subsidiary, on or before the Effective Time, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Surviving Corporation will pay, within fifteen (15) days
after receipt by Amazon of a written request by an Indemnified Party or its representative, all costs and expenses of such Indemnified Party in connection
with matters for which such Indemnified Party is eligible to be indemnified pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the Merger Agreement in
advance of the final disposition of any such Action, subject to receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in a final
and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification described in this paragraph. In the event of any such Action, (i) subject to the undertaking described in the previous sentence, the
Surviving Corporation will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel will be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received, (ii) neither Amazon nor the Surviving Corporation will settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action and does not contain an admission of fault or wrongdoing or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (iii) Amazon and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that neither Amazon nor the Surviving Corporation will be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation’s written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and provided further that, in the event that any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim will continue until the disposition
of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party under the indemnification provisions of the Merger Agreement will be in addition to any rights such
person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of 1Life and the Surviving Corporation or any of
their subsidiaries, or under any law or under any indemnification agreement of any Indemnified Party with 1Life or any 1Life subsidiary.
Prior to the Effective Time, 1Life will cause to be obtained, effective at the Effective Time, “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6)
years from the Effective Time with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in amount and scope (including with respect to coverage and
deductibles) at least as favorable as 1Life’s existing policies as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or prior to the Effective Time. If for any reason 1Life fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, Amazon will cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies
maintained by 1Life as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation may substitute such policies
with policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are substantially similar with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event will 1Life or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, be required to expend more than an amount per
year equal to 300% of current aggregate annual premiums paid by 1Life for such insurance; provided further that in the event of an expiration, termination
or cancellation of such current policies, Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain policies that provide as much coverage as is reasonably
possible under substantially similar policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.
In the event Amazon or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into
any other person and will not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns
of Amazon or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will succeed to the obligations set forth in the indemnification and insurance provisions of
the Merger Agreement.
Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under the indemnification and insurance
provisions of the Merger Agreement.
95
Table of Contents
The indemnification and insurance provisions of the Merger Agreement will survive the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their successors, assigns and heirs (each of whom will be third party beneficiaries of the
indemnification and insurance provisions of the Merger Agreement) and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable law, the indemnification and insurance provisions
of the Merger Agreement may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Parties or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Parties.
Employee Benefits
The Merger Agreement provides that, for a period of one (1) year immediately following the Effective Time, Amazon will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to and to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Affiliated Practice Documents and subject to applicable law,
cause the Affiliated Practices to, provide each employee of 1Life and each employee of each of the 1Life subsidiaries and each employee of each of the
Affiliated Practices as of the Effective Time who continue to be employed after the Effective Time (other than those employees covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, each, an “Employee”) with (i) guaranteed cash payments and annual target cash bonus opportunities under 1Life’s annual
incentive plan and target commissions opportunities (excluding retention, change in control and equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable
than such Employee’s guaranteed cash payments and annual target cash bonus opportunities under 1Life’s annual incentive plan and target
commissions opportunities immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) and employee benefits (excluding any equity and long-term cash incentive
compensation, defined benefit pension and post-employment health and welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Amazon will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts of 1Life and the 1Life subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are with any current or former Employees or directors of 1Life or any 1Life subsidiary, including 1Life’s change in control severance plan and
arrangements.
Amazon will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Employees to receive service credit for service accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the
Effective Time with 1Life, any 1Life subsidiary, any Affiliated Practice and all affiliates for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual
(but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan and excluding for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits
or retiree medical benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Amazon, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (each, an “Amazon Plan”) to
the same extent recognized by 1Life or any of the 1Life subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that such crediting of service will not operate to duplicate any benefit for the same period of service. In addition, Amazon will use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, actively-at work
requirements and waiting periods under any Amazon Plan, except to the extent such condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of 1Life and the 1Life subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, for purposes of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, the
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Employees and their covered dependents in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.
If requested by Amazon in writing no later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the Effective Time, 1Life will, or will cause its applicable affiliate to, (i) adopt
resolutions to terminate 1Life’s 401(k) plans, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii) provide Amazon with
evidence that the 1Life’s 401(k) plans have been terminated, with the termination of the 1Life’s 401(k) plans effective no later
96
Table of Contents
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, pursuant to a duly adopted resolution of 1Life or its applicable affiliate (the form and substance of
which will be subject to review and approval by Amazon, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) no later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Amazon will take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to permit each eligible Employee who has
received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the 1Life’s 401(k) plans, if any, to roll such eligible rollover
distribution (including any associated plan loans) into an account under Amazon’s 401(k) plan, in accordance with and subject to the terms of Amazon’s
401(k) plan and the Code.
Efforts to Close the Merger
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Amazon, Merger Sub and 1Life will, and will cause their respective affiliates to use its
reasonable best efforts (subject to compliance with applicable law) to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including:
(i)
using reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, licenses, permits and waivers of all
governmental authorities that may be or become necessary for the performance of its obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
(ii)
cooperating fully with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, licenses, permits
and waivers;
(iii)
providing such other information to any governmental authority as such governmental authority may lawfully request in connection with
the Merger Agreement; and
(iv)
using reasonable best efforts to give any notices to non-governmental authority third parties and to obtain any consents, approvals or
waivers from non-governmental authority third parties that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions or disclosed
as such in 1Life’s disclosure schedule thereto, in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable following July 20, 2022, the date of the
Merger Agreement (it being understood and agreed that the parties will coordinate and cooperate in determining which of such notices to
non-governmental authority third parties they will give and which consents, approvals or waivers from non-governmental authority third
parties they will seek to obtain); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, none of 1Life, any 1Life subsidiary, Affiliated Practice or
Amazon or any subsidiary of Amazon will be required to make any payments or concessions in connection with the fulfillment of its
obligations under this paragraph (iv) and that neither 1Life nor any 1Life subsidiary or Affiliated Practice will pay any consideration or make
any agreements or commitments in connection with any such necessary consents, approvals or waivers without the prior written consent of
Amazon.
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement will, upon reasonable request by the other party, use reasonable best efforts to furnish the other party with
all material information concerning itself, its subsidiaries, its business and operations as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
obtaining any such non-governmental authority third party consent, approval or waiver identified in the foregoing sentence; provided that if such
disclosure (x) is prohibited by applicable law, the parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide such information in a manner that
does not violate law or (y) would result in a loss of such privilege, parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to allow for such disclosure (or
as much or it as possible) in a manner that would not result in a loss of such privilege, including to the extent requested by Amazon and if applicable, by
entering into a customary joint defense agreement that would alleviate such loss of privilege.
No later than ten (10) business days following July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement (unless a longer period is considered advisable and
agreed to by Amazon and 1Life), each party will make its respective
97
Table of Contents
filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and will supply as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter to the
appropriate governmental authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of the
parties to the Merger Agreement agrees to make as promptly as practicable after July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement, its respective filings
and notifications, if any, under any other applicable healthcare law or permit, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate
governmental authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable healthcare law. Each
party to the Merger Agreement will promptly notify the other of any notice from any person or governmental authority alleging that the consent of such
person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions.
Each party to the Merger Agreement will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts, and take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law or healthcare law that may be asserted by any governmental authority
so as to enable the parties to the Merger Agreement to consummate the Transactions prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything else contained in the Merger Agreement, (i) neither Amazon nor 1Life (nor any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) will
be required to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business (or, following the Closing, the combined business) in a specified
manner or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect thereto, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business
(or, following the Closing, the combined business) in a specified manner or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect thereto, or enter into or
agree to enter into a voting trust arrangement, proxy arrangement, “hold separate” agreement or arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement or to
agree to any restriction or condition, in each case, with respect to the assets, operations or conduct of their business (or, following the Closing, the
combined business) in a specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of Amazon, 1Life or their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates (provided that 1Life will agree to take (and will take) any such action with respect to 1Life and the 1Life subsidiaries and 1Life’s
affiliates to the extent (x) 1Life is requested in writing to do so by Amazon and (y) such action is only binding on or otherwise applicable to 1Life from and
after the Effective Time and in the event that the Closing occurs) and (ii) Amazon will not be required to commit to provide prior notice to, or seek prior
approval from, any governmental authority with respect to any future transaction. In addition, the parties to the Merger Agreement will defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any governmental authority or any other person under antitrust laws in order to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated or terminated, any order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date (as defined
below).
Each party to the Merger Agreement will keep the other parties apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and communications
from, any governmental authority with respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other parties to the Merger Agreement of any
communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any governmental authority relating to any review or investigation of the Transactions under the
HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust laws and will permit the other parties to review in advance (and to consider any comments made by the other
party in relation to) any proposed communication by such party to any governmental authority relating to such matters. None of the parties to the
Merger Agreement will agree to participate in any meeting, telephone call or discussion with any governmental authority in respect of any submissions,
filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters that are the subject of the Merger
Agreement unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such governmental authority, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to the Merger Agreement will coordinate and cooperate
fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. The parties to the Merger Agreement will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or
any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any governmental authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of 1Life, (ii) as
98
Table of Contents
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, Amazon will, after consultation with 1Life and consideration of
1Life’s views in good faith, have the right to direct, devise, and implement the strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, for responding to any
request from, inquiry by, or investigation by (including directing the timing, nature, and substance of all such filings or responses), for the determination
of any actions to be taken to eliminate any impediments to the Transactions under any antitrust or healthcare law, and for leading all meetings and
communications with any governmental authority that has authority to enforce any antitrust law, including with respect to any determination to (i) commit
to or agree with any governmental authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or (ii) withdraw and refile any
Notification and Report forms pursuant to the HSR Act (i.e., “pull and refile”).
Other Covenants
Stockholders Meeting
As promptly as reasonably practicable following July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement, and in any event within twenty (20) days, 1Life will
prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary proxy statement relating to the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Transactions by
1Life’s stockholders.
Stockholder Litigation
1Life has agreed to give Amazon reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense (at Amazon’s sole cost and subject to a joint defense agreement) of
any litigation, suit, claim, action, dispute, proceeding or investigation (an “Action”) brought by 1Life’s stockholders or other persons against 1Life or any
of its directors, officers or representatives arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement or the Transactions. 1Life has also agreed to give Amazon
the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by 1Life in connection with any such Action, and the right to consult on
the settlement with respect to, or other actions intended to moot, such Action, and 1Life will in good faith take such comments into account, and, no such
settlement or mooting action will be proposed or agreed to without Amazon’s prior written consent (which, except in the case of a settlement that includes
an admission of fault, will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 1Life will promptly notify Amazon of any such Action and will keep
Amazon reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof.
Unsecured Loan
During the Pre-Closing Period, Amazon has agreed to provide senior unsecured interim debt financing to 1Life in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$300 million to be funded in up to ten tranches of $30 million per month, beginning on March 20, 2023 until the earlier of Closing and the termination of the
Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, with a maturity date of 24 months after the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms (the
""Unsecured Loans""). 1Life will agree to certain restrictive covenants and events of default customary for transactions of this type in connection with the
interim debt financing, and other terms and conditions to be set forth in definitive agreements to be entered into by the parties in connection with the
interim debt financing. Promptly following the date of the Merger Agreement (and in any event no later than November 15, 2022), the parties will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and finalize definitive documentation evidencing such interim debt financing reflecting the terms
set forth in 1Life’s disclosure schedule and such other terms as the parties mutually agree (the “Definitive Financing Documentation”).

the representations and warranties of Amazon and Merger Sub contained in Article IV of the Merger Agreement (disregarding all
qualifications set forth therein relating to “materiality” or “material adverse effect” or other qualifications based on the word “material” or
similar phrases) must have been true and correct as of July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the
same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (except to the extent such representations and warranties are, by their terms, made
as of a specified date, in which case such representations and warranties must be so true and correct as of such specified date), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the

Amazon and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions;
•
each of Amazon and Merger Sub must have performed or complied in all material respects with each of the agreements and covenants
required by the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the Effective Time; and

Amazon will have delivered to 1Life a certificate, dated the Closing Date, signed by a duly authorized officer of Amazon, certifying as to the

Termination of the Merger Agreement
The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action taken or authorized
by the Board of Directors or Amazon board of directors (as applicable) of the terminating party or parties, notwithstanding any prior adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the stockholders of 1Life, as follows (the date of any such termination, the “Termination Date”):
•
by mutual written consent of Amazon and 1Life;
•
by either Amazon or 1Life:
•
if the Effective Time has not occurred on or before July 20, 2023 (the “Outside Date”); provided however, that if on the Outside Date
any of the conditions to Closing pertaining to a Restriction (as defined below) (to the extent relating to any approvals required to
consummate the transaction under the HSR Act) or the conditions to Closing relating to the expiration or termination of any waiting
periods applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or any voluntary agreement with the DOJ or FTC not to consummate the
Transactions have not been satisfied but all other conditions to Closing in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived or
will then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take place on such date, then the Outside Date will be automatically
extended to January 22, 2024; provided further that if on such extended Outside Date any of the conditions to Closing pertaining to
the absence of Restrictions (to the extent relating to any approvals required to consummate the transaction under the HSR Act) or the
conditions to Closing relating to the expiration or termination of any waiting periods applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or
any voluntary agreement with the DOJ or FTC not to consummate the Transactions have not been satisfied but all other conditions to
Closing in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived or will then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take
place on such date, then the Outside Date will be automatically extended one additional time to July 22, 2024. However, the right to
terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with the foregoing will not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
agreements and covenants under the Merger Agreement has been the principal cause of, or directly resulted in, the failure of the
Effective Time to occur on or before such date;

•
if any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law or order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger and such law or order will have
become final and nonappealable, or if there will be adopted following the date of execution of the Merger Agreement any law that
makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited (collectively, a “Restriction”). However, the right to terminate the
Merger Agreement pursuant to the foregoing will not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any agreements or covenants
under the Merger Agreement relating to efforts to consummate the Merger has been the principal cause of, or directly resulted in,
such law or order being enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced, entered or adopted, as applicable;
•
if the Merger Agreement fails to receive the 1Life Stockholder Approval at the Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof);
•
by Amazon:
•
prior to 1Life’s receipt of the 1Life Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors effects an Adverse Recommendation Change;
•
if 1Life has breached any of its representations or warranties, or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in the
Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure to be satisfied of either of the conditions to
Closing related to the accuracy of 1Life’s representations and warranties or 1Life’s performance of covenants and agreements and (ii)
is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date as it may be extended or, if curable by such date, is not cured within the earlier of
(A) thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof is given by Amazon to 1Life and (B) the Outside Date as it may be extended.
However, Amazon will not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to the foregoing if either Amazon or Merger
Sub is then in breach of any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement such
that either of conditions to Closing related to the accuracy of Amazon’s representations and warranties or Amazon’s performance of
covenants and agreements are not satisfied; or
•
by 1Life:
•
at any time prior to the time at which 1Life receives the 1Life Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors determines to enter into a
definitive Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement; provided that, (i) 1Life will have complied with the applicable procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement relating to
termination of the Merger Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and (ii) prior to or substantially concurrently with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of such termination, 1Life pays to Amazon the 1Life Termination Fee;
•
if Amazon or Merger Sub has breached any of its representations or warranties, or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure to be satisfied of
either of the conditions to Closing related to the accuracy of Amazon’s representations and warranties or Amazon’s performance of
covenants and agreements and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date as it may be extended or, if curable by such
date, is not cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof is given by 1Life to Amazon and (B) the
Outside Date as it may be extended. However, 1Life will not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing if 1Life is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement
such that either of the conditions to Closing related to the accuracy of 1Life’s representations and warranties or 1Life’s performance
of covenants and agreements are not satisfied.

Termination Fees and Expenses
The Merger Agreement contains certain remedies in the event of a termination.
1Life Termination Fee
1Life must pay to Amazon or its designee the amount of $136,000,000 (the “1Life Termination Fee”) upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
•
If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated (x) by Amazon or 1Life because the Merger Agreement fails to receive the 1Life Stockholder
Approval at the Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) or (y) by Amazon due to 1Life’s material breach of the
Merger Agreement, then, if (A) prior to the time of termination on the Termination Date, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
announced, disclosed or otherwise made public that remains outstanding and not publicly withdrawn as of, in the case of clause (x), the
date of the Special Meeting, and in the case of (y), the Termination Date and (B) within twelve (12) months of the Termination Date, 1Life
enters into, or submits to the 1Life stockholders for adoption, a binding written definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an
Acquisition Proposal (a “Specified Acquisition Agreement”) or consummates an Acquisition Transaction, then 1Life must pay to Amazon
or its designee the 1Life Termination Fee (net of any Expense Reimbursement (as defined below) previously paid), which payment must be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) business days following the earliest to occur of the entry by 1Life into
that Specified Acquisition Agreement, the submission of that Specified Acquisition Agreement to the 1Life stockholders for adoption or the
consummation by 1Life of that Acquisition Transaction, in each case, as referred to in clause (B) above.
•
If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by Amazon because, prior to 1Life’s receipt of the 1Life Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, then 1Life must pay to Amazon or its designee the 1Life Termination Fee,
which payment must be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) business days after the termination of the
Merger Agreement.
•
If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by 1Life because, at any time prior to the time at which 1Life receives the 1Life Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors determines to enter into a definitive Acquisition Agreement relating to a Superior Proposal in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement, then 1Life must pay to Amazon or its designee the 1Life Termination Fee, which payment must be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds prior to or substantially concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement.
Amazon Termination Fee
Amazon must pay to 1Life the amount of $195,000,000 (the “Amazon Termination Fee”) upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
•
If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by Amazon or 1Life because the Effective Time has not occurred on or before the Outside
Date (subject to certain exceptions set out in the Merger Agreement) and (x) at the time of the termination of the Merger Agreement, neither
of the following conditions were satisfied or waived by Parent: (i) the condition to Closing pertaining to the absence of Restrictions (in
respect of any matter involving antitrust laws) or (ii) the condition to Closing pertaining to the expiration or termination of any waiting
periods (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act or any voluntary agreement with the
DOJ or FTC not to consummate the Transactions; and (y) at the time of the termination of the Merger Agreement, each of the conditions to
Closing in the Merger Agreement, other than the conditions referred to in (i) and (ii) above, was satisfied (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but which conditions would have been satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
termination
103
Table of Contents
and other than those conditions to 1Life’s obligation to consummate the Merger), then Amazon must pay to 1Life the Amazon Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) business days of the applicable Termination Date accounts designated in
writing by 1Life.
•
If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by Amazon or 1Life because of a Restriction in respect of a matter involving antitrust laws,
then Amazon must pay to 1Life the Amazon Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) business days of
the applicable Termination Date accounts designated in writing by 1Life.
•
If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by 1Life because Amazon or Merger Sub has breached its covenants relating to using
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and make effective the Transactions, then Amazon must pay to 1Life the Amazon
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) business days of the applicable Termination Date accounts
designated in writing by 1Life.
In certain circumstances, the amount of the Amazon Termination Fee payable will be automatically reduced by the aggregate amount of cash outstanding
under the interim debt financing loans paid by Amazon to 1Life plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (provided that the amount of such reduction
will not exceed the amount of the Amazon Termination Fee). After giving effect to the reduction of the Amazon Termination Fee as described in the
immediately preceding sentence, 1Life’s outstanding obligations under the Definitive Financing Documentation will be correspondingly reduced by the
amount of such reduction.
Fees and Expenses; Expense Reimbursement
Subject to certain exceptions contained in the Merger Agreement, all Expenses (as defined below) incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement, the
Transactions, the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the closing of the Merger will be paid by the party incurring such
Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other Transaction is consummated, except as otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement. “Expenses,” as
used in the Merger Agreement, will include all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants to a party to the Merger Agreement and its affiliates) incurred (whether or
not billed) at any time (whether before or after July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement) by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to
the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of the Merger Agreement, and in the case of Amazon, with respect to its due
diligence investigation of 1Life and any 1Life subsidiaries.
However, in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by either 1Life or Amazon in certain circumstances pursuant to which 1Life fails to receive
the 1Life Stockholder Approval at the Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), 1Life will pay to Amazon all of the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by Amazon and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $20,000,000 (the “Expense Reimbursement”),
within two (2) business days after the date following such termination. To the extent any portion of the Expense Reimbursement is paid by 1Life to
Amazon, such amount paid will be deducted from the amount of any 1Life Termination Fee owed or that becomes payable.
Specific Performance
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of the
Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each party to the Merger
Agreement agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger
Agreement, the non-breaching party will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages, subject to certain exceptions contained in
104
Table of Contents
the Merger Agreement) to (i) seek an order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (ii)
seek an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each party further agrees that no other party or any other person will be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this paragraph, and each
party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument in connection with
such remedy.
Amendment
The Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties to the Merger Agreement by action taken by or on behalf of the Board of Directors or the Amazon
board of directors, as applicable, at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after receipt of the 1Life Stockholder Approval, no
amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which each Share will be converted upon consummation
of the Merger or that would otherwise require the approval of the stockholders of 1Life under applicable law. The Merger Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement.
Governing Law
The Merger Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable
principles of conflict of laws that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to otherwise govern the Merger Agreement,
except for all matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) of
the Definitive Financing Documentation will be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic law of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause the
application of law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of 1Life,
that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

1Life Healthcare Inc_20220824_DEFM14A_20299948_4508791.Pdf,PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL,"PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, 1Life is required to submit a proposal to our stockholders to
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to certain named executive officers of 1Life that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This compensation is summarized
in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to
review carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, 1Life is asking you
to approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of 1Life approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
1Life’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned ‘The Merger—Interests of 1Life’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger’.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Approval of the
Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and vote not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will
not be binding on 1Life. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation
Proposal will be payable to 1Life’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation
Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person,
by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject
matter, provided a quorum is present. Assuming the Special Meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be,
no shares will be present in person at the Special Meeting, and only shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be able to
be voted.
Assuming a quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting (including failure to give instruction to brokers, banks or
other nominees for shares held in “street name”) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, and (ii) abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal. Shares of 1Life common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and
unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a stockholder returns a properly signed proxy card without
indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of 1Life common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
Under the rules of Nasdaq, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for customers have the authority to vote on
“discretionary” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers, banks or other nominees are precluded
from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the
proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Because brokers, banks and other
nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal, if a
106Table of Contents
beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to
any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of shares of
common stock held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives
no instruction as to the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the
Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any
other proposal. Therefore, if you hold your shares in “street name,” it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish
to vote your shares.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of 1Life,
that you vote “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of this proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if the Board of Directors determines that it is necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If the
Board of Directors determines that it is necessary or appropriate, we will ask our stockholders to vote only on this Adjournment Proposal and not to vote
on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal.
In the Adjournment Proposal, we are asking our stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize the Board of Directors, in its discretion, to adjourn the
Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including
soliciting proxies from stockholders who have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among
other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against
adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting
without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of
the chairperson of the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires either (i) if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person, by
remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter
or (ii) if a quorum is not present, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the Special Meeting. Assuming the Special Meeting is
held solely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be present in person at the Special Meeting, and only
shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be able to be voted.
For the purpose of the Adjournment Proposal, (i) a failure to vote virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting (including failure to give instruction to
brokers, banks or other nominees on any of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting for shares held in “street name”) will have no effect on
the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal (but such shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special
Meeting, which may make it harder to establish a quorum for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting), and (ii) abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present. If your shares are deemed present or represented by proxy
at the Special Meeting, then a failure to vote your shares will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal if a quorum is present but will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal if a quorum is not present. Shares of 1Life common stock represented by properly
executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a stockholder returns a properly
signed and dated proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of 1Life common stock represented by that proxy will
be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended
by the Board of Directors.
Under the rules of Nasdaq, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for customers have the authority to vote on
“discretionary” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers, banks or other nominees are precluded
from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the
108Table of Contents
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with
respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, if a beneficial owner of shares of
common stock held in street name does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those
shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank
or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be
deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any
proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. If your shares are deemed present in person or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, then failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee
to vote shares held on your behalf) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal if a quorum is not present, but will have no
effect on the Adjournment Proposal if a quorum is present. Therefore, if you hold your shares in “street name,” it is important that you instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of 1Life,
that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “ONEM.” As of August 22, 2022, there were 195,812,174 shares of common stock outstanding
held by approximately 170 stockholders of record. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes
stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by banks, brokers and other nominees. We have never declared or paid
any cash dividends on our common stock.
On August 22, 2022, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price for 1Life’s common stock on Nasdaq
was $17.38 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common stock.
Following the Merger, there will be no further market for our common stock and it will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.
As a result, following the Merger we will no longer file periodic reports under the Exchange Act with the SEC. In the event that the Merger is not
consummated, our payment of any future dividends would be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on then-existing conditions,
including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our Board of

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of stockholders of 1Life.
However, if the Merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
1Life will hold a regular annual meeting of its stockholders in 2023 only if the Merger is not completed by then.
Stockholder Proposals for 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
In the event that 1Life holds the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder may present proper proposals for inclusion in the 1Life proxy
statement and for consideration at next year’s annual meeting of stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing to 1Life’s Corporate Secretary in a
timely manner. For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, 1Life’s
Corporate Secretary must receive the written proposal at 1Life’s principal executive offices not later than December 22, 2022. In addition, stockholder
proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored
proxy materials. Stockholder proposals should be addressed to:
1Life Healthcare, Inc.
Attention: Corporate Secretary
One Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900
San Francisco, California 94111
1Life’s amended and restated bylaws also establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders who wish to present a proposal before an annual
meeting of stockholders but do not intend for the proposal to be included in our proxy statement. 1Life’s amended and restated bylaws provide that the
only business that may be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders is business that is (i) specified in our proxy materials with respect to such
annual meeting, (ii) otherwise properly brought before such annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) properly brought before
such meeting by a stockholder of record entitled to vote at such annual meeting who has delivered timely written notice to our Corporate Secretary, which
notice must contain the information specified in our amended and restated bylaws. To be timely for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, our
Corporate Secretary must receive the written notice at our principal executive offices:
•
not earlier than the close of business on February 2, 2023; and
•
not later than the close of business on March 4, 2023.
In the event that we hold the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after the one-year anniversary of the
2022 Annual Meeting, then, for notice by the stockholder to be timely, it must be received by the Corporate Secretary not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting,
or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made.

Nomination of Director Candidates
Holders of 1Life common stock may propose director candidates for consideration by 1Life’s nominating and corporate governance committee. Any such
recommendations should include the nominee’s name and qualifications for membership on 1Life’s board of directors and should be directed to 1Life’s
General Counsel or legal department at the address set forth above.
In addition, 1Life’s amended and restated bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for election at an annual meeting of stockholders. To
nominate a director, the stockholder must provide the information required by 1Life’s amended and restated bylaws. In addition, the stockholder must
give timely notice to 1Life’s Corporate Secretary in accordance with 1Life’s amended and restated bylaws, which, in general, require that the notice be
received by 1Life’s Corporate Secretary within the time periods described above under the section in this proxy statement captioned “Other Matters—
Future Stockholder Proposals—Stockholder Proposals for 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders” for stockholder proposals that are not intended to be
included in a proxy statement.
In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under 1Life’s amended and restated bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy rules in connection
with 1Life’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than 1Life’s nominees
must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than April 3, 2023.

1Life Healthcare Inc_20220824_DEFM14A_20299948_4508791.Pdf,Householding of Special Meeting Materials,"Householding of Special Meeting Materials
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy materials with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single copy of the proxy materials addressed to those stockholders. This process,
which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
A single copy of the proxy materials will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from
the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address,
“householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in
“householding” and would prefer to receive a separate copy of proxy materials, please notify your broker, or notify Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at
1-866-540-7095 or by sending a written request to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Attention: Householding Department. 51 Mercedes Way,
Edgewood, New York 11717. Street name stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy materials at their addresses and would like to
request “householding” of their communications should contact their broker, bank or other nominee.

Board of Directors
1Life Healthare, Inc.
One Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900
San Francisco, CA 94111
Members of the Board:
We understand that 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (the “Company”), Amazon.com, Inc. (the “Buyer”) and Negroni Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (“Acquisition Sub”), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 20, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”),
which provides, among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the
“Company Common Stock”), other than shares (i) held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, (iii) owned by the Acquisition Sub, the Buyer or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer or (iv) as to which dissenters’
rights have been perfected under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”),
will be converted into the right to receive $18.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth
in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the
Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
1)
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company;
2)
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company;
3)
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
4)
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the Company;
5)
Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
6)
Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that of certain other
publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities;
7)
Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
8)
Participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Buyer and their financial and legal advisors;
9)
Reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and
10)
Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections, we
have assumed that theyTable of Contents
have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future
financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to such financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, we
have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or
delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Buyer will have sufficient immediately available funds to consummate the
Merger. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax, or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and
have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or
regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers,
directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common
Stock in the transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternatives
available to the Company, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may
affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financing services
for the Buyer and financial advisory and financing services for the Company and have received fees in connection with such services, and we are
currently a lender to Buyer, unrelated to the Merger. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer and
the Company and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management
businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and
derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates,

trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the
Buyer, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our customary
practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without
our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley
expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of the Company should vote at the shareholders’ meeting to be held in connection
with the Merger.

(a) Conversion of Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Share” and
collectively, the “Shares”), other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) or Dissenting Shares (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”),
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $18.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). The Merger Consideration is
payable in accordance with Section 2.02(b).
(b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Company Subsidiary and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) in advance by the Company (the “Paying Agent”), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent Agreement”), with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article II. At or before the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Company to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, and that such investments shall only be invested in the manner provided in the Paying Agent Agreement. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Company.
(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the “Certificates”), which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (if any) shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying
Agent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder
3Table of Contents
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates. Any Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a person other than the person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable. Any holder of
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each registered holder
of one or more such Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within five (5) Business Days thereafter),
the Merger Consideration payable for each such Book-Entry Share. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be
made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II.
(c) No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as
provided herein or by Law.
(d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any holders of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and Parent and the
Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor Surviving Company shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(e) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and Parent (each, a “Withholding Agent”) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted
Stock Unit Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, state or local Tax laws
and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate Governmental Authority; provided, that each such Withholding Agent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the recipient of such payment a reasonable opportunity to provide tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS
Form W-8, as applicable) in order to reduce or eliminate such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company or Parent, as the case may be, and duly paid to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be and none of the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Company or the Parent, as the case may be, shall be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to such deducted or withheld
amounts.

(f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if required by the Surviving Company, an indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety

Option”) or portion thereof that is vested or that, pursuant to its terms as in effect as of the date hereof, would become vested as of the Effective Time
(with any market or performance conditions applicable to such Company Stock Options determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement
relating thereto as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), and has an exercise price per Share that is less than the Merger Consideration, shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the amount by which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option or portion thereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to make the payments contemplated by this
Section 2.04(a) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following the Effective Time). All such payments
shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements.
(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option or portion thereof that is unvested and that is not canceled in
accordance with Section 2.04(a) or Section 2.04(c) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per Share
of such Company Stock Option and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such unvested Company Stock Option or portion thereof as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Unvested Option Payment”), provided that such Unvested Option Payment (x) shall be subject to the same
vesting and forfeiture provisions as were applicable to such unvested Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) shall vest in
installments over the remainder of the vesting schedule of such Company Stock Option based on the same percentage of the Company Stock Option that
would have vested on each applicable vesting date, with each such installment to be paid as soon as reasonably practicable (but no more than thirty (30)
calendar days) following such vesting date, and (z) shall be subject to forfeiture on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
Stock Option. The transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04(b) shall in all cases be effected in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of
the Code. All such payments shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements.
(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that has an exercise price per Share that is greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled without the payment of consideration.
(d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, a “Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award”) that is unvested as of the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted

file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is
required to be included in the Proxy Statement, and each covenants that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or first mailed to the Company’s stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall set a preliminary record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act and shall if necessary commence additional broker searches and/or adjust the preliminary record date as may be necessary to ensure that
the record date can be set on a date that is as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date, the Company shall establish a record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and shall
commence mailing the definitive Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.03(e), the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation without
any change or qualification. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide Parent with a copy of all written correspondence
between the Company or any Representatives of the Company, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with regard to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC and disseminating to holders of Shares and reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on all responses to requests for additional information, and shall accept all changes suggested by Parent in good faith unless it
would be unreasonable to do so. If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be filed with the SEC by the Company and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
(b) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement
Clearance Date, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
35Table of Contents
Company Stockholders’ Meeting; provided that the Company Stockholders’ Meeting shall not be initially scheduled to occur later than forty-five (45)
days following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date (unless the Company’s nationally recognized proxy solicitor advises that forty-five (45) days from the
date of mailing the Proxy Statement is insufficient time to submit and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, in which case, such later date to which
Parent consents (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld)). The Company shall not, without the consent of Parent,
adjourn or postpone, cancel, recess or reschedule, the Company Stockholders’ Meeting; provided, however, that the Company may postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders’ Meeting: (i) with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; (ii) if a quorum has not been established; (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is advisable under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to Company Stockholders’ Meeting; (iv) to
allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies, if and to the extent the Company reasonably believes the requisite Company Stockholder
Approval would not otherwise be obtained; or (v) if required by Law; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned (A) to a date later than the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the Outside Date (as it may be
extended pursuant to Section 8.01(b)), (B) for more than ten (10) Business Days in each instance or twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate from the
originally scheduled date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (C) if such postponement or adjournment would require a change to the record date for the Company
Stockholders’ Meeting.
(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and to take all
other actions necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, at the time of the
originally scheduled date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, a quorum has not been established or the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Company Stockholder Approval, then the Company shall, at the request of Parent (to the extent
permitted by Law), adjourn the Company Stockholders’ Meeting to a date specified by Parent; provided that the Company shall not be required pursuant
to this sentence to adjourn the Company Stockholders’ Meeting more than two times or for more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate from
the originally scheduled date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, and provided that no postponement or adjournment shall be required if it would
require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the Transactions and matters related to this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be the only matters that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders’
Meeting. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, the Company’s obligations to hold
the Company Stockholders’ Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or by any Adverse Recommendation Change.",164,165

entering into a customary joint defense agreement that would alleviate such loss of privilege.
(b) All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or its or their Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be kept confidential in accordance

Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any confidentiality or standstill provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to
which it or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party; provided, however, that the Company may grant a waiver of, and shall not be obligated to enforce,
any such provision in the event that (i) doing so is required to permit a party to confidentially submit an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the Company Board (or

duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company provides written notice to Parent of the determination referenced in clause (A) promptly (and in any event

promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following its execution. The Company shall provide any non-public information concerning the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries provided by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any person entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality

amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, following a determination in good faith by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such determination.
(d) Except as expressly set forth in Section 6.03(e), during the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee

Proposal (other than an Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act), fail to publicly affirm the Company Board
Recommendation within the earlier of (x) five (5) Business Days after a written request by Parent to do so and (y) by the close of business on the second
Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting after a written request by Parent to do so) (it being
understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than one occasion with respect to any such Acquisition
Proposal), or (vi) authorize, commit, resolve or agree to take any such actions (any such action, other than those set forth in the preceding clause (iii), an
“Adverse Recommendation Change”).
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (i) may
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) may, in respect of the immediately following clause (x), cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to Parent of such termination (with respect to this clause (ii), so long as, prior to or substantially concurrently with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of, such termination, the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee) if (x) the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach (or deemed breach), of this Section 6.03 that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (y) an Intervening Event occurs and
as a result thereof the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that
(i) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or to terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(f), (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) (which notice shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (B) the
Company has provided Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, which shall include (at a
minimum) all of the information that is specified in Section 6.03(c), (C) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of five (5) Business Days

Representatives of the Company reasonably available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and its Representatives, any bona
fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any new proposal made by Parent in good faith; and (D) no
earlier than the end of such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisor), shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any such proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement or new proposal proposed by Parent during
39

such five (5) Business Day period, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) in connection therewith would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any change to the material terms of a proposal that was
previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such
subsequent notices references herein to a “five (5) Business Day period” shall be deemed to be references to a “three (3) Business Day
period”); and
(ii) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening Event, (A) the Company has notified Parent
in writing that it intends to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse
Recommendation Change, (B) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of five (5) Business Days following delivery of such notice, the
Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the Representatives of the Company reasonably available
to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and its Representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or new proposal made by Parent in good faith and (C) no earlier than the end of such five (5) Business Day
period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith following consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
after considering the terms of any such proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement or new proposal proposed by Parent
during such five (5) Business Day period, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the
Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from issuing a “stop, look and listen” communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders if the Company
Board determines (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; provided that any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 6.03(e). For the
avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto (without including a reaffirmation) shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change as long as it is
accompanied by a statement reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation.
(g) Except as set forth in Section 8.03(d) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:
(i) “Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide written proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent or any of its

such case through the acquisition of one or more Company Subsidiaries owning such assets, or (B) more than 20% of the outstanding
Company Common Stock (or any Equity Interests convertible into, or exchangeable for, such Company Common Stock); (2) any tender offer
or exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated would result, directly or indirectly, in any person or group
(or the shareholders of any person or group) beneficially owning more than 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or securities
of any Company Subsidiaries with respect to which more than 20% of the net revenue, income, or assets (based on fair market value on a
consolidated basis) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is attributable, taken as a whole; or (3) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company which
would result in any person or group (or the shareholders of any person
40
Table of Contents
or group) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or more than 20% of the
voting power of the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such
surviving entity (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power). Whenever the term
“group” is used in this Agreement, it shall have the definition set forth in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.
(ii) “Intervening Event” means any material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition (other than an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) that was not known or
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of
which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement); provided, that in no event shall
any of the following constitute or be deemed to be an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal, (B)
changes in the stock price of the Company, (C) any breach by the Company of this Agreement or (D) the fact, in and of itself, that the
Company exceeds internal or published projections (it being understood, however, that the facts or causes underlying or contributing to
any of the matters described in the preceding clause (B) or (D) may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred).
(iii) “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by any person or group (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) after the date of this Agreement, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of this Section
6.03 that (A) would result in such person or group (or in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the
shareholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company Group, taken as a whole, (B) is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board deems relevant) are more favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any bona fide proposed amendment or modification (or new
proposal) proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 6.03(e)(i)), and (C) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects (including certainty of closing, certainty of financing and the identity of the person making the
Acquisition Proposal) of such proposal that the Company Board deems relevant.
(h) It is understood that for all purposes of this Agreement, in the event that any Representative of the Company Group takes any action which, if taken
by the Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 6.03, such action shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.03 by the Company.",166,170

extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under (i) the certificate of

otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Parties, except, in each case, to the extent
required by applicable Law. In addition, except to the extent required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Company shall contain provisions
41Table of Contents
no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, and any claim made pursuant to such rights within such six (6) year period shall continue to be subject to
this Section 6.04(a) and the rights provided under this Section 6.04(a) until disposition of such claim.

liabilities and settlement amounts incurred by that Indemnified Party in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after the Effective Time),
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as (or the fact that such person
is or was) a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on or before the Effective Time, and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
Surviving Company shall pay, within fifteen (15) days after receipt by Parent of a written request by an Indemnified Party or its representative, all costs
and expenses of such Indemnified Party in connection with matters for which such Indemnified Party is eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
6.04(b) in advance of the final disposition of any such Action, subject to receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in
a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under this Section 6.04(b). In the event of any such Action, (i) subject to the undertaking described in the previous sentence, the
Surviving Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Company, promptly after statements therefor are received, (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action and does not contain an admission of fault or wrongdoing or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Company’s written consent (which

not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition or
that such item would constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect and (y) shall not be construed as an admission by the Company of any non-
compliance with, or violation of, any third party rights (including any Intellectual Property rights) or any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority,

required to be disclosed under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any
