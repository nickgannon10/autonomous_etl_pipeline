immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than certain shares specified in the Merger Agreement) will be

In considering the recommendation of the Company's Board that Company stockholders vote to approve the
Merger Proposal, Company stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of SPX
FLOW have interests in the proposed Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Company stockholders generally. The Company's Board was aware of and considered these interests,
among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and in making its
recommendation that Company stockholders vote to approve the Merger Proposal. These interests may
include, among others:
•
The Merger Agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all Company Restricted
Shares, Options, Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units.
•
Certain of the Company's executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation
and benefits under existing agreements between such officers and the Company.

insurance coverage under indemnification agreements and the Merger Agreement.

federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless the stockholder has certain
connections to the United States. The tax consequences of the Merger to SPX FLOW stockholders will
depend upon their particular circumstances and each SPX FLOW stockholder should consult its own tax

Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), Company stockholders who do
not vote for the Merger Proposal will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of SPX
FLOW common stock as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware
Court of Chancery”) if the Merger is completed, but only if they comply fully with all of the applicable
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”), which are summarized in this proxy statement.
Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of
the Per Share Price. Any stockholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things,
submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote on the Merger Proposal and must not
vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal. Failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified in Section 262 will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of Section 262
relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to seek
the advice of your own legal counsel. The discussion of appraisal rights contained in this proxy statement is
not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by
the full text of Section 262 that is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated by
reference herein in its entirety.",16,16

If the Merger is completed, SPX FLOW common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered
under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Except as permitted by the Merger Agreement, the Company must not, and must not permit its subsidiaries
to, and must direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' directors, officers,
managers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives
(collectively, the “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, endorse, facilitate or solicit any inquiries, indications of interest, proposals or offers that
constitute, or would reasonably be expected to result in, an “Acquisition Proposal,” as defined in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation” (including
providing access to non-public information);
•
enter into, continue, engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any Acquisition Proposal; or
•
otherwise knowingly assist, participate, cooperate in or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to
make an Acquisition Proposal.
However, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if SPX FLOW receives an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not preceded by a breach of SPX FLOW's non-solicitation obligations
under the Merger Agreement, the Company may contact a person making the Acquisition Proposal solely to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof. In addition, if the Company's Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that (1) the failure to take the applicable
action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law and (2) based on the
information then available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a “Superior Proposal,” as described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation-Receipt of Acquisition
Proposals,” then the Company may:
•
provide information (including access to the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries) in
response to a request by a person making the written Acquisition Proposal, subject to specified
conditions described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; No
Solicitation-Receipt of Acquisition Proposals”; and

unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal.",17,17

SPX FLOW's Board has unanimously recommended that SPX FLOW stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger
Proposal. The Merger Agreement permits SPX FLOW's Board to effect a “Change of Recommendation” (as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation-Change of
Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) only in certain limited circumstances, as
described below. Before the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, SPX FLOW's Board may effect a Change
of Recommendation and/or terminate the Merger Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, if SPX
FLOW's Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, taking into account all adjustments to
the terms of the Merger Agreement offered by Buyer. Before effecting a Change of Recommendation or
terminating the Merger Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, (1) SPX FLOW must have given
Buyer at least five business days' prior written notice of its intention to do so (which notice shall state the
reasons therefor, including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making such
Superior Proposal and include a copy of the alternative acquisition agreement and any other relevant
transaction documents and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto), (2) SPX FLOW must
have negotiated in good faith (to the extent Buyer requests to negotiate) with Buyer during such notice
period to enable Buyer to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would cause
such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that the Company’s Board would no
longer determine that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law and (3) following the end of the notice period, the Company's
Board must have determined in good faith, taking into account any revisions to the terms of the Merger
Agreement proposed in writing by Buyer and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the
revisions proposed by Buyer were to be given effect and that failure to make such Change of
8TABLE OF CONTENTS
Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law
(provided further that each material amendment to the financial terms of the Superior Proposal will be
deemed a new Acquisition Proposal, requiring additional notice to Buyer, and SPX FLOW's Board may not
make a Change of Recommendation without offering to Buyer to negotiate for three business days from the
date of such additional notice).
See the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation-Change of Board
Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement-Termination.”
In addition, before the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, SPX FLOW's Board may effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an “Intervening Event” (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation-Change of Board Recommendation; Alternative
Acquisition Agreement”) if SPX FLOW's Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable law. Before effecting a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event, (1) SPX
FLOW must have given Buyer at least five business days’ prior written notice of its intention to do so and a
reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event that serves as a basis of the Change of
Recommendation as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of it, (2) SPX FLOW must have
negotiated in good faith (to the extent Buyer requests to negotiate) with Buyer during such notice period to
enable Buyer to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would obviate the basis
for the Change of Recommendation and (3) at the end of the notice period, SPX FLOW's Board must
determine in good faith, taking into account any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed in
writing by Buyer and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to
effect a Change of Recommendation would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law
if the changes proposed by Buyer were to be given effect (provided further that each material change to facts
and circumstances relating to the Intervening Event shall require a new notice and SPX FLOW's Board may
not make a Change of Recommendation without offering to Buyer to negotiate for three business days from
the date of such additional notice).

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the Special
Meeting and the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not
address all of the questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of the Company. Please refer to
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy
statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which you
should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You Can Find
Additional Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
A:
On December 12, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub, a
direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, with and into the Company, with the Company surviving
the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. The Merger Agreement provides for Buyer to acquire
the Company in a Merger for a price of $86.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon. You are
receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company's Board in
favor of the Merger Proposal and to approve the other related proposals to be voted on at the Special
Meeting.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will be held at SPX FLOW, Inc., 13320 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte,
North Carolina 28277, on March 3, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof). This Special Meeting will be a held in person.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only holders of record of the Company common stock as of the close of business on January 31, 2022,
the Record Date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their
shares at the Special Meeting. Each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding as of
the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote
at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve the Merger Proposal;
•
to approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and
•
to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
A:
A quorum will be present if holders of not less than one-third of the shares of the Company common
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting are present or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the chairperson of the Special Meeting has the
power to adjourn the Special Meeting without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum is present or represented.
As of the close of business on January 31, 2022, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, there were
42,058,085 shares of common stock outstanding.
If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on
the proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present
at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the Merger Proposal?
A:
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the vote of a majority of the shares of common stock
outstanding at the close of business entitled to vote on the Record Date for the Special Meeting “FOR”
the Merger Proposal.
12TABLE OF CONTENTS
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct
the nominee how to vote your shares, the failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Q:
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the remaining proposals to be voted
upon at the Special Meeting?
A:
Each of the Advisory Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company common stock present, in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote, at the Special Meeting.
An abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock
(including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. Because all proposals for the Special Meeting
are non-routine and non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes for such proposals.
Q:
How does the Company's Board recommend that I vote?
A:
Our Board unanimously recommends that SPX FLOW stockholders vote:
•
“FOR” the Merger Proposal;
•
“FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and
•
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Company's Board considered in determining to recommend the
approval of the Merger Agreement, please see the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 - The Merger-
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board.” In addition, in considering the
recommendation of our Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that some of
our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Company stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the
section entitled “Proposal No. 1 - The Merger-Interests of SPX FLOW's Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.”
Q:
How do SPX FLOW's directors and officers intend to vote?
A:
We currently expect that SPX FLOW's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of
the Merger Proposal and the other proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting, although they
have no obligation to do so.
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A:
As of the date of the filing of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger during the first
half of calendar year 2022. However, completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the completion of the Merger, which are described in this proxy statement and include
regulatory clearances, and it is possible that the Merger will not be completed until a later time, or at
all.
There may be a substantial amount of time between the Special Meeting and the completion of the
Merger. After the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, our Board will not have the right to terminate the
Merger Agreement in order to accept any Alternative Acquisition Proposal.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not approved by the Company's stockholders, or if the Merger is not
completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of
common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, SPX FLOW will remain a public company, and
shares of our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed
and traded on the NYSE. In the event that the Company fails to promptly pay the Company Termination
Fee or Buyer fails to promptly pay the Buyer Termination Fee, and in order to obtain such payment,
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a legal proceeding that
results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee, or against
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Buyer for the Buyer Termination Fee, or any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company shall pay
Buyer, or Buyer shall pay the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorney's fees) in connection with such legal proceeding (including interests) (the amounts
referred to in the foregoing, the “Collection Costs”); provided, that in no event shall the Collection Costs
exceed $10,000,000.
In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company or Buyer as a consequence of
not receiving the Requisite Company Vote, under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee
is not then payable, then the Company will reimburse Buyer and its affiliates for all of their reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to Buyer and Merger Sub and their affiliates)
incurred by Buyer or Merger Sub or on their behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and performance of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (the “Buyer Expenses”), up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000;
provided, that the payment by the Company of the Buyer Expenses pursuant to this paragraph shall not
relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee to the extent
required by the Merger Agreement. Payment of the Buyer Expenses shall be made by wire transfer of
same-day funds to the accounts designated by Buyer within two business days after the Company
received notice and documentation with respect to amounts validly due under this paragraph.
Q:
What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Common Stock?
A:
We urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and
the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger
affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you own.
Voting
Stockholders of record will be able to vote at the Special Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record,
but instead hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
nominee, you must provide a “legal proxy” executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other
nominee in order to be able to vote at the Special Meeting.
It is not necessary to attend the Special Meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your
shares of common stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting
instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting.
Attending the meeting does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.
Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder
You can also ensure that your shares are voted at the Special Meeting by submitting your proxy via:
•
mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the
enclosed postage-paid envelope;
•
telephone, by viewing the proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com and using a touch-tone
phone and the toll-free number; or
•
the Internet, at www.proxyvote.com and the 12-digit control number on the enclosed proxy
card.
The telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern
Time) on March 2, 2022.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a
proposal, your proxy will be voted “FOR” (1) the Merger Proposal, (2) the Advisory Compensation
Proposal, and (3) the Adjournment Proposal.
We encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the Special Meeting.
A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal
and on the other two proposals (assuming, in the case of a failure to vote, that a quorum is present).
Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the
directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or
other
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the
Merger Proposal, the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Can I revoke my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a
stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying SPX FLOW at SPX FLOW, Inc., 13320
Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277, Attention: Scott Gaffner, or by submitting
a new proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke
your proxy by attending the Special Meeting and voting; however, simply attending the Special Meeting
will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in “street name” and
you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the
instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If
you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting at the Special
Meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to
be able to vote at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
A:
The requisite number of shares to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares
of common stock outstanding on the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote,
or abstain from voting, on the Merger Proposal and the other two proposals, it will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” each such proposal.
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal?
A:
The inclusion of the Advisory Compensation Proposal is required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”); however, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the
completion of the Merger and the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not
be binding on SPX FLOW or Buyer. If the Merger Agreement is approved by our stockholders and the
Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation is expected to be paid to our named executive
officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if
stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Q:
Will my shares of Common Stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be
combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by
a different stockholder (that is, your custodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares
of common stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock held in “street name” will not be
combined for voting purposes with shares of common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own
shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a
trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy
card for those shares of common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership.
Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized
officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card.
Shares of common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules
governing the account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the Special Meeting, you
should read carefully any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.
Q:
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
A:
If your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will
receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy
cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the
Internet) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the Merger?
A:
In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through
completion of the Merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of common stock before completion
of the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the Merger.
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the completion
of the Merger. If you transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the closing
of the Merger, you will have the right to vote at the Special Meeting but not the right to receive the
merger consideration.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the
paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common
stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are
held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your
broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your
“street name” shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Do not send in your stock
certificates now.
Q:
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the Per Share Price for my
shares of common stock?
A:
Yes. As a holder of SPX FLOW common stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the
DGCL, in connection with the Merger if you take certain actions, meet certain conditions and fully
comply with the requirements set forth under the DGCL, including that you do not vote (in person or by
proxy) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. These procedures are summarized in the section
entitled “Appraisal Rights of SPX FLOW Stockholders.” In addition, the text of the applicable appraisal
rights provisions of Delaware law is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Failure to strictly comply with these provisions will result in the loss of appraisal rights.
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or
more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company
provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to
receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted
householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has
multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received householding notification from
your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of
this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement
promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to
household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
Q:
Where can I find more information about SPX FLOW?
A:
You can find more information about SPX FLOW from various sources described in the section entitled
“Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

"SPX FLOW, Inc._20220201_DEFM14A_19813071_4373457.Pdf",CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement, and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, include
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include any statement that is not based on
historical fact, including statements containing the words “believe,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “might,”
“possible,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate” or “continue,” and similar expressions. All
forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should
not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein
will be achieved. SPX FLOW assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for
any reason, except as required by law. In addition to other factors and matters contained in or incorporated
by reference in this document, we believe the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially
from those discussed in the forward-looking statements:
•
the failure to obtain the Requisite Company Vote;
•
the possibility that the closing conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied or waived, including
that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary regulatory approval;
•
delay in closing the transaction or the possibility that the transaction may not be completed;
•
the occurrence of any event that could give rise to termination of the Merger Agreement;
•
risks related to the disruption of the transaction to the Company and its management;
•
limitations placed on our ability to operate our business under the Merger Agreement;
•
the effect of announcement of the transaction on SPX FLOW's ability to retain and hire key
personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, subcontractors, regulators and
other third parties;
•
the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the Merger may affect the timing or
occurrence of the Merger or result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, and
risks associated with other litigation relating to our business;
•
risks relating to adverse outcomes in legal proceedings other than in connection with the Merger;
•
risks relating to changes generally affecting the nutrition health and precision solutions markets;
•
disruption of SPX FLOW's significant supplier relationships;
•
disruption in SPX FLOW's manufacturing systems; and
•
other risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended 2020, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents
filed by us with the SEC after the date thereof. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find
Additional Information.”
Because the factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf, you should not place
undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as
required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement
to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence
of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to
predict which factors will arise. In addition, the Company cannot assess the impact of each factor on its
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

At the Special Meeting, SPX FLOW stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following
proposals:
•
To approve the Merger Proposal;
•
To approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and
•
To approve the Adjournment Proposal.
Our stockholders must approve the Merger Proposal for the Merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to
approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex A, and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are described in the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
The vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal is separate and apart from the Merger Proposal.
Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal and vote not to
approve the Merger Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal is
advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either SPX FLOW or Buyer. Accordingly, if the Merger
Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation is
expected to be paid to our executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation
agreements and arrangements even if the stockholders fail to approve the proposal.
We do not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the Special Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have
discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.

The holders of not less than one-third of the shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Special
Meeting. Abstentions, withhold votes, and broker non-votes are counted as shares present and entitled to

including stockholders of record and beneficial owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a

To attend the Special Meeting in person, you must provide proof of ownership of SPX FLOW common stock
as of the close of business on the Record Date, such as an account statement indicating ownership on that
date, and a form of personal identification for admission to the meeting. If you hold your shares in “street

Alternatively, you may have your shares of SPX FLOW common stock voted in one of the following three
ways, whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting:
•
by submitting a proxy by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 and following the telephone voting
instructions printed on your proxy card;
•
by submitting a proxy over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com and following the Internet voting
instructions printed on your proxy card; or
•
by marking, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it in its accompanying
postage-paid envelope.
If you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by
11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 2, 2022.
Submitting a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail will not prevent you from voting in person at the
Special Meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail, even if
you plan to attend the Special Meeting, to ensure that your shares of SPX FLOW common stock are
represented at the Special Meeting.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted
in favor of each of the Merger Proposal, the Advisory Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment

return your proxy card and you are a holder of record on the Record Date, unless you attend the Special

If your shares of common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,”
your broker, bank or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for
your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting
instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction
form.
In accordance with the rules of NYSE, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common
stock in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect
to the Merger Proposal, the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if
brokers, banks or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions with respect to these proposals
from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with respect to these proposals.
Therefore, unless you attend the Special Meeting with a properly executed legal proxy from your broker,
bank, or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result
in your shares of SPX FLOW common stock not being voted on the Merger Proposal, the Advisory
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal and will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time
before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote
is taken at the Special Meeting by:
•
submitting a new proxy dated after the date of the proxy being revoked, by using the telephone or
internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating and
returning a new proxy card by mail to SPX FLOW, in each case, in accordance with the
instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
•
delivering to Scott Gaffner, Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Insights a signed
written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy is
revoked; or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting your shares of SPX FLOW common stock in person (your
attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must also vote in person at the
meeting).
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without
taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to
revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to SPX FLOW or by sending a written notice of revocation to
SPX FLOW, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in
sufficient time for it to be received by SPX FLOW before the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the
instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit
new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting
in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other

stockholders and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will
be merged with and into SPX FLOW, with SPX FLOW surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Buyer.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of
common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than shares held by the
Company as treasury shares, owned by Buyer or Merger Sub or held by any holders who have properly
demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262) will be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Price of $86.50, without interest, and SPX FLOW Restricted Shares, Options,

The following chronology summarizes the key events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement and
does not purport to catalogue every conversation, nor the details of every conversation, involving the Board,
the Committee (as defined below), management or other representatives of SPX FLOW and other parties.
Other than as described below and for contacts in the ordinary course of our business, there have been no
material contacts between SPX FLOW and Lone Star in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger
Agreement.
On September 26, 2015, SPX Corporation distributed 100% of the common stock of SPX FLOW to its
stockholders in a spin-off transaction (the “Spin-Off”). Since the consummation of the Spin-Off, the Board
and SPX FLOW's management have regularly reviewed SPX FLOW's business strategy and strategic plan in
light of SPX FLOW's competitive position, industry trends and other potential challenges and opportunities in
executing such business strategy and strategic plan. As part of this regular review, the Board and
management have also worked together to evaluate performance against SPX FLOW's strategic plan
(including its short- and long-term operational and stock price performance) and to identify strategic and
financial opportunities to maximize stockholder value. In addition, to assist SPX FLOW in connection with
certain strategic matters (including in connection with assisting it evaluating and responding to unsolicited
acquisition proposals), SPX FLOW retained Morgan Stanley in March of 2016 to act as its financial advisor.
Beginning in 2018, SPX FLOW initiated a focus on enhancing stockholder value by improving gross margins
and increasing recurring revenue. Consistent with these objectives, SPX FLOW conducted a detailed
strategic review of its product lines, working with an external consultant to focus on the products and market
verticals where SPX FLOW had a strong value proposition for customers and could grow profitably. This
strategic review also included a plan to focus its Food and Beverage Systems business to emphasize
process technologies with a strong value proposition to customers. The review also led the Board to the
decision to divest its former Power and Energy reportable segment business in a transaction that closed on
March 30, 2020. During 2020, SPX FLOW also launched an “80/20” initiative designed to utilize a data driven
approach to identify and focus efforts on products and customers in target markets that were likely to
generate higher growth and higher margins. These efforts, together with other initiatives, resulted in adjusted
operating margins increasing from approximately 8.1% in 2018 to approximately 11.8% for the first three
quarters of 2021, an improvement of 370 basis points.
24TABLE OF CONTENTS
In 2021, SPX FLOW remained focused on continued execution of the 80/20 initiative and other efforts
designed to further improve gross margins, including through overall enterprise productivity enhancements
and reductions in SG&A and supply chain costs.
On March 11, 2021, SPX FLOW hosted a virtual investor day in which it highlighted its three year strategic
objectives to achieve (i) low- to mid- single digit organic revenue growth, (ii) mid-teens operating income
margins and (iii) acquired revenue of $200-300 million. The investor day presentation also noted the four
foundational pillars supporting these objectives: (i) profitable growth, (ii) high return investments, (iii)
improved customer experience and (iv) strong commitment to people and culture.
On May 5, 2021, SPX FLOW announced results for its first fiscal quarter that reflected a year over year
increase in organic revenue of 19% and a significant improvement in gross margins.
In early May, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley became aware through its ongoing dialogue with
representatives of Ingersoll Rand Inc. (“Ingersoll Rand”), on an unsolicited basis, of Ingersoll Rand's possible
interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with SPX FLOW. Representatives of Morgan Stanley
updated Marcus Michael, President and Chief Executive Officer of SPX FLOW, of this information, who
subsequently updated Robert Hull, the Chairman of the Board and Peter Ryan, SPX FLOW's Chief People
Officer and General Counsel.
At the Board's regularly scheduled meeting on May 12, 2021, Mr. Michael informed the Board of the
information he had learned from representatives of Morgan Stanley about Ingersoll Rand's possible interest
in a strategic transaction and the Board authorized Mr. Michael to engage in preliminary discussions with
Ingersoll Rand in the event he was contacted by Ingersoll Rand.
On May 13, 2021 and May 14, 2021, Mr. Michael and Vincente Reynal, chief executive officer of Ingersoll
Rand, through a series of emails initiated by Mr. Reynal, arranged a lunch meeting for May 18, 2021.
At the lunch meeting on May 18, 2021, Mr. Reynal indicated that Ingersoll Rand had conducted diligence
based on publicly available information and would be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of SPX
FLOW. Mr. Michael told Mr. Reynal that he appreciated the interest and that SPX FLOW and its Board
would take seriously any opportunity to create value for SPX FLOW and its stockholders. No discussions
occurred at this meeting with respect to price, structure or any other potential terms related to a transaction.
Following the lunch meeting on May 18, 2021, Mr. Michael separately briefed Messrs. Hull and Ryan on his
conversation with Mr. Reynal. Thereafter, Mr. Ryan apprised SPX FLOW's outside counsel, Winston &
Strawn LLP (“Winston”), of the meeting between Messrs. Michael and Reynal. This discussion between Mr.
Ryan and Winston included a review of, among other things, the fiduciary duties of the Board in considering
a potential offer by Ingersoll Rand and the guidelines that management not engage in discussions with any
potential acquiror concerning post-closing compensation or equity arrangements until expressly permitted
by the Board.
On or around May 19, 2021, Mr. Michael directed Morgan Stanley to update its annual valuation materials
on the Company.
On May 22, 2021, Mr. Michael provided an oral update on his conversations with Mr. Reynal to a broader
group of directors that included Mr. Hull, David Singer and Patrick Campbell.
On May 26, 2021, Mr. Michael placed a telephone call to Mr. Reynal. During this call, Mr. Michael explained
that, as outlined in its 2021 investor day presentation and as demonstrated by its operating performance in
the first quarter, SPX FLOW had a plan to drive value creation for its stockholders and, therefore, any
proposal to acquire the Company should reflect the value of such opportunity. Mr. Reynal responded by
indicating that Ingersoll Rand was prepared to send a letter formally expressing its interest in exploring a
transaction with SPX FLOW.
Thereafter, at Mr. Michael's direction, a special meeting of the Board was scheduled for June 1, 2021, in
order to further consider the overtures made by Ingersoll Rand.
On May 27, 2021, Mr. Michael received an email from Mr. Reynal, which included a letter from Ingersoll
Rand (the “May 27 IR Proposal”). The May 27 IR Proposal set forth a valuation for SPX FLOW of $81.50 per
share in an all cash transaction. The May 27 IR Proposal was a non-binding expression of interest and
indicated that Ingersoll Rand would need four to five weeks to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive
documentation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on May 27, 2021, Mr. Michael discussed the May 27 IR Proposal with Messrs. Hull and Ryan and the
plan to include it on the agenda for the special meeting of the Board already scheduled for June 1, 2021.
Thereafter, Mr. Ryan discussed the May 27 IR Proposal with Winston, including potential responses to the
proposal and the Board's obligations with respect to the proposal.
On May 28, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Ryan held a telephone call with representatives of Morgan Stanley
in order to discuss the May 27 IR Proposal and potential responses by SPX FLOW.
On June 1, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was convened in order to consider and discuss the May 27
IR Proposal. At this meeting, Mr. Ryan led the Board in a review of materials related to corporate governance
(including that management not engage in discussions with any potential acquiror concerning post-closing
compensation or equity arrangements until expressly permitted by the Board) and the fiduciary duties of
directors in the context of an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The Board then discussed the May 27 IR
Proposal in the context of the value that could be delivered to the stockholders of SPX FLOW by continued
execution of the strategic plan and related initiatives already underway. The Board also reviewed and
discussed projections provided by SPX FLOW management and the preliminary valuation views prepared by
Morgan Stanley based on such projections. These projections included the Management Case-Long Range
Plan (as defined below), which reflect the Company achieving a target Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.0% by
2025. Based on these discussions, the Board determined that the May 27 IR Proposal undervalued SPX
FLOW and its growth prospects. Accordingly, the Board determined that the May 27 IR Proposal should be
rejected. In addition, at this special meeting the Board reviewed and approved resolutions authorizing the
formation of a strategic alternatives committee of the Board comprised of Messrs. Hull, Campbell and Singer
(with Mr. Singer serving as the chair) to facilitate review of strategic alternatives, including a potential
transaction with Ingersoll Rand (such committee, the “Committee”).
On June 2, 2022, consistent with the directive from the Board, Mr. Michael sent a response letter to Mr.
Reynal indicating that the Board had unanimously concluded that the valuation contemplated by the May 27
IR Proposal undervalued SPX FLOW and its future prospects.
On June 10, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Reynal agreed to speak on the morning of June 11, 2021.
Later on June 10, 2021, Ingersoll Rand sent SPX FLOW a second letter relating to a non-binding indication
of interest in a potential transaction (the “June 10 IR Proposal”). The June 10 IR Proposal contemplated a
valuation for SPX FLOW at $85.00 per share in an all cash transaction. The June 10 IR Proposal also
provided high-level background on Ingersoll Rand's valuation approach, indicating that from Ingersoll Rand's
perspective its offer provided SPX FLOW with full credit for the business plan outlined in its investor day
presentation and assumed that SPX FLOW could achieve the near and medium term objectives described in
that plan.
Also on June 10, 2021, Mr. Michael provided the June 10 IR Proposal to each of Messrs. Hull, Ryan and
Jaime Easley, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of SPX FLOW.
On June 11, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Reynal spoke on the telephone to discuss the June 10 IR Proposal.
During this call, Messrs. Michael and Reynal discussed the valuation contemplated by the June 10 IR
Proposal and Mr. Reynal explained the assumptions underlying such valuation. Mr. Michael indicated that
SPX FLOW would carefully review the June 10 IR Proposal and respond on a timely basis.
Also on June 11, 2021, Mr. Michael apprised each of Messrs. Hull, Easley and Ryan of his conversation with
Mr. Reynal. Thereafter, Messrs. Michael, Easley and Ryan also discussed the June 10 IR Proposal with
representatives of Morgan Stanley, who provided input on the process for any potential engagement with
Ingersoll Rand. Mr. Ryan also discussed with Winston the June 10 IR Proposal and the potential responses
to the updated proposal. Following these discussions, Mr. Michael requested a meeting of the Committee
be scheduled for June 13, 2021 in order to provide the Committee with an opportunity to review and discuss
the June 10 IR Proposal.
The Committee met on June 13, 2021. This meeting was also attended by Messrs. Michael, Easley and
Ryan. At this meeting, the Committee reviewed and discussed the June 10 IR Proposal. Discussion then
turned to the input and advice received by SPX FLOW from representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston
in respect of the unsolicited proposals from Ingersoll Rand. The Committee discussed the key elements of
SPX FLOW's valuation, assuming the continued execution of its strategic plan based on management's
projections, and also discussed potential interest in SPX FLOW from other third parties. The Committee
also discussed the potential benefits and detriments of further engagement with Ingersoll Rand. Following
such discussion, the Committee directed Mr. Michael to convey to Mr. Reynal that SPX FLOW rejected the
June 10 IR Proposal.
26
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 14, 2021, Mr. Michael had a telephone conversation with Mr. Reynal, during which he indicated that
SPX FLOW believed that the June 10 IR Proposal undervalued SPX FLOW. Mr. Michael indicated that if
Ingersoll Rand desired to receive non-public information on SPX FLOW's strategic initiatives and
opportunities, Ingersoll Rand would need to provide an offer with a higher valuation than that contemplated by
the June 10 IR Proposal. In response, Mr. Reynal agreed to review the terms of the June 10 IR Proposal
further with his executive team and advisors and indicated that he would speak again soon with Mr. Michael.
On June 15, 2021, Mr. Reynal sent Mr. Michael an email indicating that, following further internal
conversation, Ingersoll Rand's proposed valuation remained at $85.00 per share. Mr. Reynal also indicated
that, while he understood SPX FLOW's belief in its long-term plan, such plan involved a number of execution
risks and uncertainties. Mr. Reynal's email further indicated that Ingersoll Rand would not be in a position to
increase its offer any further unless non-public information provided under a non-disclosure agreement
indicated that SPX FLOW was materially ahead of plan and demonstrated an ability to drive more value than
that contemplated by the investor day presentation.
Also on June 15, 2021, Mr. Michael discussed Mr. Reynal's email with Messrs. Ryan and Easley.
Thereafter, Mr. Ryan provided Winston with a status update on the process and discussed appropriate next
steps. Following those discussions, Mr. Ryan provided an email update to the Committee.
On June 18, 2021, Mr. Michael advised Mr. Reynal in a brief telephone call that SPX FLOW would provide a
response to the June 10 IR Proposal the following week. Later on the same day, Mr. Michael provided the
Committee with another written status update. He also shared with the Committee a draft response letter to
the June 10 IR Proposal and Mr. Reynal's email on June 15, 2021. The Committee reviewed the proposed
draft response letter and the Committee confirmed agreement with the approach.
On the same day, Mr. Michael sent to Mr. Reynal a response letter to the June 10 IR Proposal and Mr.
Reynal's email on June 15, 2021. This response letter was substantially in the form previously agreed to by
the Committee. The response letter stated that the Company believed that the June 10 IR Proposal
undervalued SPX FLOW. The response letter also indicated that, in light of the valuation gap between the
parties, the Company was not willing to provide confidential information about SPX FLOW.
On June 25, 2021, Mr. Michael provided a written update to the Board detailing deliberations of the
Committee, discussions with advisors and the current status of interactions with Ingersoll Rand.
On July 17, 2021, SPX FLOW received a request for comment from The Wall Street Journal related to a
story the newspaper planned to publish relating to Ingersoll Rand's interest in SPX FLOW. Thereafter, Mr.
Michael discussed the request for comment with Messrs. Hull, Easley and Ryan. Mr. Ryan also contacted
Winston and discussed the Company's legal obligations in responding to this inquiry. Following these
discussions, SPX FLOW advised The Wall Street Journal that, as a matter of policy, the Company did not
comment on rumors and market speculation. Mr. Michael also provided the Board with a written update,
advising them of The Wall Street Journal's request for comment and the likelihood that a story would be
published with respect to Ingersoll Rand's interest in SPX FLOW.
On July 18, 2021, The Wall Street Journal published a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources,
Ingersoll Rand had made takeover bids for SPX FLOW and that the most recent all-cash offer valued SPX
FLOW “in the low $80's per share.”
On July 19, 2021, Ingersoll Rand issued a press release confirming that it had made an all-cash non-binding
proposal to acquire SPX FLOW for $85 per share and the SPX FLOW Board had rejected the proposal. The
release also stated that Ingersoll Rand “remain(s) committed to engaging with SPX FLOW” and that SPX
FLOW is a “strong strategic fit” with Ingersoll Rand. Finally, the release noted that there can be no
assurance that its proposal will result in a definitive agreement or that the proposed transaction or any other
transaction will be approved or consummated.
Also on July 19, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Easley received unsolicited telephone calls from several
stockholders regarding Ingersoll Rand's press release that, as a general matter, were supportive of the
Company pursuing a transaction at the valuation proposed by Ingersoll Rand.
On the same day, Mr. Ryan also updated the Board and the Committee and solicited input on a potential
press release to respond to Ingersoll Rand's public statement.
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following the close of trading on July 19, 2021, SPX FLOW issued a press release confirming that the
Company had rejected an unsolicited, conditional, non-binding proposal from Ingersoll Rand at $85.00 per
share. The press release noted that the Board and management team were open to all avenues to deliver
stockholder value and remained focused on sustained and profitable growth.
The Committee met on the morning of July 20, 2021. The Committee discussed the public statement by
Ingersoll Rand confirming its proposal and the unsolicited feedback from stockholders of SPX FLOW. The
Committee then discussed and considered, among other things, the communication strategy for the
earnings call scheduled for August 4, 2021, the possibility of initiating a formal outreach to potential
acquirors following such earnings call and the potential for additional unsolicited offers to be made to acquire
the Company. The Committee also directed Mr. Ryan to provide a written summary update for the full Board.
Later in the day, the chief executive officer of a publicly listed company (“Strategic Party 1”) sent Mr.
Michael an unsolicited message stating that he had been watching the news and indicating receptivity to
discussions with SPX FLOW regarding any strategic alternatives. Mr. Michael provided this message to Mr.
Ryan and discussed an appropriate response with him. Mr. Ryan then provided an email update to
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston on the unsolicited message and proposed response.
Thereafter, Mr. Michael sent a reply message to the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 1 indicating
appreciation for the outreach and that he would be in touch following the Company's earnings call.
On July 22, 2021, a long-time stockholder that indicated it beneficially owned approximately 4% of the
Company's stock, delivered an unsolicited letter to the Board. The purpose of the letter was to state
unequivocally that the stockholder would vote in favor of any offer for SPX FLOW at or above $85 and its
belief that such a price fully reflected the value of SPX FLOW as a stand-alone company. The letter also
strongly urged the Board to maximize stockholder value by publicly announcing, and immediately starting, a
formal process that included both good faith negotiations with Ingersoll Rand and a demonstration of
willingness to engage with other potential acquirors. The letter also indicated that the stockholder intended
to make the contents of its letter public by July 28, 2021, if the Company did not publicly announce a
process prior to such time.
The Committee met again on the morning of July 24, 2021, in order to discuss, among other things, the
public disclosure of Ingersoll Rand's proposal and stockholder feedback, including the stockholder letter
dated July 22, 2021. At this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley led the Committee in a discussion
of the potential benefits and challenges associated with formally announcing a review of strategic
alternatives. This discussion was followed by a review by Winston of the fiduciary duties of the Board
relating to a decision to initiate and announce a formal review of strategic alternatives. Following further
discussion on next steps, valuation matters, timing and the upcoming earnings call, the Committee agreed
to call a meeting of the full Board for the following day and directed Mr. Ryan to send an update to the full
Board summarizing the status of the Committee's deliberations.
The Board met on the morning of July 25, 2021. At the meeting, Mr. Michael provided an overview of the
press reports relating to the unsolicited proposals from Ingersoll Rand, Ingersoll Rand's public confirmation
of such proposals, the communication strategy in response thereto, feedback from stockholders of SPX
FLOW and the deliberations of the Committee with respect to the timing and announcement of a potential
review of strategic alternatives (including a possible sale transaction or a determination to continue to
execute on SPX FLOW's strategic plan). Thereafter, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Board
with their insights related to the then current circumstances, including market and investor reaction to the
disclosures of the unsolicited proposals from Ingersoll Rand. Following this discussion by Morgan Stanley,
the Board reviewed the potential benefits and challenges of initiating a formal review of a strategic review
(including a possible sale transaction or a determination to continue to execute on SPX FLOW's strategic
plan) and related public announcement. The Board also discussed valuation, how best to create a
competitive process designed to maximize stockholder value and the manner in which Ingersoll Rand would
be engaged in, and may respond to, a competitive process. Winston then provided an overview on the
Board's fiduciary duties. Following further discussion by the Board, the Board determined, based on a
variety of factors (including input from stockholders of SPX FLOW, market response and unsolicited interest
from another potential strategic acquiror) to initiate a formal review of strategic alternatives (including a
possible sale transaction or a determination to continue to execute on SPX FLOW's strategic plan) and to
make prompt public disclosure of such decision.
On July 26, 2021, SPX FLOW issued a press release announcing a review of strategic alternatives, including
a possible sale or merger of SPX FLOW or the continued execution of SPX FLOW's standalone strategy,
including its strategic plan.
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the direction of the Board, between the public announcement of the strategic review process on July
26, 2021 and the announcement of the signing of the Merger Agreement on December 13, 2021,
representatives of Morgan Stanley sought to engage 23 potential strategic parties (including Ingersoll Rand)
and eight financial parties (including Lone Star) in the exploration of a potential acquisition of SPX FLOW.
During the course of the strategic review process, eight strategic parties and seven financial parties
(including Lone Star) ultimately signed a non-disclosure agreement. Ingersoll Rand was provided a form of
the non-disclosure agreement, but did not execute, or provide comments to, the form of non-disclosure
agreement.
These non-disclosure agreements were all based on the same form non-disclosure agreement and all but
one non-disclosure agreement executed by SPX FLOW included a standstill provision. Each non-disclosure
agreement that was entered into by SPX FLOW with a standstill provision contained exceptions to the
provision, including that private, non-public discussions and proposals to the Board or the officers of SPX
FLOW were expressly permitted. The non-disclosure agreement without a standstill provision was entered
into with Strategic Party 1.
Throughout the month of August, SPX FLOW and its advisors engaged in intensive work on the confidential
presentation materials and sell-side due diligence efforts (including the population of a virtual data room).
On August 16, 2021, Mr. Ryan placed a phone call and sent an email to the general counsel of Ingersoll
Rand regarding Ingersoll Rand's potential interest in participating in the strategic review process, but
received no immediate response to either communication.
On August 18, 2021 and August 19, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting via
videoconference. This Board meeting included an update from representatives of Morgan Stanley on the
status of the strategic review process, including the various parties that expressed interest and those parties
that declined to participate in the strategic review process and an illustrative timeline for the strategic review
process.
On August 24, 2021, Mr. Michael invited Mr. Reynal to a lunch meeting.
On August 25, 2021, Mr. Reynal told Mr. Michael that Ingersoll Rand was still evaluating next steps with its
board of directors. Mr. Reynal noted that he expected to have an update by August 31 and that he would
reach-out at that time. Mr. Michael suggested an in-person meeting, but did not receive a response from Mr.
Reynal.
Between August 26, 2021 and August 31, 2021, management continued to work with the Company's
advisors to finalize key documents for the strategic review process, including the management presentation
and process letter. Drafts of the management presentation were also provided to the Board and to the
Committee. In addition, Mr. Michael provided the Committee with a written update regarding prospective
purchasers interested in participating in the strategic review process.
On August 31, 2021, at the direction of the Committee, Morgan Stanley delivered a process letter to
prospective acquirors then participating in the strategic review process. This process letter requested that an
initial indication of interest be delivered by the end of September, which was in advance of the Board's next
scheduled meeting. The prospective acquirors were requested to provide, among other things, a proposed
valuation for SPX FLOW on a price per share basis, the assumptions underlying such valuation and the form
of merger consideration to be delivered. In addition, the process letter requested that bidders identify
proposed financing sources and the time required to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive
agreements. The process letter indicated that, following the submissions of the indications of interest, a
limited number of parties would be selected to move on to the second stage of the transaction process (at
which time additional guidance would be provided to prospective acquirors).
On September 1, 2021, management of SPX FLOW delivered its first management presentation to a
prospective acquiror in connection with the strategic review process. During the course of the strategic
review process, six parties (including two strategic parties and four financial parties) engaged in virtual or in-
person meetings with the SPX FLOW management team.
Also on September 1, 2021, Ingersoll Rand issued a press release stating that Ingersoll Rand would not
participate in SPX FLOW's strategic review process. Mr. Reynal wrote Mr. Michael contemporaneously with
the issuance of the press release and provided the same message. Mr. Michael responded by indicating
that SPX FLOW remained available to engage with Ingersoll Rand if Ingersoll Rand decided to reengage.
Thereafter, Mr. Ryan provided the Board with a written update summarizing the Ingersoll press release and
the communications between Messrs. Reynal and Michael.
29
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 3, 2021, a virtual data room was opened to prospective acquirors. During the course of the
strategic review process, six parties (including one strategic party and five financial parties) were provided
access to the virtual data room.
On September 9, 2021, while SPX FLOW management continued to meet with prospective acquirors,
representatives of Morgan Stanley received a verbal indication from Strategic Party 1 regarding potential
interest in an alternative to a sale of SPX FLOW, whereby Strategic Party 1 would contribute certain
business divisions into SPX FLOW in exchange for stock in SPX FLOW. The assets proposed to be
contributed were non-core to SPX FLOW and inconsistent with the Company's strategic plan. Strategic
Party 1 did not ultimately provide a formal indication of interest with respect to the above described proposal
or an acquisition of SPX FLOW.
On September 11, 2021, the Committee met. During this meeting, the Committee discussed, among other
things, the announcement by Ingersoll Rand that it would not participate in the strategic review process and
the status of ongoing meetings with prospective acquirors (including the verbal indication of interest from
Strategic Party 1). In addition, the Committee also discussed the agenda for the regularly scheduled Board
meetings at the end of September, including SPX FLOW's strategic plan, valuation and matters related to
the strategic review process.
On September 21, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board a relationship disclosure
memo.
On September 27, 2021, a private equity fund (“Financial Party 1”) submitted a non-binding indication of
interest that valued SPX FLOW at between $85.00 and $87.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. Key
assumptions underlying this indication of interest included: (i) that the historical and 2021E EBITDA provided
for review of the prospective acquirors reflected the maintainable GAAP earnings base of the business, and
(ii) management's forecast for 2021 and 2022 was achievable. The indication of interest from Financial Party
1 did not include any information on its plans or proposals for management compensation arrangements.
Financial Party 1's indication of interest did not indicate how long it would need in order to complete due
diligence on, and reach a definitive agreement with, SPX FLOW.
On September 28, 2021, Lone Star submitted a non-binding indication of interest that valued SPX FLOW at
$85.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. Key assumptions underlying this indication of interest included:
(i) 2021 outlook and performance, including an assumption of adjusted 2021 run-rate EBITDA being in
excess of $310 million (excluding public company costs and non-cash corporate expenses), and (ii)
confirmation of the Company's ability to execute against the longer term strategic plan. The indication of
interest from Lone Star did not include any information on its plans or proposals for management
compensation arrangements. Lone Star's indication of interest did not indicate how long it would need in
order to complete due diligence on, and reach a definitive agreement with, SPX FLOW.
On September 28, 2021 and September 29, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. These
meetings included discussions of, among other things, the status of the strategic review process. In
particular, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the status of the strategic review process, including
the status of discussions with prospective acquirors and a review of the preliminary valuation analysis with
respect to various strategic alternatives. Mr. Easley presented on the Management Case-Long Range Plan
and valuation of the Company. Thereafter, Winston reviewed, among other things, the fiduciary duties of the
Board in connection with the strategic review process.
Also on September 29, 2021, SPX FLOW learned that a strategic party (“Strategic Party 2”) had determined
to withdraw from the process following review of the potential transaction with its board of directors.
No strategic parties remained involved in the strategic review process following the withdrawal of Strategic
Party 2. Other than Financial Party 1 and Lone Star, no other party submitted an indication of interest.
Following submissions of the indications of interest by Financial Party 1 and Lone Star, each of Financial
Party 1 and Lone Star were directed to continue their due diligence efforts and provide an update to their
indication of interest in advance of the Board's next scheduled meeting on November 1, 2021. Morgan
Stanley requested that the updated proposal focus on valuation, sources and uses (including detailed
information on the status of discussions with debt financing sources), remaining diligence and work-streams
and time required to reach a signed transaction.
On October 12, 2021, SPX FLOW hosted in-person meetings with representatives of Lone Star in the
Company's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Representatives from SPX FLOW in
attendance at this meeting included Messrs. Michael, Easley, Ryan and Tyrone Jeffers, Vice President,
Global Manufacturing and Supply Chain for SPX FLOW along with representatives from Morgan Stanley. The
meeting agenda included a review of the history of the SPX FLOW business, market dynamics and trends,
go-to-market model and strategy, and 2021 and multi-year operational expectations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On the same day and following the in-person October 12, 2021 meeting, Messrs. Michael and Easley and
representatives from Lone Star attended a dinner meeting together along with representatives from Morgan
Stanley. During this dinner the group discussed their personal experiences relative to business as well as
Lone Star's experience as an owner of operating companies.
On October 20, 2021 and October 21, 2021, representatives from Lone Star conducted site visits to SPX
FLOW's Rockford, IL and Delavan, WI facilities. Representatives in attendance at these site visits from SPX
FLOW included Messrs. Michael and Jeffers along with representatives from Morgan Stanley. During the site
visits, the parties also discussed Lone Star's observations regarding SPX FLOW's end markets, key product
lines and operating structure.
On October 22, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board an updated relationship
disclosure memo.
On October 25, 2021, a letter was delivered to the Board by a stockholder of SPX FLOW. The letter stated,
among other things, the stockholder's belief that a sale transaction would be in the best interests of SPX
FLOW and its stockholders. The letter also indicated the stockholder's belief that management's long-term
vision and plan for SPX FLOW, as articulated at the investor day presentation, were viewed by the
investment community as aggressive and subject to significant execution risk, the result of which was that
market participants were applying significant risk-weighted adjustments to management's forecasts. The
letter stated that such doubt held within the investment community would continue to limit the potential for
value creation on a standalone basis.
On the same day, Mr. Ryan provided the Committee with a written summary and copy of the stockholder
letter.
On October 27, 2021, Financial Party 1 indicated that it would not submit an updated bid and would be
withdrawing from the process.
On October 28, 2021, Lone Star submitted an updated proposal reaffirming its interest in acquiring SPX
FLOW in an all cash transaction that valued SPX FLOW at $85.00 per share. Lone Star's updated proposal
indicated that threshold commercial, business and industry diligence was completed and that remaining
diligence would be focused on: (i) the near-term free cash flow profile and liquidity of SPX FLOW, and (ii)
completion of customary confirmatory diligence (and the issuance of due diligence reports) by third party
advisors. Lone Star's proposal included a detailed sources and uses for the proposed transaction, which did
not contemplate any rollover by management (and no other terms were otherwise provided in the updated
proposal regarding Lone Star's plans with respect to management). The proposal concluded with a
statement that Lone Star was confident in its ability to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive
agreements within a period of 30 days.
On the same day, Messrs. Michael, Easley and Ryan met with representatives of Morgan Stanley in order
to review the updated proposal submitted by Lone Star, the withdrawal from the process by Financial Party
1, the stockholder letter received October 25, 2021 and potential next steps with respect to the strategic
review process.
On October 29, 2021, the Committee met in order to, among other things, review the status of the strategic
review process and to discuss the stockholder letter received on October 25, 2021. At the meeting, the
Committee engaged in a detailed review of Lone Star's diligence efforts to date, the updated proposal
submitted by Lone Star on October 28, 2021 and valuation analysis of the Company. Following these
discussions, the Committee determined to proceed with a final stage of due diligence and engagement with
Lone Star, with the objective of finalizing terms for the Board's consideration prior to its regularly scheduled
meeting in December. In addition, the Committee then considered the possibility of having Mr. Michael reach
out to Strategic Party 2 to discuss its potential interest in re-engaging in the process.
On November 1, 2021, the Board met in order to, among other things, review the status of the strategic
review process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the status of Lone Star's engagement with
the sale process and provided an overview of Lone Star's updated proposal. The representatives of Morgan
Stanley also provided a preliminary analysis of the Lone Star proposal from a valuation perspective, including
a review of the proposal based on comparable transactions. The Board also reviewed and discussed
projections provided by SPX FLOW management and the valuation views prepared by Morgan Stanley based
on such projections. These projections included (i) the Management Case-Long Range Plan, and (ii) the
Management Case-Adjusted, which was developed by management at the direction of the Board in order to
reflect cost saving and other initiatives only to the extent already substantially implemented and reflected
the Company achieving a target Adjusted EBITDA margin of only 22.0% by 2025. Winston then provided an
overview on the fiduciary duties of the Board in considering Lone Star's updated
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
proposal. The Board then discussed next steps in connection with Lone Star's updated indication of interest
and the timeline required in order to obtain an actionable binding offer.
On November 5, 2021, Winston provided a draft of the Merger Agreement to Lone Star's counsel, Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher LLP (“Gibson”).
On November 11, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Ryan met with representatives of Morgan Stanley following
SPX FLOW's earnings call for its third quarter. This meeting included a discussion on feedback received
from stockholders. In addition, the participants on the call considered the merits of reaching out to Strategic
Party 2 to discuss potential interest in re-engaging in the process. Following this discussion, it was
determined that Mr. Michael would reach out to the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2 in order to
determine whether Strategic Party 2 was interested in re-engaging.
Over the course of November 18, 2021 and November 19, 2021, representatives of Lone Star and
representatives of SPX FLOW management participated in due diligence sessions held in person at the
Company's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina and held dinner meetings. Representatives of
Morgan Stanley were also present at these due diligence sessions and dinner meetings.
On November 23, 2021, Mr. Michael spoke with the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2. The chief
executive officer of Strategic Party 2 indicated that he did not believe there was any change in its position,
but he would follow-up with Mr. Michael.
Also on November 23, 2021, Gibson provided Winston with a detailed markup on the draft Merger
Agreement. These comments included, among other things, the following:
•
The addition of a requirement that SPX FLOW cooperate in good faith and use commercially
reasonable efforts to repatriate cash, as requested by Lone Star, to the United States from any
foreign jurisdiction in as tax- and cost-efficient a manner as reasonably practicable, with a view to
maximizing the amount of SPX FLOW's cash held in the United States (and including a cap on the
amount of cash permitted to be held in the People's Republic of China as of the closing date);
•
The addition of a marketing period for the debt financing that would not commence until closing
conditions are satisfied (other than those that can only be satisfied at closing), the Required
Information (as defined therein) has been delivered and 20 business days (without counting
blackout periods) have elapsed;
•
The removal of the requirement for Lone Star to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter in the event of a breach by the lenders;
•
The addition of a prohibition on the Company paying dividends to its stockholders after signing of
the Merger Agreement;
•
The proposed treatment of all outstanding performance-based restricted stock units to vest at the
target level of performance set forth in each award agreement;
•
An increase of the company termination fee from 2% to 4% of the equity value of the transaction
and the addition of a requirement that such fee be payable (a) upon termination of the Merger
Agreement by Lone Star following a change of recommendation by the Board or (b) in the event
that the stockholder vote fails to pass following such a change of recommendation;
•
An additional termination fee payable by SPX FLOW equal to 1% of the equity value of the
transaction in the event that SPX FLOW failed to secure stockholder approval for the transaction;
and
•
A reduction of the termination fee payable by buyer from 10% to 4% of the equity value of the
transaction and the addition of language providing that such buyer termination fee would be the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy in the event of a debt financing failure or any other breach
under the Merger Agreement.
Also on November 23, 2021, there was an increase in buying activity in the stock of SPX FLOW that
appeared to coincide with inaccurate reports relating to the strategic review process undertaken by the
Company, including inaccurate reports that the Company had received offers as part of its process that
valued the Company at $97 per share of SPX FLOW common stock. Following discussions with
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston, SPX FLOW management provided the Committee with a
written update on such activity. The Committee, after reviewing the update provided by SPX FLOW
management, determined that, consistent with the Company's established policy, SPX FLOW should not
respond to the reports.
32
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 24, 2021, SPX FLOW management provided a written update to the Board on the
unsubstantiated takeover rumors.
On November 29, 2021, Winston and Gibson met by videoconference to review open issues related to
Gibson's markup of the Merger Agreement. Winston focused its feedback on key issues, including the
marketing period for Lone Star's debt financing, the requirement for Lone Star to enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Company's ability to continue paying dividends to its stockholders after the
signing of the Merger Agreement, amounts and triggers for each party's terminations fees, the treatment of
the outstanding performance-based restricted stock units and the repatriation of foreign cash.
On November 30, 2021, the Committee met. At this meeting, Mr. Michael provided the Committee with an
update on the status of the strategic review process. Thereafter, the Committee engaged in discussion on
the key issues currently under negotiation with Lone Star and key workstreams required to be completed in
advance of the Committee's upcoming meeting on December 7, 2021 and the Board's meeting on December
8.
On December 1, 2021, Gibson sent Winston a draft of Lone Star’s Debt Commitment Letter that was
contemplated by the proposed Merger Agreement. This Debt Commitment Letter was provided by
creditworthy lending institutions and was assessed to be on customary terms and conditions for a
transaction of this kind.
Also on December 1, 2021, Winston sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson. Over the
course of the next week, in advance of the scheduled meetings of the Committee and the Board, Winston
and Gibson met by videoconference on a number of occasions and exchanged three further drafts of the
Merger Agreement, with negotiations focusing on the key areas highlighted on the November 29, 2021
videoconference call between Winston and Gibson.
In addition, on December 4, 2021, Gibson provided Winston with initial drafts of the Equity Commitment
Letter and Limited Guarantee contemplated by the proposed Merger Agreement with Lone Star. In advance
of the scheduled meetings of the Committee and the Board, Winston and Gibson exchanged two further
drafts of these documents.
On December 7, 2021, Lone Star submitted an updated proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of SPX FLOW for cash consideration of $85 per share. At the time Lone Star submitted its
updated proposal on December 7, 2021, the following material open issues remained unresolved in the
Merger Agreement:
•
Whether or not Lone Star would be expressly required to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter in the event of a breach by the lenders;
•
Whether or not the Company would be entitled to continue paying dividends to its stockholders
after signing of the Merger Agreement;
•
The vesting treatment of the outstanding performance-based restricted stock units;
•
The amount of the company termination fee, with Lone Star proposing 3.25% and the Company
proposing 2.75%, in each case of the equity value of the transaction; and
•
The requirement that the Company reimburse buyer's expenses of up to $10 million in the event
that the Company failed to secure stockholder approval for the transaction.
At 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the same day, the Committee convened to review the proposal from Lone
Star. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Committee with a review of the updated proposal and
preliminary valuation analysis related thereto. The Committee then engaged in discussion with respect to
the updated proposal. The discussion focused on, among other things, the potential impact on the market
price for SPX FLOW common stock in the event it was announced that SPX FLOW would terminate the
strategic review process and continue the pursuit of its strategic plan on a standalone basis. The Committee
also discussed the possible stockholder reaction to such an announcement. Winston then summarized the
terms of the Merger Agreement and the key open issues remaining in the Merger Agreement.
Also on December 7, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Board with an updated
relationship disclosure memo.
On December 8, 2021, the Board convened a regularly scheduled meeting, which included a review and
discussion of the updated proposal from Lone Star. During the meeting, Mr. Singer led the Board in a
comprehensive update regarding the status of the proposed transaction. The Board discussed the history of
the strategic review process, insights related to valuation derived from the process and the deliberations of
the Committee related to potential
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
next steps. The Board discussed the price offered by Lone Star, SPX FLOW's strategic plan and prospects
on a standalone basis and unsolicited feedback provided by the Company's stockholders on the strategic
review process. During the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley led a discussion on the preliminary
valuation of SPX FLOW. Next, Winston summarized the key legal terms contemplated by the latest Lone
Star bid and the fiduciary duties of the Board in connection with its consideration of the updated proposal.
Following these deliberations, the Board determined to make a counter-offer to Lone Star.
During the evening of December 8, 2021, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley
presented Lone Star with a counteroffer of $88 per share.
On December 9, 2021, Lone Star responded that it was willing to increase its offer to $86.50 per share and
signaled a willingness to resolve other open contractual issues in a reasonable manner.
Later on the same day, Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the Board, discussed with representatives of
Lone Star whether it could increase its price further. Lone Star, however, indicated that the $86.50 counter-
offer was its best and final offer. Mr. Ryan reviewed this counter-offer with Mr. Singer, who then conducted
one-on-one telephone calls with each of the directors during the evening of December 9, 2021 and the
morning of December 10, 2021.
On the morning of December 10, 2021, Mr. Michael and the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2 had a
telephone conversation in which the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2 indicated that Strategic Party
2 was not interested in reengaging in the strategic review process.
Also, on the morning of December 10, 2021, after Mr. Singer had completed his discussions with the
directors, Mr. Singer advised Mr. Ryan that the Company and its advisors should work to finalize all
remaining issues in the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents, with a view to submitting
them for formal Board approval on December 12, 2021.
Between December 10, 2021 and December 12, 2021, Winston and Gibson engaged in extensive
videoconferences and telephonic meetings in order to review and discuss the remaining open issues in the
Merger Agreement and other transaction documents. Over these same days Winston and Gibson
exchanged seven drafts of the Merger Agreement along with several drafts of the Equity Commitment Letter
and Limited Guarantee. The terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee were agreed to
on December 11, 2021, with the Merger Agreement reaching executable form on December 12, 2021.
At 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on December 12, 2021, the Board convened a special meeting via
videoconference with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston in attendance. Representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board certain financial analyses. Winston provided an overview of the
Board's fiduciary duties in the context of a change of control and the terms of the Merger Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee. The Morgan Stanley
representatives then rendered Morgan Stanley's oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing,
to the Board that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
SPX FLOW common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
holders of shares of SPX FLOW common stock. Following discussion, the Board unanimously determined
that the transaction proposed by Lone Star was fair to, and in the best interests of, SPX FLOW and its
stockholders, unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and authorized SPX FLOW to enter into the
Merger Agreement and related transaction documents. In addition, the treatment of equity incentive awards
contemplated by the Merger Agreement were considered and approved by the Compensation & Human
Capital Management Committee of the Board.
In the early evening of December 12, 2021, the parties executed the Merger Agreement and related
transaction documents. On the morning of December 13, 2021, SPX FLOW issued a press release
announcing the transaction.",33,43
"SPX FLOW, Inc._20220201_DEFM14A_19813071_4373457.Pdf",Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board,"Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board
The Board unanimously recommends that the SPX FLOW stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal at
the Special Meeting.
The Board, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, evaluated the Merger Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, unanimously determined that
the Merger is fair to,
34TABLE OF CONTENTS
and in the best interests of, SPX FLOW and its stockholders, unanimously approved and declared advisable
the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
authorized SPX FLOW to enter into the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, on December 12, 2021, the Board
unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of SPX FLOW approve the Merger Proposal.
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board considered the following material factors relating to
the Merger Agreement and the Merger, each of which the Board believes supported its decision (not
necessarily in order of relative importance):
•
its belief, based on discussions and negotiations by SPX FLOW's senior management and
advisors with Buyer and other potentially interested parties, that (i) stockholder value will be
maximized through a sale of the entire business, and (ii) the merger consideration (which Buyer
increased from an initial $85 per share of SPX FLOW common stock to the final $86.50 per share
of SPX FLOW common stock during the course of negotiations, as described in the section
entitled “-Background to the Merger” beginning on page 24 of this proxy statement) was the highest
value reasonably attainable for SPX FLOW's stockholders on the date the Merger Agreement was
signed;
•
the fact that the Per Share Price represents:
an implied premium of 39.3% versus the unaffected closing share price of $62.09 as of July
16, 2021 (the last trading day before the Wall Street Journal story reporting on Ingersoll Rand's
offer to purchase SPX FLOW);
an implied premium of 20.8% versus the unaffected 52-week high closing share price of $71.62
as of May 10, 2021 (the highest closing share price during the 52-week trading period prior to
the Wall Street Journal story reporting on Ingersoll Rands's offer to purchase SPX FLOW);
an implied premium of 1.0% versus the closing share price of $85.63 on December 10, 2021;
an implied multiple of 16.8 times SPX FLOW's estimated earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as “EBITDA” in this proxy statement, for the
year ended December 31, 2021 and 12.2 times SPX FLOW's estimated EBITDA for the year
ended December 31, 2022;
•
the Forecasted Financial Information prepared by SPX FLOW's management and other current
information regarding (i) SPX FLOW's business, prospects, financial condition, operations,
technology, products, services, management, competitive position and strategic business goals
and objectives, (ii) general economic, industry, financial market and M&A market conditions, and
(iii) opportunities and competitive factors within SPX FLOW's industry;
•
the prospects and likelihood of realizing superior benefits through remaining an independent
company, risks associated with remaining an independent company, and possible alternative
business strategies;
•
the potential for other third parties to enter into strategic relationships with or to seek to acquire
SPX FLOW, particularly following the public announcement on July 26, 2021 of the decision by the
SPX FLOW Board to review strategic alternatives, a review of management's and Morgan Stanley's
dealings with other possible buyers in connection with the process initiated following such
announcement, the feedback received in the course of such process, and the likelihood that a third
party would offer a higher price than the Per Share Price contemplated by the proposed
transaction;
•
the timing of the Merger and the risk that if SPX FLOW does not accept an offer now (as provided
for in the Merger Agreement), it may not have another opportunity to do so or a comparable
opportunity;
•
the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, which was subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written
opinion, dated December 12, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject
to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written
opinion, the Per Share Price of SPX FLOW common stock in cash to be received by the holders of
shares of SPX FLOW common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to such holders of shares of SPX FLOW common stock, as more fully described
below under the heading “Opinion of Morgan Stanley.”

negotiations with third parties regarding unsolicited acquisition proposals following the
execution of the Merger Agreement;

deter third parties from making a Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement's terms
and conditions as they relate to the ability to make changes in the recommendation of the

SPX FLOW's ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior
Proposal, subject to paying Buyer a termination fee and complying with the other conditions of

obtain key approvals, including in particular, antitrust approvals; and
•
that the Merger will only be consummated if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of SPX FLOW entitled to vote.
In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board also considered the risks and potentially negative
factors relating to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including:
•
that SPX FLOW stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of SPX FLOW
and will not benefit from any appreciations in the value of SPX FLOW, including any future
appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of the combination of SPX FLOW with
Merger Sub;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed unless and until certain specified conditions are
satisfied or waived;
•

•
the effect of the resulting public announcement of a termination of the Merger Agreement on the
trading price of SPX FLOW's common stock if such termination were to occur;

that the offer price under the Merger Agreement does not represent a substantial premium above
SPX FLOW's current stock price;
•
that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, SPX FLOW is unable to solicit other Acquisition
Proposals during the pendency of the Merger;
•
the obligations on the conduct of SPX FLOW's business prior to the consummation of the Merger,

the requirement that SPX FLOW pay Buyer a termination fee and/or reimburse certain of Buyer's
expenses under certain circumstances following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if
the SPX FLOW Board changes its recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement or
terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal from another party or SPX
FLOW's stockholders vote against the consummation of the Merger;
•
that there is risk that if the Merger Agreement is terminated, it may be terminated in

the requirement that the Merger will only be consummated if the Merger Agreement is adopted by
the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of SPX FLOW entitled

the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and
completing the Merger, and the substantial time and effort of SPX FLOW's management required to
complete the Merger, which may disrupt SPX FLOW's business operations;
•
that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to complete the Merger, may
cause substantial harm to SPX FLOW's business, sales operations, financial results and the
Company's relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain
key personnel and the possible loss of key management, sales and other personnel), vendors,
customers and other partners, and may divert management and employees attention away from
SPX FLOW's day-to-day business operations and its current strategic plan;
•
the fact that the transaction has a potential Outside Date of September 12, 2022 and
consequently, SPX FLOW stockholders could be asked to vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement well in advance of completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, depending on when the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement close;
•
that SPX FLOW's directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, those of SPX FLOW's other stockholders;
•
the other potential strategic alternatives available to SPX FLOW, some of which could result in a
more successful and valuable company; and
•
that receipt of the merger consideration will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board includes the
material factors considered by the Board but does not necessarily include all of the factors
considered by the Board. In view of the complexity and variety of factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable
to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given
different weights to different factors. The Board unanimously resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of SPX FLOW approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement based upon the totality
of information it considered.",43,46
"SPX FLOW, Inc._20220201_DEFM14A_19813071_4373457.Pdf",Certain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,"Certain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
As part of its annual strategic planning process, SPX FLOW management prepares an internal long-range
financial plan containing certain non-public unaudited prospective financial information with respect to SPX
FLOW on a standalone basis, together with certain extrapolations of such prospective financial information
for certain fiscal years. At the direction of SPX FLOW's Board, the Company prepared projections for fiscal
years 2021 through 2025, which reflect the Company achieving a target Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.0%
by 2025E and are substantially similar to the projections provided to prospective buyers (the “Management
Case-Long Range Plan”). The Management Case-Long Range Plan assumes share repurchases of $37
million in 2021 and $25 million annually in 2022 through 2025, and annual dividends of $15 million from 2022
through 2025. In connection with the Merger and at the direction of the Board, the Company's management
also prepared projections, which are consistent with the Management Case-Long Range Plan, but reflect the
Company achieving a target Adjusted EBITDA margin of only 22.0% by 2025E (the “Management Case-
Adjusted” together with the Management Case-Long Range Plan, the “Management Cases”). The
Management Case-Adjusted was not provided to prospective buyers and was used solely for purposes of the
Board's review and analysis of the Merger. SPX FLOW management also approved for use certain publicly
37TABLE OF CONTENTS
available analyst consensus “street estimates” for SPX FLOW through 2023 and extrapolated such
estimates for fiscal years 2024 to 2025 (the “Street Consensus Forecasted Financial Information”). The
Street Consensus Forecasted Financial Information assumes no further acquisitions, share repurchases or
dividends consistent with the Management Cases and reflects the Company achieving an Adjusted EBITDA
margin of 20.6% in 2025E. Finally, SPX FLOW management also approved for use certain projections based
on SPX FLOW management's public disclosures (the “Public Guidance Forecasted Financial Information,”
and, together with the Street Consensus Forecasted Financial Information and Management Cases, the
“Forecasted Financial Information”). The Public Guidance Forecasted Financial Information assumes mid-
single digits organic revenue growth, similar margin as the Street Consensus Forecasted Financial
Information and $150 million in incremental revenue by 2023. The Forecasted Financial Information was
provided to the Company's Board and the Company's financial advisor in connection with their respective
consideration and evaluation of the Merger.
The Company does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance for extended
periods beyond one fiscal year due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting
financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates.
However, the Company is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited
prospective financial information for the Company, without giving effect to the Merger, solely to give Company
stockholders access to certain nonpublic information provided to the Company's Board, the Company's
financial advisor and Lone Star for purposes of considering and evaluating the Merger. The inclusion of the
Forecasted Financial Information in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the
Company, the Company's Board, Lone Star or any of their respective representatives or any other recipient
of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results
or an accurate prediction of future results, and the Forecasted Financial Information should not be relied on
as such.
The Forecasted Financial Information, and the underlying assumptions upon which the Forecasted Financial
Information was based, are subjective in many respects, and subject to different interpretations and potential
revisions attributable to the nature of SPX FLOW's industry in which it operates, as well as actual
experience and business developments. While presented with numerical specificity, the Forecasted
Financial Information constitutes “forward-looking statements” and reflects numerous assumptions with
respect to company performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market
and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant
economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond the Company's control. Multiple factors, including those
described in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” could
cause the Forecasted Financial Information or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result,
there can be no assurance that the Forecasted Financial Information will be realized or that actual results
will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. Because the Forecasted Financial Information covers
multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year.
The Forecasted Financial Information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change and, in many respects, personal judgement, and this is susceptible to multiple
interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. Neither SPX
FLOW nor its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can give assurance that the
Forecasted Financial Information and the underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. This
Forecasted Financial Information constitutes “forward-looking statements” and actual results may differ
materially and adversely from those set forth below. Economic and business environments can and do
change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed
in the Forecasted Financial Information will be achieved. The inclusion of the Forecasted Financial
Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by the Company or
any other person that the information is material.
The summary of the Forecasted Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement solely for
informational purposes only and is not provided to influence Company stockholders' decisions regarding
whether to vote for the Merger Proposal or any other proposal.
The Forecasted Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward
compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC
or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of prospective financial information. The Forecasted Financial Information included in this proxy
statement has been prepared at the direction of, and is the responsibility of, management of SPX FLOW.
Neither Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte & Touche”), the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Forecasted Financial Information, and
accordingly, the Deloitte & Touche does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The Deloitte & Touche report contained in SPX FLOW's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to the Company's
historical financial information. It does not extend to the Forecasted Financial Information and should not be
read to do so.
The following tables reflect selected metrics reflected in, or generated from, the Forecasted Financial
Information, which do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they
were prepared, do not take into account any potential cost synergies or revenue opportunities arising out of
the Merger, and do not give effect to the Merger. Further, the Forecasted Financial Information does not take
into account the effect on SPX FLOW of any possible failure of the Merger to occur. Neither SPX FLOW nor
any of its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in
the future to make any representation to any SPX FLOW stockholder or other person regarding SPX
FLOW's ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Forecasted Financial
Information or that the Forecasted Financial Information will be achieved.

This Non-GAAP measure is different from measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable
to similar measures used by other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net
income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow or as a measure of liquidity.
The Forecasted Financial Information includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in
accordance with GAAP and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an
additional tool for stockholders to use in evaluating the Company's potential future operating results and
trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to,
financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that forward-looking non-GAAP
financial measures are provided, they are presented on a non-GAAP basis without reconciliations of such
forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures due to the inherent difficulty
in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation.
The Forecasted Financial Information does not take into account the possible financial and other effects on
the Company of the Merger and do not attempt to predict or suggest future results of the combined
company. The Forecasted Financial Information does not give effect to the Merger, including the impact of
negotiating or executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with
consummating the Merger, the effect on the Company of any business or strategic decision or action that
has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed, or the effect of any
business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had
not been executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the
Merger. Further, the Forecasted Financial Information does not take into account the effect on the Company
of any possible failure of the Merger to occur.
For the foregoing reasons and considering that the Special Meeting will be held several months after the
Forecasted Financial Information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting
information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the
Forecasted Financial Information set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any
stockholder regarding the information included in the Forecasted Financial Information. The Company urges
all Company stockholders to review its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial
results. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”",46,49

the Forecasted Financial Information, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the Company's management of the
future financial performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,
amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Buyer will obtain
financing required to consummate the Merger and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any
material respect from the draft furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection
with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for
the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Morgan

Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion dated December 12, 2021. The following
summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley's opinion or the financial analyses performed and
factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at
its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis described below. Considering any portion of such analyses and factors considered,
without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying Morgan Stanley's opinion. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market
data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 10, 2021, the last trading day prior to the
date of the meeting of the Board at which Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion. Capitalization
information for SPX FLOW, including fully diluted number of shares, was provided on December 12, 2021 by
SPX FLOW management to Morgan Stanley, and were approved by SPX FLOW management for Morgan
Stanley's use in its financial analyses.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used
and relied upon the following financial projections: (i) the Street Consensus Forecasted Financial
Information, as more fully described above under “Certain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information,” (ii) the Public Guidance Forecasted Financial Information, as more fully described above under
“Certain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, (iii) the Management Case-Adjusted, as
more fully described above under “Certain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, and (iv)
the Management Case-Long Range Plan, as more fully described above under “Certain SPX FLOW
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, which were approved by SPX FLOW management for Morgan
Stanley's use in connection with its financial analyses.
Historical Trading Range Analysis
Morgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading range of shares of SPX FLOW common stock for the 52-
week period ending December 10, 2021 and noted that, during such period, the maximum stock price for
shares of SPX FLOW common stock was $88.55 (maximum closing trading price was $87.15), which was
also an all-time high as of December 10, 2021, the minimum stock price for shares of SPX FLOW common
stock was $52.30 (minimum closing trading price was $52.97), and the unaffected all-time maximum stock
price for shares of SPX FLOW common stock prior to The Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting
that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover bids for SPX FLOW, was $71.62
(and unaffected all-time maximum closing trading price was $70.60). Morgan Stanley also noted that the
closing trading price for shares of SPX FLOW common stock on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to
The Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had
made takeover bids for SPX FLOW, was $62.09.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed the undiscounted unaffected price targets for shares of SPX common stock
prepared and published by equity research analysts that had been published by Bloomberg as of July 16,
2021, the last trading day prior to The Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to
unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover bids for SPX FLOW. These targets generally reflect
each analyst's estimate of the future public market trading price of shares of SPX FLOW common stock. In
order to better compare the equity research analysts' stock price targets with the Per Share Price, based on
its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley discounted each analyst's price target to present
value assuming a cost of equity of 9.3%. This analysis resulted in a discounted analyst unaffected price
target range for SPX FLOW common stock of $61.00 to $82.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
Morgan Stanley also reviewed the undiscounted current price targets for shares of SPX common stock
prepared and published by equity research analysts that had been published by Bloomberg as of December
10, 2021. In order to
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
better compare the equity research analysts' stock price targets with the Per Share Price, based on its
professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley discounted each analyst's price target to present
value assuming a cost of equity of 9.3%. This analysis resulted in a discounted analyst current price target
range for SPX FLOW common stock of $69.00 to $99.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
Morgan Stanley compared these ranges to the Per Share Price of SPX FLOW common stock in cash, to
the closing trading price of SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior
to The Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand
had made takeover bids for SPX FLOW, and the closing trading price of $85.63 on December 10, 2021.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect
current market trading prices for SPX FLOW common stock and these estimates are subject to
uncertainties, including the future financial performance of SPX FLOW and future financial market
conditions.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which is designed to provide an implied
value of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed
and compared certain financial estimates for SPX FLOW with comparable publicly available consensus
equity analyst research estimates for selected companies that, in Morgan Stanley's professional judgment,
share certain similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratios of aggregate value, which Morgan Stanley
defined as fully diluted market capitalization plus net debt, plus non-controlling interest (as appropriate for
the company being analyzed), less investment in associate (as appropriate for the company being
analyzed), to EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization
for the calendar year 2022, which ratios Morgan Stanley referred to as Aggregate Value/CY2022E EBITDA,
calculated with the burden of stock based compensation. Certain of the foregoing terms are used throughout
this summary of financial analyses.
The below table summarizes the companies, the metrics and the multiples employed in this analysis:

Based on its analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected a reference range of
Aggregate Value/CY2022E EBITDA, burdened by stock-based compensation, of 11.0x-15.0x for SPX FLOW.
Morgan Stanley applied the elected reference range to the adjusted EBITDA set forth in the Street
Consensus Case, the Management Case-Adjusted, and the Management Case-Long Range Plan.
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of
SPX FLOW common stock on a fully diluted basis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00):

No company used in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to SPX FLOW or directly
comparable in business mix, size or other metrics. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing
analysis necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences between SPX
FLOW and the companies being compared and other factors that would affect the value of the companies to
which SPX FLOW is being compared. In selecting comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous
judgments and assumptions with respect to size, business mix, industry performance, general business,
regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of SPX FLOW. These include, among other things, selected company growth and profitability, the
impact of competition on the business of SPX FLOW or the industry generally, industry growth, and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition or prospects of SPX FLOW or the
industry, or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of
using selected company data.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on SPX FLOW, which is designed to provide an
implied value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal
value of such company. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share
equity values for SPX FLOW.
Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated present value of the unlevered free cash flows that SPX FLOW
was forecasted to generate from the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021 through calendar year 2025 on a
standalone basis. Morgan Stanley performed this analysis on the estimated future cash flows contained in
the Street Consensus Forecasted Financial Information, the Public Guidance Forecasted Financial
Information, the Management Case-Adjusted and the Management Case-Long Range Plan.
For purposes of this analysis, unlevered free cash flows were calculated as adjusted EBITDA (burdened by
stock based compensation) less depreciation and amortization, plus minority interest, to arrive at operating
income, less taxes (assuming a 25.0% of cash tax rate for the projection period per SPX FLOW
management guidance to reflect tax assets and incentives and assuming 28.0% of tax rate in the terminal
year to reflect normalized level of tax rate), to arrive at net operating profit after tax, plus depreciation and
amortization, less increases in net working capital, less cash restructuring expenses, less capital
expenditures, adjusted for any net proceeds from asset sales or expenditure on asset purchases. These
estimated unlevered free cash flows were reviewed and approved by SPX FLOW management for Morgan
Stanley's use.
Morgan Stanley calculated terminal values for SPX FLOW by applying a range of terminal growth rates of
2.0% to 3.0%, based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment, to the unlevered free cash flows of SPX
FLOW through 2025. Morgan Stanley then discounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to
present value as of September 30, 2021, using a range of discount rates from 7.7% to 9.5%, which were
selected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment.
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of
SPX FLOW common stock on a fully diluted basis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00):

Morgan Stanley compared this range to the Per Share Price of SPX FLOW common stock in cash, to the
closing trading price of SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to
news reports speculating about Ingersoll Rand's offer for SPX FLOW, and the closing trading price of $85.63
on December 10, 2021.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the
potential future equity value of a company as a function of the company's estimated future earnings. The
resulting equity value
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
was subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value for such company's
potential future equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied
present equity values per share on a standalone basis for SPX FLOW.
To calculate the discounted equity value for SPX FLOW, Morgan Stanley used estimated Aggregate
Value/NTM EBITDA based on (i) the Street Consensus Forecasted Financial Information, (ii) the Public
Guidance Forecasted Financial Information, (iii) the Management Case-Adjusted, and (iv) the Management
Case-Long Range Plan. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience after
reviewing and comparing certain financial estimates for SPX FLOW, Morgan Stanley applied a range of
Aggregate Value/NTM EBITDA multiples of 11.0x to 14.0x to these NTM estimates as of year-end 2022,
which range was selected based upon Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and experience taking into
account SPX FLOW's and its peers' historical long-term trading multiples, and discounted the resulting
equity values to September 30, 2021 at a discount rate of 9.3%, which rate was selected based on the
estimated cost of equity for SPX FLOW.
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the below ranges of implied equity value per share of
Company common stock on a fully diluted basis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00). Morgan
Stanley also derived the below implied equity value per share of Company common stock on a fully diluted
basis utilizing SPX FLOW's average Aggregate Value/NTM EBITDA multiple of 10.1x since the completion of
the Spin-Off on September 26, 2015 until July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to The Wall Street Journal
publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover bids for
SPX FLOW, in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00.

Other Factors
Morgan Stanley observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analyses
with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the
following:
Precedent Transactions Analysis
For informational purposes, Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed
to imply a value of a company based on publicly available financial terms of selected transactions. Morgan
Stanley selected, based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and knowledge of the sector, certain
flow control related sector transactions since 2011 for which relevant financial information was publicly
available.
For these transactions, Morgan Stanley reviewed the purchase price paid and calculated the ratio of the
aggregate value of each transaction to the estimated last twelve months EBITDA (burdened by stock-based
compensation where such information was available), which we refer to as LTM EBITDA, based on publicly
available financial information. Morgan Stanley reviewed the transactions in connection with this analysis
and determined the high, median and low multiples for such selected transactions as 18.9x, 12.0x and 8.3x,
respectively.
The selected precedent transactions varied significantly based upon company scale, business risks, growth
prospects and geography, as well as prevailing market trends. Based on its experience and professional
judgment and taking into consideration, among other things, (i) the observed multiples for the precedent
transactions listed above, (ii) the different business, financial and operating characteristics of the companies
in such transactions as compared to the Company and (iii) the prevailing market trends for the valuation and
performance companies in the Company's industry at the time of each transaction as compared to the
current prevailing market trends, Morgan Stanley applied Aggregate Value/LTM EBITDA multiple range of
11.0x to 15.0x to the Company's estimated EBITDA for 2021 of $226 million based on the Management
Case-Long Range Plan.
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied fully diluted share prices for shares of
SPX FLOW common stock of $56.00 to $77.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
No company or transaction used in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to SPX FLOW or the
Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of SPX FLOW, such as the impact of competition on SPX
FLOW's business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change
in the financial condition or prospects of SPX FLOW or the industry, or in the financial markets in general.
Precedent Premia Analysis
For informational purposes, Morgan Stanley also discussed with the Board, based on publicly available
information, the premiums paid in certain U.S. acquisition transactions. The analyses excluded terminated
transactions, employee stock ownership plan transactions, self-tenders, spin-offs, share repurchases,
minority interest transactions, exchange offers, recapitalizations and restructurings, as they were not
considered comparable to the Merger. Morgan Stanley considered premiums paid in announced
transactions with a transaction value of approximately $1 billion or more that involved U.S. publicly traded
target companies since 2005. The average premium paid in all such transactions since 2005 was 33%.
Based on the foregoing, Morgan Stanley applied a premium range of 20% to 40% to the closing trading price
of SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to The Wall Street
Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover
bids for SPX FLOW. Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied fully diluted
share prices for SPX FLOW common stock of $75.00 to $87.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
No company or transaction used in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to SPX FLOW or the
merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of SPX, such as the impact of competition on SPX FLOW's
business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the
financial condition or prospects of SPX FLOW or the industry, or in the financial markets in general.
General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary
description. Morgan Stanley arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken and
assessed as a whole, and it did not ascribe a specific range of values to SPX FLOW common stock or
draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to, and did not attribute any particular weight to, any one
factor or method of analysis, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of
each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the
context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. In addition, in rendering its opinion, Morgan
Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors
and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the
ranges of implied valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions
and other matters. Many of these assumptions are beyond the control of SPX FLOW. Any estimates
contained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of SPX FLOW common
stock and in connection with the delivery of its written opinion, dated December 12, 2021, to the Board.
These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of SPX FLOW
common stock might actually trade.
The Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of SPX FLOW common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was determined through arm's-length negotiations between SPX FLOW and Buyer, rather
than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The Company's decision to enter into the
Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. As described in the section entitled “Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the Board”
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
beginning on page 34, Morgan Stanley's analyses were only one of the factors considered by the Board in
its evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or
management with respect to the Merger or the Per Share Price.
Morgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with its customary practice. No limitations were imposed by the Board upon
Morgan Stanley with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.
Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific amount or form of consideration to us or that any specific
amount or form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
The Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation,
its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company's industry, and its knowledge and
understanding of SPX FLOW's business and affairs. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm
engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its
securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange,
commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing
and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest
on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their
customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Buyer, Buyer's affiliates, SPX FLOW, or any other
company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative
instrument.
As compensation for Morgan Stanley's services relating to its engagement, the Company has agreed to pay
Morgan Stanley a total fee of approximately $34 million, approximately $9 million of which became payable
upon the rendering of its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent upon the completion of the
Merger. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses including,
without limitation, professional and legal fees and disbursements, plus any sales, use or other taxes related
to such fees and disbursements, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated. In addition, SPX FLOW
has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and
employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain
liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out
of Morgan Stanley's engagement.
In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley's opinion, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates (i) have
provided financial advisory services to SPX FLOW for which Morgan Stanley or its affiliates has received, in
the aggregate, compensation of less than $1 million, and (ii) have provided financing services to Lone Star
and majority controlled affiliates and portfolio companies thereof for which Morgan Stanley or its affiliates
has received, in the aggregate, compensation of between $5 million and $10 million, and Morgan Stanley or
its affiliates are also currently engaged by a majority controlled affiliate of Lone Star to provide financing
services thereto for which Morgan Stanley would expect to receive fees for any such services under certain
circumstances. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing
services to the Company and Lone Star and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to
receive fees for the rendering of any such services.

The Merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Buyer. The Company anticipates that the total
amount of funds needed to pay Company stockholders and holders of other equity-based awards the
amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement, which will be approximately $3.723 billion based upon
the number of shares of SPX FLOW common stock (and other SPX FLOW equity-based interests)
outstanding as of January 31, 2022, and other fees and expenses necessary to complete the Merger and
related transactions, including the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under SPX FLOW’s current credit
facilities, will be funded through a combination of cash held by the Company, the Equity Commitment of up
to $1.878 billion of equity financing and up to $2.31 billion of debt financing on the closing date.

In connection with the equity financing and as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Buyer has entered
into an Equity Commitment Letter, with Lone Star pursuant to which Lone Star has committed, subject to

consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been satisfied (other than any
condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the closing but each of which would be satisfied if the
closing were to occur), as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to
Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 74, at a time when the closing would have otherwise occurred
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (2) the debt financing (as described below) has been funded in
accordance with its terms or will be funded in accordance with its terms at the closing if the equity financing
is funded at the closing and (3) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that all conditions to the
Company's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 74
have been satisfied (or waived) and if specific performance is granted and the equity financing and the debt
financing are funded, then the closing would occur.

In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub has entered into the Debt Commitment
Letter, with the commitment parties, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,
the applicable commitment parties have committed to provide the credit facilities which include (1) a seven-
year senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,540.0 million, (2) a five-

In considering the recommendation of the Company's Board that Company stockholders vote to approve the
Merger Proposal, Company stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of SPX
FLOW have interests in the proposed Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Company stockholders generally. The Company's Board was aware of and considered these interests,
among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in making its
recommendation that Company stockholders vote to approve the Merger Proposal. See the section entitled
“Proposal No. 1 - The Merger-Background to the Merger” and the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 - The
Merger-Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board.” These interests are described in more

As described more fully in “The Merger Agreement-Employee Matters,” pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Buyer has agreed to provide continuing employees, including the executive officers, with the following for one
year after the Effective Time: (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, cash-based bonus
opportunities (including annual and quarterly bonus opportunities and cash long-term incentive opportunities)

The Merger Agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to the outstanding equity
awards at the Effective Time, including those held by our directors and executive officers.
Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Restricted Share will be fully vested, cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to applicable
withholding, equal to the Per Share Price.
Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Option, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding,
equal to (1) the total number of shares of Company common stock issuable upon exercise in full of such
Option, multiplied by (2) the
49TABLE OF CONTENTS
excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of such Option. Each Option with an
exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Per Share Price will be cancelled as of the Effective
Time without payment.
Performance Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each outstanding PSU to the extent unvested will vest in
accordance with the following: (i) if the applicable performance period has not been completed, the PSU will
vest at the target level of performance (or, with respect to the PSUs that vest on the basis of the Company's
operating income margin, at 325% of the target level of performance and with respect to the PSUs that vest
on the basis of the Company's total shareholder return and were issued in 2020 or 2021, at 200% of the
target level of performance) and (ii) if the applicable performance period has been completed, the PSU will
vest at the actual level of performance, as determined in accordance with the terms of each outstanding
award agreement. All vested PSUs will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding, equal to (1) the total number of shares of
Company common stock subject to such vested PSUs, multiplied by (2) the Per Share Price.
Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit, vested or unvested,
will be fully vested, cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and
subject to applicable withholding, equal to (1) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject
to such Restricted Stock Units, multiplied by (2) the Per Share Price.
The number of outstanding equity-based awards that will be held by each executive officer of SPX FLOW as
of March 31, 2022 (assuming continued service through such date) is set forth below, along with the
estimated cash amount (inclusive of accrued dividend equivalent cash payments for Restricted Stock Units
and PSUs that will vest in connection with the Merger, but without subtraction of applicable withholding
taxes) each officer would be eligible to receive in connection with the consummation of the Merger with
regard to such equity awards. For purposes of the table, we have assumed continued service by each
executive through March 31, 2022 and for purposes of the PSUs, the numbers below represent the
percentage of target at which all such PSUs will vest in connection with the Merger, as described above, for
awards with performance periods ending after March 31, 2022.

In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, certain executive officers of the
Company (including its current named executive officers) may become entitled to payments and benefits
that could constitute “excess parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G (“Section 280G”) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To mitigate the potential impact of Section
280G on the Company and the executive officers, on December 20, 2021, the Compensation Committee of
the Company's Board approved the acceleration into December 2021 of the following compensation items
with respect to the Company's named executive officers: (i) the payment of the portion of the 2021 annual
bonuses under the SPX FLOW Annual Enterprise Incentive Plan that would have otherwise been paid in the
first quarter of 2022 to each named executive officer at 100% performance level (i.e., target), with any portion
of such bonuses earned in excess of the target paid in January 2022, and (ii) the immediate vesting of
Restricted Stock Units and PSUs (collectively, the “Stock Units”) at the following levels for the named
executive officers: 77,063 Stock Units for Mr. Michael, 15,622 Stock Units for Mr. Easley, 11,208 Stock
Units for Mr. Jeffers, and 11,208 Stock Units for Mr. Eamigh, all of which were originally scheduled to vest in
the first quarter of 2022 . The amounts paid to each named executive officer with respect to the payment of
the portion of the 2021 annual bonuses in (i) above were equal to $950,000 for Mr. Michael, $318,885 for Mr.
Easley, $304,690 for Mr. Jeffers and $294,080 for Mr. Eamigh.
With respect to executive officers who are not named executive officers, $157,069 and $296,555 in bonuses
were paid under (i) above to Ms. Buscher and Mr. Ryan, respectively, and 1,288 and 6,509 Stock Units were

We have entered into agreements, including an employment agreement for our President and Chief
Executive Officer and a change-in-control agreement and stock plan award agreements with each of our
executive officers, which govern the executive’s compensation and benefits in the event of a qualifying
termination of employment following a change in control of the Company.
Pursuant to each executive officer’s change-in-control agreement, each officer will be entitled to certain
benefits upon (i) the termination of their employment for any reason other than death, disability, retirement or
“Cause” or (ii) the termination of their employment by the executive officers for “Good Reason,” in each case
within a specified number of months (for Mr. Michael, 36 months, and for Ms. Buscher and Messrs. Easley,
Jeffers, Eamigh and Ryan, 24 months) following a change in control (each, a “Qualifying Termination”).
Under each executive officer's change-in-control agreement, “Cause” generally means with respect to such
executive: (i) willful and continued failure to substantially perform executive's duties with the Company, (ii)
willfully engaging in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or
otherwise, or (iii) conviction of (or pleading nolo contendere to) a felony that impairs the executive's ability
substantially to perform executive's duties with the Company.
Under each executive officer's change-in-control agreement, “Good Reason” generally means, without the
executive's express written consent, the occurrence within two years following a change of control of the
Company of any one or more of the following with respect to such executive:
(i)
A material reduction or alteration in executive's duties and responsibilities, or the status of
executive's position from those in effect on the day prior to the change of control;
(ii)
A material reduction by the Company in executive's base salary or in executive's most recent
annual target incentive award opportunity;
(iii) The Company's requiring executive to be based at a location in excess of fifty (50) miles from the
executive's current location;
(iv) The failure by the Company to continue in effect the Company's employee benefit plans, policies,
practices or arrangements in which the executive participates (including at substantially the same
relative amount and level of participation) prior to the change of control, unless an equitable
arrangement (embodied in an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) to provide similar benefits has
been made with respect to such plan(s); and
(v)
The failure of the Company to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to the Company
to assume and agree to perform the agreement.
51TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the event of a Qualifying Termination, the executive officer will be entitled to the following:
•
a lump sum payment equal to the executive officer’s annual salary multiplied by (i) three for Mr.
Michael and (ii) two for Ms. Buscher and Messrs. Easley, Jeffers, Eamigh and Ryan;
•
a lump sum payment equal to:
(a)
for Mr. Michael, three times the greater of actual bonus paid for the prior year or the target
bonus (calculated based on year-end annual salary) for the termination year;
(b)
for Ms. Buscher and Messrs. Easley, Jeffers, Eamigh and Ryan, two times the greatest of (A)
the highest earned bonus amount for three years prior to the termination year, (B) the target
bonus for the termination year or (C) the earned bonus for the termination year;
•
a lump sum payment equal to the greater of (A) target bonus for the termination year or (B) actual
bonus for the termination year, in either case prorated based on length of employment during such
termination year;
•
value of vesting in all unvested Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units at the agreed
upon performance levels set forth in the section entitled “Treatment of Company Equity Awards”;
•
a cash equivalent of all unused, accrued vacation time;
•
outplacement services not to exceed: (i) $50,000 in total for Mr. Michael and (ii) $35,000 in total for
each of Ms. Buscher and Messrs. Easley, Jeffers, Eamigh and Ryan;
•
life insurance coverage, provided by the Company at the Company’s expense, in an amount equal
to two times the executive officer’s annual salary at the time of termination for two years and
thereafter an amount equal to one times the executive officer’s annual salary for the remainder of
his or her life;
•
continued coverage under the medical, dental and vision plans in which the executive was enrolled
as of the termination date for a period of (i) three years for Mr. Michael and (ii) two years for Ms.
Buscher and Messrs. Easley, Jeffers, Eamigh and Ryan;
•
payment of all base salary for the time period ending on the executive officer's date of termination;
reimbursement of reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the executive officer prior to
termination; and all other amounts to which the executive officer is entitled under any
compensation or benefit plan, program, practice or policy of the Company in effect as of the date of
termination; and
•
Mr. Michael is entitled to reimbursement of expenses related to financial planning, annual tax
return preparation and annual physicals incurred through December 31st of the year including the
second anniversary of his date of termination.
As a condition to receipt of the severance amounts discussed below and referenced in the tables found in “-
Quantification of Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger,” the
executive officer is required to execute a general release and waiver of claims in favor of the Company and
will be bound by the terms of a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement, which prohibits the
executive officer from soliciting or diverting any customer, potential customer, employee or potential
employee or competing with any of our businesses in which the executive has been employed for a period of
one year from the date of termination.
The Merger will constitute a “change in control” for purposes of each of these arrangements. These
arrangements do not include a “gross-up” for any golden parachute excise tax imposed on the executive
officer pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. Rather, if amounts payable under such arrangements would be
subject to an excise tax under the provisions of Code Section 4999, the payments will be reduced to an
amount equal to the greatest dollar amount that would not subject the executive officer to the imposition of
the excise tax, unless the executive officer would be placed in a better after-tax position receiving all
payments and paying the excise tax (the “Best Pay Cutback Provision”). None of the executive officers are
eligible for an excise tax gross-up.
For the quantification of the value of the severance benefits described above that would be payable to the
Company's named executive officers in the event of a Qualifying Termination in connection with a change in
control, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Quantification of Potential Payments to Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” below. With respect to executive officers who are not

(a)
For purposes of this disclosure, we have assumed that each named executive officer would receive an unused
accrued vacation payment of 5 weeks' vacation.
(b)
Because portions of these benefits are self-insured, we calculate and maintain liabilities for this program under
appropriate accounting standards. Generally, the assumptions and methods used for financial reporting were also
used in determining the values in this disclosure (discount rates, mortality, etc.).
(c)
These amounts represent the maximum aggregate value of outplacement assistance that may be provided to each
named executive officer under their change-in-control agreements.
(d)
This amount represents the total post-termination expense reimbursements Mr. Michael is eligible to receive under his
employment agreement following a Qualifying Termination. For purposes of this disclosure, we have assumed (i) that
Mr. Michael would use the maximum value of financial planning and annual tax return preparation expense
reimbursements he is eligible to receive (or $30,000 per year) and (ii) Mr. Michael would likely spend a similar amount
as he has in past years on his annual physicals, estimated to be $1,500 per year based on expense reimbursements
received for the same benefit in 2017 and 2018 of $1,275 and $1,336, respectively. It is estimated that such expense
reimbursements would be incurred by Mr. Michael through December 31st of the year of the second anniversary of
the Effective Time.

The following summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that are
generally applicable to stockholders of SPX FLOW. The following discussion is based upon the Code, the
Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, and existing administrative rulings and court decisions,
each as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These authorities are subject to change, possibly
with retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. Any change could affect the validity of the following
discussion. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not challenge one
or more of the tax considerations described herein. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any
ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following
summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a
court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
This discussion is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
may be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances nor does it address any aspects of
U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes, the alternative minimum tax or any aspects of the tax on “net
investment income” imposed under
54TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 1411 of the Code. This discussion also does not address any special tax rules applicable to
particular stockholders such as stockholders that are financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, S
corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entities or arrangements), insurance companies, dealers
in securities or traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, stockholders who acquired their shares of SPX FLOW
common stock pursuant to the exercise of compensatory stock options or otherwise in connection with the
performance of services, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S.
dollar, U.S. expatriates, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, any person who
receives consideration other than cash in the Merger (or any transaction related thereto), retirement plans or
other tax-deferred accounts, and stockholders who hold their shares of SPX FLOW common stock as part
of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction, constructive sale or conversion transaction. The following
discussion does not address tax consequences to the persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse
tax. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of SPX FLOW common stock as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not
address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders who demand appraisal rights under Delaware
law. In addition, the following discussion does not address non-income tax consequences or the tax
consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the Merger (whether
or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the Merger).
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of SPX FLOW common
stock that is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or an entity
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise treated as such for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the
United States and all of the substantial decisions of which one or more “United States persons” (as defined
in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control, or (b) that has a valid election in effect
under the applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a “United States person” under the Code.
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of SPX FLOW
common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes is the owner of shares of SPX FLOW common stock, the tax treatment of the partner or owner in
such partnership or other entity or arrangement will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the
activities of the partnership or other entity or arrangement. Accordingly, partnerships and other pass-through
entities that hold shares of SPX FLOW common stock and partners or owners of such partnerships or other
entities, as applicable, should consult their own respective tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of
the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH BELOW ARE INCLUDED FOR
GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW AS OF THE
DATE HEREOF. EACH HOLDER OF SHARES OF SPX FLOW COMMON STOCK IS URGED TO
CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
TO SUCH HOLDER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND
NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
In General
The Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the
surrendered shares of SPX FLOW common stock. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of SPX
FLOW common stock is generally the amount paid for such shares of SPX FLOW common stock (less the
amount of any distribution received by such holder treated as a tax-free return of capital). If a U.S. Holder
acquired different blocks of shares of SPX FLOW common stock at different times or at different prices,
such U.S. Holder must determine gain or loss separately for each block of shares of SPX FLOW common
stock exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss,
and any such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period
for the shares of SPX FLOW common stock is greater than one year as of the closing. A
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reduced rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Cash consideration received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger may be subject to backup withholding
and information reporting. Backup withholding generally will apply only if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish a
correct taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) or otherwise fails to comply with applicable backup withholding
rules and certification requirements. Corporations are generally exempt from backup withholding. Each U.S.
Holder should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9 (or substitute or successor form) included with the letter
of transmittal and certify under penalties of perjury that such number is correct and that such U.S. Holder is
not subject to backup withholding. If a U.S. Holder fails to provide the correct TIN or certification, payments
received may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a 24% rate. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Amounts so withheld can be credited against such U.S. Holder's federal income tax liability
and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS.
Non-U.S. Holders
In General
Subject to the discussion below in “-Backup Withholding and Information Reporting”, a Non-U.S. Holder will
generally not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized upon such Non-U.S.
Holder's exchange of shares of SPX FLOW common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement unless (i)
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 or more days during the
taxable year of such disposition and certain other conditions are met, (ii) the gain is effectively connected
with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder (and, if an applicable income tax treaty
so provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States), or (iii) such Non-U.S. Holder's shares of SPX FLOW common stock constitute
a “U.S. real property interest” under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, as amended,
which will, in general, be the case if, at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the
Merger or the Non-U.S. Holder's holding period for its shares of SPX FLOW common stock, SPX FLOW was
a “United States real property holding corporation” and such holder held (actually or constructively) more
than 5% of the shares of SPX FLOW common stock.
If a holder is a Non-U.S. Holder who is an individual and has been present in the United States for 183 or
more days during the taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are satisfied, such holder will
be subject to a 30% tax (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty) on the gain recognized in the Merger
(which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses).
If a holder is a Non-U.S. Holder and any gain recognized in the Merger is effectively connected with a U.S.
trade or business (and, in the case of certain tax treaties, is attributable to a permanent establishment or
fixed base within the United States), then the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be taxed in the same manner
as a U.S. Holder. If the Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to an additional
“branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty
between the U.S. and such Non-U.S. Holder's country of residence.
SPX FLOW believes that it is not, and will not be as of the effective date of the Merger, a “U.S. real property
holding corporation.” However, there is no assurance that the IRS will not challenge that determination. In
the event that the IRS were to successfully assert that SPX FLOW is a U.S. real property holding
corporation, then any gain recognized on the sale of SPX FLOW's stock by a Non-U.S. Holder who or that
held (actually or constructively pursuant to applicable stock ownership attribution rules) more than 5% of
SPX FLOW's common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or
such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for its shares of SPX FLOW common stock would be treated as
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and would therefore be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at the graduated rates applicable to an individual or a corporation
(depending on the Non-U.S. Holder's status). Each Non-U.S. Holders should consult its individual tax
advisors with respect to these rules and the application of these rules to such Non-U.S. Holder’s particular
circumstances.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
A Non-U.S. Holder is generally not subject to backup withholding and information reporting as described
above under “-U.S. Holders-Backup Withholding and Information Reporting,” provided such Non-U.S. Holder
properly certifies
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
its non-U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8 BEN-E, or another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8
or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts so
withheld can be credited against such Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may
entitle such Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS.
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION
OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION,
THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT ON, A STOCKHOLDER'S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO CERTAIN TYPES OF
STOCKHOLDERS MENTIONED ABOVE. MOREOVER, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY
NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY NON-U.S., STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.

HSR Clearance. Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions, including
the Merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the
Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Completion
of the Merger is subject to the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act. The Merger may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period, which
begins when Buyer and SPX FLOW file Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with
the Antitrust Division and the FTC, unless such waiting period is earlier terminated by the Antitrust Division
and the FTC. Buyer and SPX FLOW filed their Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms on December 17,
2021, in connection with the Merger, and the waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on January
18, 2022.
Non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as
they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also
seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither Buyer nor
SPX FLOW believes that the Merger will violate the antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a
challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would
not be successful.
Additional Regulatory Clearance. The Merger is also subject to the filing or obtaining certain necessary
notices, clearances, approvals, waivers or consents by the antitrust and other regulatory authorities in other
jurisdictions, including the Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between
undertakings (European Union), the Anti-Monopoly Law of China 2007 and SAMR Interim Provisions on the
Review of Concentration of Undertakings of 2020 (The People's Republic of China), Turkish Law on
Protection of Competition No. 4054, as amended, and Communiqué No. 2010/4 on Mergers and
Acquisitions Requiring the Approval of Competition Board (Turkey), and Articles L. 151-1 et seq. and R. 151-
1 et seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code as per last amendment on 31 December 2019 (Décret
no 2019-1590) (France). The Merger cannot be completed until SPX FLOW and Buyer obtain clearance to
consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated in such
jurisdictions.
The Merger received approval from the applicable governmental entity in Turkey with respect to the above
referenced antitrust laws in Turkey on January 7, 2022.",67,67

Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned O’Dell v. SPX FLOW, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-00309
(S.D.N.Y.) (the “O’Dell Litigation”). The complaint names the Company and the Company’s directors as
defendants. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in
connection with the disclosures contained in the January 11, 2022 preliminary proxy statement issued by
the Company.
On January 21, 2022, a purported stockholder of SPX FLOW filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Ciccotelli v. SPX FLOW, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-
00582 (S.D.N.Y.) (the
57TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Ciccotelli Litigation” and, together with the O’Dell Litigation, the “Stockholder Litigation”). The complaint
names the Company and the Company’s directors as defendants. The complaint asserts claims under
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the disclosures contained in the January
11, 2022 preliminary proxy statement issued by the Company.
The complaints seek a variety of equitable and injunctive relief including, among other things, enjoining the
consummation of the Merger, rescinding the transaction if it is consummated, and awarding the plaintiffs
costs and attorneys’ fees.
On January 20, 2022, SPX FLOW received a demand letter on behalf of a purported SPX FLOW stockholder,
Shiva Stein (the “Stein Demand”). The Stein Demand alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed on
January 11, 2022 by SPX FLOW in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement omits material information with respect to such transactions, and requests that SPX FLOW
disseminate corrective disclosures in an amendment or supplement to this proxy statement.
On January 26, 2022, SPX FLOW received a demand letter from another putative SPX FLOW stockholder
demanding access to certain books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law allegedly for the purpose of (i) investigating the events leading to the Merger Agreement; (ii)
investigating the independence and disinterestedness of the Board and SPX FLOW’s management in
connection with the Merger; (iii) investigating the completeness of SPX FLOW’s disclosures regarding the
Merger Agreement and Merger; (iv) determining whether wrongdoing, mismanagement, and/or material non-
disclosure has taken place such that it would be appropriate to file an action against SPX FLOW, the Board,
and/or any of SPX FLOW’s officers; (v) ascertaining the value of stockholders’ shares; and/or (vi) considering
any other courses of action (the “220 Demand” and together with the Stein Demand, the “Demand Letters”).
The Company believes the claims in the Stockholder Litigation and the Demand Letters are without merit.
However, at this time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters or their effects on the
Company or the Merger. An adverse judgment for monetary damages could have an adverse effect on the
Company. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the completion of the Merger, and an adverse
judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin completion of the Merger.
SPX FLOW stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the transaction, which may name SPX
FLOW, members of SPX FLOW’s Board, or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the
outcome of such lawsuits or the lawsuits described above.",67,68

Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Buyer, the closing of the Merger will
take place at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time), on the third business day following the day on which the last of the
conditions to be satisfied or waived in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) is satisfied or waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement. However, if the marketing period
(as defined in the Merger Agreement) for Buyer's debt financing has not ended as of the day on which the
last of such conditions is fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), then the closing will not
occur until the business day that is no earlier than three business days following

the earlier of (a) the day during the marketing period on which Buyer provides written notice to the Company
that the marketing period will be deemed ended (provided, that such notice may be conditioned upon the
simultaneous completion of the debt financing, and provided further, that if such debt financing is not
completed for any reason at any time, such notice will automatically be deemed withdrawn) and (b) the day
the marketing period otherwise ends, or in any case, at such other time, place and day as the Company
and Buyer agreed in writing. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “business day” refers to any day ending
at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time), other than a Saturday or Sunday, or a day on which banks are required or
authorized to close in the City of New York.
On the closing date, SPX FLOW, Merger Sub and Buyer will file the certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger will become effective at the time when the certificate of Merger
has been duly filed with and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later
time as may be agreed by the Company and Buyer in writing and specified in the certificate of Merger.
As of the date of the filing of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger during the first half of
calendar year 2022. However, completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the completion of the Merger, which are described below and include regulatory clearances,
and it is possible that the Merger will not be completed until a later time, or at all. There may be a
substantial amount of time between the Special Meeting and the completion of the Merger. After the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, SPX FLOW's Board will not have the right to terminate the Merger
Agreement in order to accept any Alternative Acquisition Proposal.

response to a request by a person making the written Acquisition Proposal if the Company
received from the person making the Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable in the aggregate to, the Company
than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (including any standstill agreement contained
therein) provided that, (a) the Company shall provide Buyer with a non-redacted copy of each
confidentiality agreement the Company has executed in accordance with the Merger Agreement
within 24 hours of its execution and (b) any non-public information provided to any such person will
have been previously provided to Buyer or will be provided to Buyer prior to or promptly following the
time it is provided to such person (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter); and

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal,
that involves more than 50% of the consolidated total assets (including equity securities of SPX FLOW's
subsidiaries), consolidated revenues or consolidated net income or the total voting power of any class of
equity securities of the Company, that SPX FLOW's Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, (1) taking into account all relevant factors (including
closing certainty, certainty of financing, the legal, financial, timing, regulatory and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal, conditions to consummation and the identity of the person(s) making the proposal)
and the likelihood of the proposal being completed in accordance with its terms that, if completed, would
result in a transaction more favorable to SPX FLOW's stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger and (2) that is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed.
SPX FLOW must notify Buyer within 24 hours if SPX FLOW, any of its subsidiaries or its or their
representatives receives (1) any inquiries, indications of interest, proposals or offers with respect to, or that
are reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (2) any request by any person for non-public
information in connection with or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (3) any request to initiate or
continue discussions or negotiations, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, setting forth in the notice the
identity of the person making or delivering such inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer, and the
material terms and conditions of such inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer and any draft
agreement or other relevant transaction documents provided in connection therewith and thereafter must
keep Buyer reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such inquiry, indication
of interest, proposal or offer (including by notifying Buyer in writing of any amendments or material

changes thereto within 24 hours of receipt thereof by the Company) and the status of any such discussions

SPX FLOW's Board has unanimously recommended that SPX FLOW stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger
Proposal. The Merger Agreement permits SPX FLOW's Board to effect a Change of Recommendation (as
defined below) only in certain limited circumstances, as described below.
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, SPX FLOW's Board may not:
•
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify) in a manner adverse to Buyer, the Company Recommendation with
respect to the Merger or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal made after the date of the Merger Agreement;
•
cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other contract, except for an
acceptable confidentiality agreement as defined in the Merger Agreement, in each case
constituting or related to or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to result in any Acquisition
Proposal, an “alternative acquisition agreement”;
•
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement;
•
fail to include the Company Recommendation in this proxy statement; or
•
fail to expressly reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation within 10 business days following
Buyer's or Merger Sub's written request to do so if an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced
or disclosed (or, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or material amendments, revisions or
changes to the terms of any such previously publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal that are
publicly disclosed within the last 10 business days prior to the then-scheduled stockholders
meeting, fail to take the actions referred to in this paragraph, with reference to the 10 business day
period being replaced with three business days).
The actions described in the first bullet point above is referred to in this proxy statement as a “Change of
Recommendation.”
However, before the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, SPX FLOW's Board may effect a Change of
Recommendation and/or terminate the Merger Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, if SPX
FLOW's Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, taking into account all adjustments to
the terms of the Merger Agreement offered by Buyer. Before effecting a Change of Recommendation or
terminating the Merger Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, (1) SPX FLOW must have given
Buyer at least five business days' prior written notice of its intention to do so (which notice shall state the
reasons therefor, including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making such
Superior Proposal, and include a copy of the alternative acquisition agreement and any other relevant
transaction documents and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto), (2) SPX FLOW has
negotiated in good faith (to the extent Buyer requests to negotiate) with Buyer during such notice period to
enable Buyer to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that the Board would no longer determine
that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable law and (3) at the end of the notice period, SPX FLOW's Board must determine in
good faith, taking into account any revisions to the terms of Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Buyer
and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the Superior Proposal would
nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Buyer were to be given
effect and that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law (provided further that each material amendment to the
financial terms of the Superior Proposal will be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal, requiring additional
notice to Buyer, and SPX FLOW’s Board may not make a Change of Recommendation without offering to
Buyer to negotiate for three business days from the date of such additional notice).
68TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, before the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, SPX FLOW's Board may effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an “Intervening Event” (as defined below) unrelated to a Superior Proposal if
SPX FLOW's Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, taking into
account any revisions to the Merger Agreement. Before effecting a Change of Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event, (1) SPX FLOW must have given Buyer at least five business days’ prior written
notice of its intention to do so and a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event that serves as
a basis of the Change of Recommendation as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of it, (2)
SPX FLOW has negotiated in good faith (to the extent Buyer requests to negotiate) with Buyer during such
notice period to enable Buyer to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would
obviate the basis for the Change of Recommendation and (3) at the end of the notice period, SPX FLOW's
Board must determine in good faith, taking into account any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement
proposed in writing by Buyer and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that
the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law if the changes proposed by Buyer were to be given effect (provided further that each material
change to facts and circumstances relating to the Intervening Event shall require a new notice and SPX
FLOW’s Board may not make a Change of Recommendation without offering to Buyer to negotiate for three
business days from the date of such additional notice).
Under the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means a material development or material change in
circumstances with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries, occurring after the date of the Merger
Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote that (i) was not known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by the Company's Board as of or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement (or if known or
reasonably foreseeable, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Company's Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement) and (ii) does not relate to (A)
any Acquisition Proposal, (B) the fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating
metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the Merger Agreement (provided that the exception in
this clause (B) shall not prevent or otherwise affect any such development or change underlying the
Company meeting or exceeding such metrics from being taken into account in determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred), or (C) any changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in the market
price or trading volume of the Company common stock (provided that the exception in this clause (C) shall
not prevent or otherwise affect any such development or change underlying such change in market price or
trading value from being taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event occurred); provided,
further, that an Acquisition Proposal that resulted from a breach of SPX FLOW's non-solicitation obligations
under the Merger Agreement may not be the basis for an Intervening Event.
The Merger Agreement does not prohibit SPX FLOW or SPX FLOW's Board from (a) complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of SPX FLOW a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of SPX
FLOW) or (b) making any “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company);
provided that the foregoing will not be deemed to permit SPX FLOW’s Board to make a Change of
Recommendation except in accordance with the Merger Agreement.",78,79

Subject to termination of the Merger Agreement, SPX FLOW has agreed to (i) take all reasonable action
necessary and in accordance with the applicable laws, the rules and regulations of the NYSE and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, to duly call, give notice of and to convene a meeting of the
stockholders of SPX FLOW common stock (which meeting, together with any adjournment or
postponement, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “SPX FLOW stockholders' meeting”) as promptly
as reasonably practicable, in any event no later than 40 calendar days after (a) the 10th calendar day after
the preliminary proxy statement has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not informed the
Company that it intends to review the proxy statement, or (b) if the SEC has, by the 10th calendar day after
the preliminary proxy statement thereof has been filed with the SEC, informed the Company that it intends
to review the proxy statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on this
proxy statement and (ii) unless there was a Change of Recommendation as a result of an Intervening Event,
use reasonable best efforts to solicit from the holders of shares proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger
Agreement. SPX FLOW is permitted to postpone or adjourn the SPX FLOW stockholders' meeting to a later
date for the following reasons:
69TABLE OF CONTENTS
(1) with the consent of Buyer, (2) (A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) due to the Company not having
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares for the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not
a quorum is present, in each case of (A) and (B), to solicit additional proxies, or (C) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company
board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and for such supplemental
or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the
stockholders' meeting; provided, that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the stockholders' meeting
more than twice in the case of clauses (2)(A) and (2)(B). In addition, the Record Date of the Company
stockholders' meeting will not be changed without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Subject to SPX FLOW's rights to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event or a Superior Proposal and to terminate the Merger
Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, as described in the section entitled “-Change of Board
Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement,” SPX FLOW's Board must include the Company
Recommendation in this proxy statement and publicly reaffirm such recommendation within 24 hours after a
request to do so by Buyer or Merger Sub and must take all lawful action to obtain the Requisite Company
Vote.

The consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon Buyer’s receipt of financing. However, under the
Merger Agreement, Buyer is obligated to, and is obligated to cause its affiliates to use their, respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the equity financing and the debt financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter so that the funds
contemplated thereby are available as promptly as practicable but in any event no later than the closing date
(subject to the marketing period). If all or any portion of the debt financing or the Debt Commitment Letter
expire or are terminated prior to the closing, for any reason, or all or any portion of the debt financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer is
obligated to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange for and obtain any such portion in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger
consideration from alternative sources on terms or conditions that are not materially less favorable, taken as
a whole, (as determined by Buyer in its reasonable judgment) than those contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter. Prior to the closing, without the prior written consent of the Company, Buyer will not
agree to, or permit, any amendment, modification or supplement of, or waiver under, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or other documentation relating to the debt financing or the equity
financing or any proposed definitive agreements relating to Buyer’s debt financing to the extent such
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver or proposed definitive agreement would (i) change the
amounts to be funded at the closing under the equity financing and the debt financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof) to an amount below the amount of funds
needed to complete the Merger, (ii) amend, modify or supplement the conditions or contingencies to the
debt financing or the equity financing in a manner adverse to Buyer that would make such conditions less
likely to be satisfied on the closing date or impose new or additional conditions or expand any existing
condition to the receipt of the debt financing or the equity financing, (iii) otherwise delay funding of Buyer’s
financing in any “non de minimis” respect or make funding of Buyer’s financing less likely to occur (including
by making the satisfaction of the conditions to Buyer’s financing less likely to occur) at or prior to the
closing, (iv) impose additional material obligations on the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as
it relates to the satisfaction of the conditions to the availability of the debt financing, (v) change the date for
termination and/or expiration of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter to an earlier
date unless an analogous change is made under the Merger Agreement or (vi) adversely impact the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment
Letter; provided that (A) Buyer may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to (1) add lenders, lead arrangers,

Surviving Corporation to use reasonable best efforts to (1) recognize all service of such employees with the

vesting, accruals, and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant, other than benefit accruals
under a defined benefit pension plan, (2) waive any eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements, and (3) provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles incurred prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any such

Each of the parties has agreed that if for any reason any of the provisions of the Merger Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee or Equity Commitment Letter are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm would be caused for which money damages would
not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, except where the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, in
addition to any other available remedies a party may have in equity or at law, each party will be entitled to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining
any breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of the Merger Agreement. Each of
the parties has acknowledged and agreed that, subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement,
such relief for specific performance shall include the right of the Company to cause Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated thereby, in each case, if each of the mutual closing conditions and the
closing conditions of Buyer set forth in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than
conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions at the closing) and the closing is required to occur. The parties have further agreed that
(i) by seeking specific performance, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief, at law or in equity, that may be available to a party under the Merger Agreement, including monetary
damages in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated or in the event that specific performance is
not

available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) no party shall be required to institute any action or proceeding
for (or limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance before exercising any
termination right under the Merger Agreement (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any action or proceeding pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement restrict or limit
any party's right to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms or pursue any other
remedies under the Merger Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, in the event that any action or proceeding is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the
Merger Agreement, no party will allege or assert, and each party has waived the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy at law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of the Company to seek specific performance of Buyer’s and Merger
Sub's obligations to cause the equity financing to be funded and to complete the Merger will only be
available if (1) all conditions to Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement have been satisfied (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until
the closing but each of which would be satisfied if the closing were to occur) at a time when the closing
would have otherwise occurred pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (2) the debt financing has been funded in
accordance with its terms or will be funded in accordance with its terms at the closing if the equity financing
is funded at the closing and (3) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that all conditions to the
Company's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been
satisfied (or waived) and if specific performance is granted and the equity financing and the debt financing
are funded, then the closing would occur.

COMPENSATION","Proposal No. 2 - Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, SPX
FLOW is providing its stockholders with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the
merger, as described in the section entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments to Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger” under “Proposal No. 1 - The Merger-Interests of SPX FLOW's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” including the footnotes to the table and related narrative
discussion beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement.
SPX FLOW's Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of SPX FLOW approve the following
resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to SPX FLOW's named executive
officers in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 - The Merger-Interests of SPX FLOW's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments to Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger,” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative
discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger
Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve Advisory
Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the Advisory Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it
will not be binding on either SPX FLOW or Buyer. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is approved and the
Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto
under the applicable compensation agreements and arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-
binding, advisory vote of SPX FLOW's stockholders.
The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of SPX FLOW's named executive officers
on an advisory basis requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present and represented by proxy
and entitled to vote with respect to this proposal.
SPX FLOW's Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of SPX FLOW vote “FOR” the
Advisory Compensation Proposal.

The Company's stockholders are being asked to approve the Adjournment Proposal, a proposal for one or
more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the Merger Proposal if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the
Merger Proposal. If this Adjournment Proposal is approved, the Special Meeting could be adjourned by SPX
FLOW's Board to any date. In addition, SPX FLOW's Board could postpone the Special Meeting before it
commences. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, SPX FLOW may postpone or adjourn the stockholders
meeting (i) with the written consent of Buyer; (ii)(A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) due to the
Company not having received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Requisite Company
Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, in each case, to solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Company's stockholders prior to the stockholders meeting; provided, that the Company may not
postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting more than twice pursuant to clauses (ii)(A) and/or (ii)(B).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, at the request of Buyer, to the extent permitted by Law,
adjourn the stockholders meeting to a date specified by Buyer due to the absence of a quorum or if the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares for the Requisite Company
Vote; provided that the Company shall not be required to adjourn the stockholders meeting more than once
at the request of Buyer, and no such adjournment pursuant to this sentence shall be required to be for a
period exceeding 10 business days.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have
already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before their use. If you sign and
return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you sign and return a proxy
and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the
Adjournment Proposal, your shares of common stock will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal.
The Company does not anticipate calling a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if Proposal 1, the Merger
Proposal is approved by the requisite number of shares of SPX FLOW common stock at the Special
Meeting.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the Merger Proposal. Accordingly,
you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the Adjournment Proposal and vice
versa.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of shares present
or represented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to this proposal.
SPX FLOW's Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of SPX FLOW vote “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal, if a vote on the Adjournment Proposal is called.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF SPX FLOW STOCKHOLDERS",91,93
"SPX FLOW, Inc._20220201_DEFM14A_19813071_4373457.Pdf",APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF SPX FLOW STOCKHOLDERS,"If the Merger is consummated, a holder of the common stock who does not vote in favor of the Merger
Proposal and who properly demands appraisal of its shares of common stock, who does not effectively
withdraw its demand or waive or lose the right to appraisal and who otherwise complies with the
requirements for perfecting and preserving appraisal rights, will be entitled to seek appraisal of his, her or its
shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the
DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex C. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a
recommendation that a holder of the common stock exercise its appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a
holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered
in that holder's name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the
name of another person, such as a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the
record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal
rights. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee and
you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker, trust or the other
nominee.
Under Section 262, a holder of shares of common stock who (1) does not vote in favor of the Merger
Proposal; (2) continuously is the record holder of such shares from the date of the making of the demand
through the effective date of the Merger; and (3) otherwise follows the procedures set forth in Section 262
may be entitled to have its shares of common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, on
the amount determined to be fair value, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The “fair value” of
the shares of common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more than, the
same as or less than the Per Share Price the stockholders are otherwise entitled to receive under the
Merger Agreement.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its
stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of
Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes notice to holders of the common stock that appraisal rights
are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so, should review Annex C
carefully and consult with legal advisors. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a
timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A holder of common
stock who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price described in
the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to
seek appraisal of shares of common stock, the Company encourages a stockholder considering exercising
such rights to seek the advice of legal counsel.
A stockholder wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of its shares of common stock must do ALL
of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal;
•
the stockholder must deliver to SPX FLOW a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the
Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting and be a stockholder of record at the time of the making of
such demand;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of common stock from the date of making the
demand through the effective date of the Merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the
stockholder transfers the shares before the effective date of the Merger); and
•
a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly
demanded appraisal or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of common stock within 120
days after the effective date of the Merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any
such petition and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the stockholder's obligation to
initiate all necessary action to perfect his, her or its appraisal rights in respect of his, her or its
shares of common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262.
83TABLE OF CONTENTS
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
Merger Proposal, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote
against or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal or not vote their shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to SPX FLOW,
before the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting at which the Merger Proposal will be
submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder's shares of common
stock. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the
date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the
effective date of the Merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless
revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, and it will result in the stockholder's loss of appraisal
rights and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who
submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to
vote against or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. Neither voting against the Merger Proposal nor
abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written
demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be
in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal. A stockholder's failure to make
the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will result in
a loss of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder's name on the date the written demand is made. A demand for appraisal in respect
of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably
inform SPX FLOW of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand
appraisal of the holder's shares of common stock in connection with the Merger. If the shares of common
stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand
must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than
one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of
all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may
execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record
owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the
record owner or owners.
A STOCKHOLDER WHO HOLDS ITS SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS, TRUST OR
OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT
WITH ITS BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A
DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN
SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER,
TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW
PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of common stock
as a nominee for others may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to shares of common
stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In
that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of common stock as to which appraisal is
sought. Where no number of shares of common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be
presumed to cover all shares of common stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds
shares of common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities
depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares much be made by or on
behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record owner.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to: 
SPX FLOW, Inc.
13320 Ballantyne Corporate Place
Charlotte, North Carolina 28277 
Attention: Peter Ryan
At any time within 60 days of the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who
has demanded appraisal but has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a
named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to SPX FLOW a written withdrawal of the demand for
appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective
date of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. If the
Surviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is
required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the
stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value of his, her or its shares of common stock
determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value may be more than, the same as or less than the
Per Share Price.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective date of the Merger, the surviving corporation will
notify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to
Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, that the Merger has become effective
and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation, a
beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal or any record holder
of shares of common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares of common stock held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal.
The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders
should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect
to the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holder of shares of common stock who
desires to have its shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect its appraisal rights in
respect of its shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The
failure of a holder of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could
nullify the holder's previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has
complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon request given in writing,
to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted
in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which SPX FLOW has
received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving
Corporation must give this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the
request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by
a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or
request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for
appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served
upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such
service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as
to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders who have demanded
appraisal and the Surviving Corporation, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on
85
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who
demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the
direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.
In addition, because the common stock is publicly listed on the NYSE (and we do not expect this to change
prior to the Merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of
shares of common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of such
shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock or (y) the value
of the merger consideration in respect of the such total number of shares for which appraisal rights have
been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
appraise the shares of common stock in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the proceeding, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the common stock as of the effective date of the Merger
after taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. When the fair value has been determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery
will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the pendency of the proceeding, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, by the Surviving Corporation to the stockholders entitled to
receive the same, upon surrender by those stockholders of the certificates representing their shares of
common stock or, in the case of holders of uncertificated shares of common stock, forthwith. Unless the
court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the
Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5%
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the
period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before
the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided in the
preceding sentence only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods
which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving
the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,
the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on
future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does
not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value
arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also
stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible
of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
A stockholder considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of its shares of common
stock as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than
the consideration it would receive pursuant to the Merger if it did not seek appraisal of its shares and that an
opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262. Although SPX FLOW believes that the Per Share Price is fair, no representation is made
as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or
lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Price. Neither SPX FLOW nor Buyer anticipate offering more than
the Per Share Price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of SPX FLOW and Buyer
reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of
86
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a share of common stock is less than the Per Share Price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then
the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys'
fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed
upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Each
stockholder seeking appraisal is responsible for his, her or its attorneys' fees and expert witness expenses,
although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails
to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of
common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective date of the Merger into the right to
receive the Per Share Price. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder's right
to appraisal if, among other things, no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of
the Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder's
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Price in accordance with Section 262 within 60
days of the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of SPX FLOW.
From and after the effective date of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be
entitled to vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder's shares of common stock, if
any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the effective date of the Merger. If no petition for an
appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the
Merger or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder
to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery,
however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced the
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court. Failure to comply
strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory
appraisal rights. In view of the complexity of Section 262, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal
rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights. To the extent there
are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.

Opinion of Morgan Stanley
December 12, 2021
Board of Directors
SPX FLOW, Inc.
13320 Ballantyne Corporate Place
Charlotte, NC 28277
Members of the Board:
We understand that SPX FLOW, Inc. (“SPX FLOW” or the “Company”), LSF11 Redwood Acquisitions, LLC
(the “Buyer”), and Redwood Star Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (“Acquisition
Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated
December 11, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the
“Merger”) of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares held in treasury, held by the
Buyer or Acquisition Sub, or as to which dissenters’ rights have been demanded and perfected, will be
converted into the right to receive $86.50 per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions
of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
1)
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial
information of the Company;
2)
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
the Company;
3)
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
4)
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the
Company with senior executives of the Company;
5)
Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
6)
Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the
Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the
Company, and their securities;
7)
Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
8)
Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and
the Buyer and their financial and legal advisors;
9)
Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft commitment letter from certain lenders substantially in
the form of the draft dated December 11, 2021, and certain related documents; and
10) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors
as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and
formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections, we have assumed that
they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In
addition, we have assumed that the Merger will
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,
amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Buyer will obtain
financing required to consummate the Merger and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any
material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with
the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the
proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material
adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not
legal, tax, or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, and regulatory advisors with respect to legal,
tax, and regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of
the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,
relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the
transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the
Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. This opinion does not address
the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to other
business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying
business decision of the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement or proceed with any other transaction
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events
occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do
not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Merger
and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which is contingent upon rendering of this financial
opinion, and the remainder of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to
the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory services for the Company and financing services to the
Buyer and its affiliates, and have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also
seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer and the Company and their respective
affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services. In addition,
Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with the Company in
connection with this transaction, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private
equity funds managed by the Buyer and its affiliates.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment
management and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in
securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives
trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services.
Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage
funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and
effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or
loans of the Buyer and its affiliates, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity,
that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of
Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written
consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is
required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such
inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or
recommendation as to how the shareholders of the Company should vote at the shareholders’ meeting to be
held in connection with the Merger.

part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company:
(a) Merger Consideration. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (a “Share” or, collectively, the “Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive $86.50 per Share in cash (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), without any interest thereon.
At the Effective Time, each Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall automatically cease to exist and
the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time not
represented by certificates (“Book-Entry Shares”) and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, represent Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (the “Certificates”) shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2(b), the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such Share held by them. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with Section 2.2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the Shares exchanged theretofore and represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.
(b) Cancellation of Excluded Shares. All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock
and any Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an
“Excluded Share” and
A-2TABLE OF CONTENTS
collectively, “Excluded Shares”) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist.
(c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
(d) Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by
the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such holder’s
right to appraisal of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”)
will not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but such holder will
be entitled to such rights as afforded under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless
and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares or a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to retain any of the Per Share Merger
Consideration not paid on account of the Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the claims of such
holders, and the remaining holders of Shares shall not be entitled to any portion thereof. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal right with
respect to such Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Shares, and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly provide cash to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares at the Effective
Time in an amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of such
Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be deemed Dissenting Shares under
this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of receiving any written demands
for appraisal of Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by Law, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, offer to settle or settle any such written demands.",106,107

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with BNY Mellon, as paying agent hereunder (and pursuant to an agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) at the Effective
Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments
under Section 2.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that such investments shall be
limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the United States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
Section 2.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent upon demand. No investment losses resulting from
investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the holders of Shares at the
Effective Time to receive the payments as provided herein. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to any such investments or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required to make prompt cash payment under Section 2.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace, restore or increase the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments under
Section 2.1(a).
(b) Exchange Procedures.
(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three business days), the Surviving

Vote”), to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger (subject to

Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their approval at a stockholders’ meeting duly
called and held for such purpose and (C) received the opinion of its financial advisor to the effect
that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, matters, qualifications and

understood that such opinions are for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied on
by Parent or Merger Sub.

with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be
obtained by the Company from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
(x) individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Change or (y) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
(ii) Assuming receipt of the Company Approvals and the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote,
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the
consummation of

or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the

license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, agreement, arrangement or other instrument or
obligation (each, a “Contract”) binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C)

contemplated by this Agreement.

or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they

respects, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all

likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(ii) Assuming receipt of the Parent Approvals, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or default under, the charter or by-laws or comparable governing documents

this clause (2) shall constitute an amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter (such
documentation, the “Commitment Replacement Facility Commitment”)). Each of the Financing
Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties
thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms. Other than the Financing Commitments and the
Fee Letter (as defined below), there are no agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the
Financing Commitments that would be reasonably likely to affect the conditionality of the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing, and the Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent at
the Closing on the terms therein. Except for the fee letter referred to in the Debt Commitment
Letter (the “Fee Letter”) (true, accurate and complete copies of which Parent has delivered to the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement (subject to customary redaction for fees, “flex”
provisions and other economic terms so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely
affect the aggregate principal amount committed under the Debt Commitment Letter, conditionality,
availability or termination of the Debt Financing)), there are no other agreements, side letters or
arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments that would be reasonably likely to affect the
amount or availability of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing. As of the of this Agreement,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (A) constitute a
default or breach of Parent or Merger Sub, or to the Knowledge of Parent, of any other party
thereto, under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments; (B) make any of the
assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any
material respect; (C) result in any of the conditions in the Financing Commitments not being
satisfied; or (D) otherwise result in or would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the
Financing not being available. Neither the Investor nor any Debt Financing Source has notified
Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate any of the Financing Commitments or not to
provide the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section
5.2, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it
with respect to the Financing Commitments or that the full amount of the Financing will not be
available as of the Closing. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Financing Commitments (or the Fee Letter) required to be paid on or prior to the
date of this Agreement. None of the Financing Commitments (or the Fee Letter) contains any
commitment fee or other fee payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Affiliates. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the debt and equity financing
required to be provided by Parent to pay the aggregate Merger consideration contemplated by
A-24
TABLE OF CONTENTS
this Agreement (including the payment by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2) and, together with cash
held by the Company and its Subsidiaries that is available to pay all costs, fees and expenses
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the obligations of the Debt Financing
Sources or Parent under the Financing Commitment, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments delivered by Parent to the Company on or prior to the date hereof and, in
the case of Parent, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Parent expressly
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereunder is not subject to obtaining the
Financing (or any other financing) for or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.
(f) Capitalization of Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned
by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any
business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(g) Brokers and Finders. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) has
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s
fees in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement, except
that Parent has employed Citibank, N.A., Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of America as its financial
advisors.
(h) Solvency. Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the
Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, payment of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and payment of all related fees and expenses and (ii) the Company is Solvent immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective
Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term “Solvent” when used with respect any Person means that, immediately
following the Effective Time, (i)(A) the fair value of the assets of such Person will exceed the amount of
all liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of such Person, and (B) the amount of the Present Fair Salable
Value of its assets will, as of such time, exceed the probable value of all of its debts and liabilities on a
consolidated basis, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
matured, (ii) the Person will not have, as of such time, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
business in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (iii) the Person will be able to pay its Debts as
they become absolute and mature. The term “Solvency” shall have its correlative meaning. For
purposes of the definition of “Solvent”: (A) “Debt” means liability on a Claim; and (B) “Claim” means any
right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. “Present
Fair Salable Value” means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Person
(including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction
under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises. For purposes of this
definition, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or
will be engaged” and “able to pay its Debts as they become absolute and mature” means that such
Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. No transfer is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company.
(i) Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Other than as a result of this Agreement, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is, or at any time during the last three years has been,
an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is used under Rule 13d-
3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or has at any time during the last three years beneficially
owned, any Shares or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to
acquire Shares or other securities of, or any economic interest (through derivative securities or
otherwise) in, the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(j) Proxy Statement. None of the information to be supplied in writing by Parent, Merger Sub or any
Representative of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, if any, will, at the time
such document is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to any information
supplied by the Company or any of its Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement.
(k) Stockholder and Management Arrangements. As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub
nor any of their Affiliates has entered into any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or
committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understanding (whether
or not binding) with any stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (in their capacities as such) (i) relating to (A) this Agreement; (B) the Company or
(C) the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to
continuing employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (ii) pursuant to which (A) any holder of
Shares would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of such holder’s Shares; or (B) any holder of Shares has agreed to
approve this Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal, in each case, that is currently in effect
or that would become effective in the future (upon consummation of the Merger or otherwise) and that
has not been disclosed.
(l) Investment Intention. Parent, through Merger Sub, is acquiring through the Merger the shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with
a view of the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof in violation
of the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub understand that the shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the Securities Act or any “blue sky” Laws and
cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, any applicable “blue sky”
Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such registration.
(m) Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Guarantor has
delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default on the part of
Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

shall instruct its and their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing solicitation, initiation, discussion or negotiation with any Person conducted
heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries, indications of interest, proposals or offers that
would reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, in each case, other than (A)
directing such Persons to the provisions contained in this Section 4.2 or (B) following receipt of an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, contacting such Person or its Representatives solely to clarify the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4.2(c)
below, (ii) promptly following the date hereof (and in any event within three business days after the date

(and in any event within one business day after the date of this Agreement), terminate access to any

“standstill” or similar obligation solely to make an unsolicited and nonpublic Acquisition Proposal in
compliance with this Section 4.2 or from granting such a waiver, in each case, to the extent that such
waiver is required for such Person to make an unsolicited and nonpublic Acquisition Proposal to the
Company in compliance with this Section 4.2.
(b) Subject to Sections 4.2(c) and 4.2(e), from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VI, the Company shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries, and shall direct, and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their

bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that is not preceded by a breach
of this Section 4.2, (i) provide information (including access to the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) in response to a request therefor by the Person who has made such written Acquisition
Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable in the

any event within 24 hours thereafter), (ii) contact a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, and (iii) engage or

described in clause (c)(i) or (c)(iii) above, (A) the Company Board determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) the Company Board
has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with its
has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with its

sensitive non-public information to any competitor of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
the actions permitted by this Section 4.2(c), except in accordance with “clean room” or other similar
procedures designed to limit any adverse effect of the sharing of such information on the Company and
its Subsidiaries.
(d) Except as permitted pursuant to Sections 4.2(e) and 4.2(g), the Company Board shall not (i)
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof (a
“Change of Recommendation”), (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract,
except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (each, a “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), in
each case constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to result in, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (iv) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (v) fail to expressly reaffirm publicly
the Company Recommendation within 10 business days following Parent’s or Merger Sub’s written
request to do so if an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or disclosed (or, with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such previously
publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal that are publicly disclosed within the last 10 business days
prior to the then-scheduled Stockholders Meeting, fail to take the actions referred to in this clause (v),
with references to the 10 business day period being replaced with three business days).
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, following
receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the date of this Agreement that is not
preceded by a breach of this Section 4.2, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that have been offered by Parent pursuant to this Section 4.2, the Company Board may
make a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided that prior to
taking any such action, (x) the Company has given Parent five business days’ notice of its intention to
take such action (which notice shall state the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, such Superior Proposal, and include a copy of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents and a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto) (a “Change Notice”), (y) the Company has negotiated in good
faith (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) with Parent during such notice period to enable Parent
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that the Company Board would no longer determine that the
failure to make such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (z) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall
have determined, in good faith, taking into account any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions
proposed by Parent were to be given effect and that the failure to make such Change of
Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
Law (provided further that each material amendment to the financial terms of the Superior Proposal shall
be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and Company Board may not make a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 4.2(e) unless the Company has complied with the
requirements of this Section 4.2(e) with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal including
sending a Change Notice with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal and offering to Parent to
negotiate for three business days from the date each such subsequent Change Notice is delivered).
(f) The Company agrees that it will within 24 hours notify Parent if any inquiries, indications of interest,
proposals or offers with respect to, or that are reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making or delivering such inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal or offer, the material terms and conditions of such inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal or offer and any draft agreement or other relevant transaction documents provided in
connection therewith and thereafter shall keep Parent

reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal or offer (including by notifying Parent in writing of any amendments or material
changes thereto within 24 hours of receipt thereof by the Company) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company’s intentions as previously notified.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time
the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company Board may make a Change of
Recommendation for a reason unrelated to a Superior Proposal if the Company Board determines, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that (i) an Intervening Event occurred and (ii)
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; provided that prior to taking any such action, (x) the Company has given Parent five business
days’ notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonably detailed description of such
Intervening Event that serves as the basis of the Change of Recommendation as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of it, (y) the Company has negotiated in good faith (to the extent
Parent requests to negotiate) with Parent during such notice period to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the basis for making such Change of
Recommendation and (z) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, taking into account any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in

not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case other than in connection with the

Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to

proposal or offer with respect to a merger, sale, joint venture, partnership, license, consolidation,

Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any required filing by the Company, as the case
may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the party that discovers such

a Change of Recommendation as a result of an Intervening Event, use reasonable best efforts to solicit
from the holders of Shares proxies in favor of the approval of the Agreement. The Company may

to and/or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divesture or

contemplated by this Agreement by the Closing Date; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to take any such steps with respect to

agreement relating thereto, or the consummation of such acquisition, or the taking of any other
action, would cause the failure to obtain the termination or expiration of the waiting period pursuant
to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger or result in any Governmental
Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger.
(v) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this Section 4.5(c) shall not

permit any of its officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger

Clearance so as to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by the Closing Date, including providing all such assurances as may be necessary, requested or
imposed by the French Treasury, including entering into a letter of undertaking, letter of assurance,
proxy agreement or other similar arrangement or agreement, in relation to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.5(f)(ii) shall be construed to require
Parent to undertake any efforts or to take any action if the taking of such efforts or action is or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Change (limited, for
purposes of this Section 4.5(f)(ii), to clause (y) of the definition thereof).
(iii) Parent shall be responsible for obtaining the Foreign Investment Clearance and shall not take
any action (including entering into any transaction, agreement or other arrangement) that is or
would reasonably be expected to make it more difficult to obtain the Foreign Investment Clearance
or to result in any material delay in obtaining the same.

that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 6.5(b) or Section
6.5(d) or any portion thereof or against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 6.5(c) or any portion
thereof, as applicable, the Company shall pay to Parent or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the
case may be, its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) in connection with such
legal proceeding (such foregoing amounts, “Collection Costs”; provided, that in no event shall the
Collection Costs exceed $10,000,000).

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement, the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or in the event of any actual or threatened breach of this
Agreement, and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is
accordingly agreed that, except where this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article
VI, the parties (on behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in
Section 7.9) shall, subject to Section 7.6(b), be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof. The parties hereby further acknowledge and
agree that, subject to Section 7.6(b), such relief shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, if each of the
conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions
which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at the Closing) and the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.2. The
parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 7.6, a party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief, at law or in equity, that may be available to a
party under this Agreement, including, subject to Section 6.5, monetary damages in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 7.6 are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this Section 7.6 shall require any
party to institute any action or proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 7.6 before exercising any termination right under Article VI (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any action or proceeding
pursuant to this Section 7.6 or anything contained in this Section 7.6 restrict or limit any party’s right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VI or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges and
agrees that it hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with such relief.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, including Section 7.6(a), the
right of the Company to seek specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing shall only be available if (i) all
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 have been satisfied (other than any
condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing but each of which would be satisfied if
the Closing were to occur) at a time when the

Closing would have otherwise occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded
in accordance with its terms or will be funded in accordance with its terms at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that all
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 5.3 have been satisfied (or waived) and if specific performance
is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur
pursuant to Section 1.2. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be entitled to seek (but shall
not be entitled to receive) both a grant of specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations
to consummate the Closing hereunder and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.",157,158
