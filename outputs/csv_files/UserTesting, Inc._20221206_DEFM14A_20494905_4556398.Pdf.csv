The Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and

any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. The time at which the Merger will become
effective will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the “DGCL”) (the time of such filing and the acceptance for record by the Secretary of State of the

Treatment of Company Equity Awards

Each option to purchase shares of UserTesting common stock (each, a “Company Option”) that is
vested in accordance with its terms and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
“Vested Company Option”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (ii) the

however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common stock of such Vested Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Option will be cancelled
without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not a
Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested Company Option”) will, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the
total number of shares of UserTesting common stock underlying such Unvested Company Option (the

that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common stock of such Unvested Company Option is equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Unvested Company Option will be cancelled
without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option
Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option
from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would have vested and been
payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company Option Consideration (without
limitation to any rights that the holder may have under any agreement with the Company in effect on the date
of the Merger Agreement).

RSU”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and either (x) held by a non-employee
member of the Board of Directors (whether vested or unvested) or (y) vested in accordance with its terms as
of the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company RSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of UserTesting
common stock underlying such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to
applicable withholding taxes.
Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and not a Vested
Company RSU (each, an “Unvested Company RSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on

The receipt of cash by our stockholders in exchange for shares of UserTesting common stock in the
Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by a U.S.
Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of UserTesting common stock surrendered pursuant to the
Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
with respect to the exchange of UserTesting common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S.
Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption
from backup withholding tax.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - U.S.

If the Merger is consummated, UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners who continuously hold
or own shares of UserTesting common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw
their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares
in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that record holders and beneficial
owners of UserTesting common stock may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court
of Chancery, and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of UserTesting common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together
with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be “fair value,” if any, as determined by the court (or in
certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger - Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the “fair value” and the
amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each person entitled to appraisal prior to the
entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who
wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights.
UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the
“fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same
as, or less than the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the
Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of UserTesting common stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, record holders and beneficial owners of UserTesting common stock must:
(i) properly submit a written demand for appraisal to us before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt
4 • 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement; (iii) hold or own such shares upon the making of a demand under clause (i) and continue to hold
or own their shares of UserTesting common stock through the Effective Time; (iv) not thereafter withdraw
their demand for appraisal of their shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, each in accordance with the
DGCL; and (v) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights.
In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of UserTesting
unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners
seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in
this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the
DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy
statement. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger -

Two lawsuits have been filed in federal courts against UserTesting and its directors: O’Dell v.
UserTesting, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-10071 (S.D.N.Y.), and Glanville v. UserTesting, Inc., et al., 3:22-cv-07568
(N.D. Cal.) (collectively, the “Stockholder Litigation”). The complaints name UserTesting and our directors as
defendants. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14a-19 promulgated thereunder, and generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement misrepresents
and/or omits certain purportedly material information relating to the Merger, including allegations relating to
the background of the Merger, financial projections, analyses of our financial advisor and conflicts of
interest by company insiders in pursuing the Merger. The complaints seek a variety of equitable and
injunctive relief including, among other things, an injunction enjoining the consummation of the Merger,
rescission of the Merger Agreement, rescission of the Merger if it is consummated, rescissory damages and
costs and attorneys’ fees. We have not yet responded to the complaints filed in the Stockholder Litigation.
In addition, three purported stockholders of UserTesting sent demand letters regarding the preliminary
proxy statement (the “Demand Letters”). Based on the same core allegations as the Stockholder Litigation,
the Demand Letters request that we disseminate corrective disclosures in an amendment or supplement to
the preliminary proxy statement.
We believe the Stockholder Litigation and the Demand Letters are without merit, but there can be no
assurance that we will ultimately prevail in the Stockholder Litigation or all such lawsuits. Additionally,
additional lawsuits may be filed and demand letters may be sent before the Special Meeting and/or the
consummation of the Merger.",13,13

When considering the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, UserTesting stockholders should be aware that certain of our
non-employee directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in
addition to, those of our stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these
interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, approving the Merger
Agreement and the Merger, and recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by our stockholders.
These interests include:
at the Effective Time, each Company Option and Company RSU held by an executive officer or
director will receive the treatment described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger - Interests of Our Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger - Treatment and
Quantification of Company Equity Awards”;
eligibility of our executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits (including equity
award vesting acceleration) under their change in control and severance agreements, as described in
more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Our Executive
Officers and Directors in the Merger - Change in Control and Severance Agreements”; and
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the
Surviving Corporation.
In addition, upon completion of the Merger, it is anticipated that our Chief Executive Officer and,
potentially, other members of our management team, will serve as members of the management team of the
Surviving Corporation. Following the closing of the transaction, Thoma Bravo and Sunstone Partners intend
to combine UserTesting and UserZoom. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers
has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to
purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to and
following the closing of the Merger, however, certain of our executive officers may have discussions, and
following the closing of the Merger, may enter into agreements with, Parent or Merger Sub, their subsidiaries
or their respective controlled affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in
the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of UserTesting common stock
held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as issued and outstanding
shares of UserTesting common stock held by all other UserTesting stockholders except as may be provided
for pursuant to specific agreements. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned

The Go-Shop Period - Solicitation of Other Alternative Acquisition Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on
December 10, 2022 (such date, the “No-Shop Period Start Date” and, such period, the “Go-Shop Period”), we
and our subsidiaries and respective representatives have the right to, among other things: (i) solicit, initiate,
propose, induce the making or submission of, encourage or facilitate in any way any offer or proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (as defined in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Go-
Shop Period - Solicitation of Other Offers”), including by providing information (including non-public
information and data) of or affording access to UserTesting and our subsidiaries to any third person that has
entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the section of this proxy

statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Go-Shop Period - Solicitation of
Other Offers”); and (ii) continue, enter into, engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any third person regarding any Alternative Acquisition Proposals, and cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or facilitate in any way, any such inquiries, offers, proposals, discussions or
negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Alternative Acquisition Proposals or other proposals that
could reasonably be expected to lead to Alternative Acquisition Proposals, including by granting a waiver,
amendment or release under any pre-existing “standstill” or other similar provision to the extent necessary to
allow for an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or amendment to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal to be
made confidentially to UserTesting or to the Board of Directors. To date, we have not received any offer or
proposal that constituted, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal
during the Go-Shop Period.
The No-Shop Period - No Solicitation of Other Alternative Acquisition Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the date on which the Merger Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to its terms (the “Termination
Date”), we may not: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate the making or
submission of any offer or proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-
public information to, any person relating to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend any proposal that constitutes, or would be reasonably expected to lead to, an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) enter into any contract relating to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, other
than a confidentiality agreement permitted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under certain specified circumstances, from the No-Shop Period Start
Date until the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, we may, among other things, engage
in negotiations or discussions with, and provide information to, a third party (and its representatives and
potential debt and equity financing sources) in respect of an Alternative Acquisition Proposal that was not
received in response to or as a result of our obligations set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Go-Shop
Period - Solicitation of Other Offers”) or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and the
Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith that the failure to take the actions in
respect of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The No-Shop Period - No Solicitation of Other Offers.”
Both during the Go-Shop Period and after the No-Shop Period Start Date but prior to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by our stockholders, we are entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal only if it complies with certain procedures in the
Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a four (4)-
business-day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and other
agreements so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal relative to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, amended pursuant to such negotiations.
The termination of the Merger Agreement by us following the Board of Directors’ authorization for us to enter
into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal will result
in the payment by us of a termination fee of either (i) $10,160,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated before 11:59
p.m. Pacific Time on December 20, 2022 for the purpose of entering into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal received from an Excluded Party and we have complied in all material respects with the non-solicitation
provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal or (ii) $33,880,000, in the case
of any other such termination. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What will I receive in respect of my shares of UserTesting common stock if the Merger is completed?
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration of
$7.50 in cash, subject to applicable withholding taxes, for each share of UserTesting common stock that
you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL.
For example, if you own 100 shares of UserTesting common stock, you will receive $750.00 in cash in
exchange for your shares of UserTesting common stock, subject to applicable withholding taxes.
What will the holders of outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs receive if the Merger is completed?
Upon completion of the Merger:
Each Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option, by (y) the total
number of shares of UserTesting common stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to
applicable withholding taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting
common stock of such Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Vested Company Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other
consideration being made in respect thereof.
Each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option, by (y) the total
number of shares of UserTesting common stock underlying such Unvested Company Option, subject to
applicable withholding taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting
common stock of such Unvested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Unvested Company Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other
consideration being made in respect thereof. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and
its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting
dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the
same time as the Unvested Company Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration
was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain
exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt
of the Unvested Company Option Consideration (without limitation to any rights that the holder may
have under any agreement with the Company in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement).
Each Vested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of UserTesting common stock
underlying such Vested Company RSU, by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to applicable
withholding taxes.
Each Unvested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of UserTesting common
stock underlying such Unvested Company RSU, by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to
applicable withholding taxes. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such
Unvested Company RSU Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the
Unvested Company RSU from which such Unvested Company RSU Consideration, was converted
would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will
otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying
Unvested

Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested
Company RSU Consideration (without limitation to any rights that the holder may have under any
agreement with the Company in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement).
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of UserTesting
common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any UserTesting stockholder of record to: (i)
submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions
provided in the enclosed proxy card); or (iii) vote in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold
your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will
have no effect on any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting. Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement but will have no effect on any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date
or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the
time of the Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing
how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will
be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the
Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our capital stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date must be present at the Special
Meeting in order to hold the Special Meeting and conduct business. This presence is called a quorum.
Your shares are counted as present at the Special Meeting if you are present and vote at the Special
Meeting or if you have properly submitted a proxy.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any
other reason, UserTesting stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of UserTesting
common stock. Instead, we will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file
periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of either (i)
$10,160,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated before December 20, 2022 for the purpose of entering
into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal received from an Excluded Party (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Go-
Shop Period - Solicitation of Other Offers”) or (ii) $33,880,000, in the case of any other such termination,
as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement - Termination Fee.”
What do I need to do now?
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy
statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we
refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the
Merger and how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy

card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be
voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to
vote your shares.
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262
of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, UserTesting stockholders of record who do not vote in favor of
adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the “fair value” of their shares as
determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware if the merger is completed. Appraisal
rights will only be available to UserTesting stockholders who properly deliver, and do not properly
withdraw, a written demand for an appraisal to UserTesting prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal
amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a UserTesting stockholder would be
entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is
included as Annex C to this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled “The
Merger - Appraisal Rights.”
Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
No. After the Merger is completed, the paying agent will send each holder of record a letter of
transmittal and written instructions that explain how to exchange shares of UserTesting common stock
represented by such holder’s book-entry shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of UserTesting common stock after the Record Date but
before the Special Meeting?
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the
Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of UserTesting common stock
after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of
a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and
each of you notifies UserTesting in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell
or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even
if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of UserTesting common stock after the Record Date, we
encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or
grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the
enclosed proxy card). In addition, if you sell your shares prior to the Effective Time, you will not be
eligible to exercise your appraisal rights in respect of the Merger. For a more detailed discussion of your
appraisal rights and the requirements for properly demanding your appraisal rights, please see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Appraisal Rights.”
What is the difference between holding shares as a UserTesting stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “UserTesting
stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to
you by UserTesting.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial
owner” of shares of UserTesting common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement
has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the UserTesting stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right
to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for
voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the

stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain
a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
How may I vote?
If you are a UserTesting stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of UserTesting common stock are
registered in your name with AST, our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply
envelope;
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and
completing a virtual ballot.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote
your shares of UserTesting common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been
properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions
provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your
shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by
telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as
Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your
shares of UserTesting common stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy”
to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of UserTesting common stock
in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are
present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not
be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through
your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee,
electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your
bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your
bank, broker or nominee.
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently
scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals,
which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have
no effect on the adjournment proposal.
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
Yes. If you are a UserTesting stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at
any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing
a virtual ballot.

If you hold your shares of UserTesting common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank,
broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in
person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of UserTesting common stock.
The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is
called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of UserTesting
common stock is called a “proxy card.” Andy MacMillan, our President, Chief Executive Officer and
Chairperson of the Board of Directors, and Mona Sabet, our Chief Corporate Strategy Officer and
Corporate Secretary, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of substitution and
re-substitution.
If a UserTesting stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or
your proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or
telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or
against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before
the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be
voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary
or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement
at the time of the Special Meeting.
What should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials?
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using
the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that
you receive.
You may receive more than one (1) set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy
statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in
more than one (1) brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each
brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a UserTesting stockholder of record and your
shares are registered in more than one (1) name, you will receive more than one (1) proxy card.
Who will count the votes?
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by
ballot at the Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is
present.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
We intend to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC
following the Special Meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For
more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of UserTesting common stock for cash pursuant to
the Merger?
The exchange of UserTesting common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”)
who exchanges shares of UserTesting common stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with
respect to such shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a

Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income
tax to you unless you have certain connections with the United States, but may be subject to U.S.
backup withholding tax unless you comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish a
valid exemption from U.S. backup withholding tax.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger.”
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete
the Merger in the first half of 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be
predicted, because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement,
many of which are outside of our control.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
The expenses of soliciting proxies will be paid by us. We have retained Mackenzie Partners, Inc. to
assist in soliciting proxies for a fee of up to $20,000, plus costs and expenses. We and our agents may
solicit proxies by mail, electronic mail, telephone, facsimile, by other similar means or in person. Our
directors, officers and other employees, without additional compensation, and employees of Mackenzie
Partners, Inc. may solicit proxies personally or in writing, by telephone, email or otherwise. We will
request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders to forward copies of the soliciting
materials to persons for whom they hold shares and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In
such cases, we, upon the request of the record holders, will reimburse such holders for their reasonable
expenses. If you choose to access the proxy materials through the internet, you are responsible for any
internet access charges you may incur.
What if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the
virtual meeting website?
We will have technicians ready to assist you with any technical difficulties you may have accessing the
virtual meeting website. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the Special Meeting during the
check-in time or during the Special Meeting, please call the technical support number that will be posted
on the Special Meeting log-in page.
Do any of UserTesting’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ
from those of UserTesting stockholders generally?
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests
in the Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of UserTesting stockholders generally. The
Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at
the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in
making their respective recommendations and determinations, including in the case of the Board of
Directors, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted by UserTesting stockholders. For a description of the interests of our directors
and executive officers in the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Our Executive
Officers and Directors in the Merger.”

Only our stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and
to vote at the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 146,859,078 shares of UserTesting common
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. For ten days prior to the Special
Meeting, a complete list of the UserTesting stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be
available for examination by any stockholder for any purpose relating to the Special Meeting upon a written
request by such stockholder to our Investor Relations team at ir@usertesting.com. A list of UserTesting
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will also be available at the virtual meeting website
during the Special Meeting.
The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our capital stock issued and outstanding

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of UserTesting
common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of the
Record Date, 73,429,540 votes constitute a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common
stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders is a condition to the Closing of the Merger.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if a quorum is present, requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock entitled
to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and are voted for or
against the matter.
If a UserTesting stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the
UserTesting stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no
effect on any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (provided a
quorum is present with respect to the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement).
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement but will have no effect on any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting (provided a quorum is present with respect to the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement). A
so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting
upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a
particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not
received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. We do not expect any broker

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners who continuously hold
or own shares of UserTesting common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw
their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares
in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that record holders and beneficial
owners of UserTesting common stock who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their
demand for appraisal and who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262
24 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of UserTesting common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be “fair value,” if
any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger - Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the “fair value”
and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each person entitled to appraisal prior to
the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons
who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair
value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less
than the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if
they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) properly submit a written demand for appraisal to us
before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise
vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) hold or own such shares upon the making
of a demand under clause (i) and continue to hold or own your shares of UserTesting common stock through
the Effective Time; (iv) not thereafter withdraw your demand for appraisal of your shares or otherwise lose
your appraisal rights, each in accordance with the DGCL; and (v) strictly comply with all other procedures
for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock
ownership conditions are satisfied by the UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners seeking appraisal.
The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262

Merger Consideration
UserTesting Common Stock
At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of UserTesting common stock (other than the
Excluded Shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a U.S. bank or trust
company, approved in advance by us in writing that shall be appointed to act as a paying agent (the “Paying
Agent”) an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable at
Closing. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of UserTesting common stock that you own (less any applicable withholding taxes),
but you will no longer have any rights as a UserTesting stockholder (except that UserTesting stockholders
who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their
shares determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law). For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that UserTesting’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment as of the Effective Time:
Company Options
Each Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration
over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of
UserTesting common stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to applicable withholding
taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common stock of such Vested
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Vested Company
Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (ii)
the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of
UserTesting common stock underlying such Unvested Company Option, subject to applicable withholding
taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common stock of such Unvested
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Unvested Company
Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration
amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option from which such
Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would have vested pursuant and been payable to
its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company Option Consideration (without limitation to any rights that
the holder may have under any agreement with the Company in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement).
Company RSUs
Each Vested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
29 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of UserTesting common stock
underlying such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to applicable
withholding taxes.
Each Unvested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of UserTesting common stock underlying
such Unvested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to applicable withholding
taxes. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company RSU
Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU from
which such Unvested Company RSU Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable
pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company RSU Consideration (without limitation to any
rights that the holder may have under any agreement with the Company in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement).
Treatment of Company ESPP
In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, on October 26, 2022, the Board of Directors
adopted resolutions providing that with respect to the Company ESPP, (i) participation in the Company ESPP
will be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) participants
may not increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those in effect on the date of
the Merger Agreement or make any separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following
the date of the Merger Agreement, (iii) no offering or purchase period will be commenced after the date of the
Merger Agreement, (iv) each then-outstanding purchase right shall be exercised as of the earlier of (A) the
end of the offering or purchase period in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement or (B) ten (10) days
prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs, and (v) the Company ESPP will terminate immediately
prior to, but contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of
purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP). On such
exercise date, we will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each
participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of UserTesting common stock in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each
participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not used
to purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP, be refunded to such
participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest).",36,38

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the
Merger Agreement. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the
Board, the Transaction Committee or our representatives and other parties.
As part of our ongoing consideration and evaluation of UserTesting’s long-term strategic goals and
plans, the Board and our management periodically review, consider and assess our operations and financial
performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This
review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business
combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, in each case, with a view towards
enhancing stockholder value.
On several occasions in 2020 and 2021, we met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and discussed our
company and potential transactions involving us and Thoma Bravo, including a potential investment in or
acquisition of us by Thoma Bravo.
30 TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the second half of 2021, as we prepared for our initial public offering, we also evaluated a sale
transaction as a potential alternative to create value for our stockholders. Accordingly, in the third quarter of
2021, we instructed representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), a lead underwriter in
our initial public offering, to contact certain strategic and financial sponsor counterparties to determine
whether they would be interested in discussing a potential acquisition of our company at a valuation that
would be attractive compared to the valuation we expected to receive in an initial public offering. However, in
view of market conditions at the time and the high valuations companies in our industry were receiving
during their own initial public offerings, we determined that pursuing an initial public offering was in the best
interests of our stockholders.
On November 17, 2021, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock at a price of $14.00
per share. Following the initial public offering, the price of our common stock declined. During 2022 our
common stock traded below the initial public offering price, with a volume weighted average price of $5.65
during the 90-day period ending August 19, 2022 and a 52-week low of $3.31 per share in September 2022.
During 2022, equity securities of other companies in the software industry generally also experienced
significant declines.
In July 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo reached out to Andy MacMillan, our Chief
Executive Officer, and suggested a meeting to explore the potential for an acquisition of us by Thoma Bravo.
On August 19, 2022, Mr. MacMillan and Jon Pexton, our Chief Financial Officer, met with representatives
of Thoma Bravo, including A.J. Rohde, Senior Partner at Thoma Bravo, and David Tse, Vice President at
Thoma Bravo, to learn more about our company and to explore the potential for an acquisition of us by
Thoma Bravo (the “Proposed Transaction”). At this meeting, the senior representative of Thoma Bravo
informed Messrs. MacMillan and Pexton that Thoma Bravo was evaluating making a proposal for a potential
acquisition of us at a price of between $9.00 and $11.00 per share, representing a premium of approximately
84% to 125% over our closing stock price of $4.88 on August 18, 2022, subject to customary due diligence,
and that following the consummation of a transaction, Thoma Bravo would expect to integrate our business
with that of its portfolio company UserZoom. At this meeting, Thoma Bravo also discussed the possibility of
Mr. MacMillan serving as the chief executive officer of the combined companies. However, as of the date of
this proxy statement, Thoma Bravo and Mr. MacMillan have not discussed specific terms for Mr. MacMillan
to act in such capacity.
On August 26, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton and Mona Sabet, our Chief Corporate
Strategy Officer, and representatives of Fenwick & West LLP, our outside corporate counsel (“Fenwick &
West”), were present. Mr. MacMillan informed the Board of the discussions with Thoma Bravo, including his
anticipated role following the consummation of a transaction. At the meeting, representatives of Fenwick &
West reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a potential business combination
transaction and considerations with respect to a process for such a transaction. Mr. Pexton then discussed
our anticipated financial results as an independent company. In light of the discussions with Thoma Bravo,
the Board determined to retain financial advisors, and directed our senior management to contact Morgan
Stanley and another investment bank that specializes in mergers and acquisitions, which we refer to as
“Advisor A,” for that purpose, based on both of these banks’ experience with acquisition transactions in our
industry and, specifically in the case of Morgan Stanley, their experience with our company (as they had
served as a lead underwriter in our initial public offering), and in advising companies in acquisition
transactions with Thoma Bravo.
On August 29, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of
Fenwick & West and Advisor A were present. At the meeting, representatives of Advisor A presented to the
Board with respect to the Proposed Transaction, including Advisor A’s credentials, the current market
environment, perspectives on our financial performance and trading price, and process objectives and
considerations.
On August 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of
Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley and
the Board discussed the Proposed Transaction, including Morgan Stanley’s credentials, our positioning in
the market, perspectives on our financial performance and trading price, and potential parties that might be
31 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
interested in, and capable of, completing an acquisition of us. Morgan Stanley reviewed possible next steps
with respect to the Proposed Transaction for the Board to consider. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then
left the meeting and the Board discussed the Proposed Transaction and the presentations by Advisor A and
Morgan Stanley. The Board then determined to engage Morgan Stanley as our financial advisor in
connection with the Proposed Transaction because of, among other things, Morgan Stanley’s familiarity with
our business based on its existing relationship with us, its qualifications, expertise and reputation, extensive
expertise and experience with transactions in our industry, and its prior experience negotiating numerous
transactions with Thoma Bravo. The Board then discussed the potential process for, and Board oversight
and management of, the Proposed Transaction, including the formation of a strategic review committee of the
Board to manage and oversee the Proposed Transaction (the “Transaction Committee”). The Board
established the Transaction Committee, composed of Shannon Nash, Cynthia Russo and Alexander Wong, to
consider, oversee, manage and direct the process for a Proposed Transaction. The Board then directed our
management to coordinate a response to Thoma Bravo with representatives of Morgan Stanley, and to
inform Thoma Bravo that it should provide a written indication of interest with a specific price and that such
price should be in the upper half of the range of the verbal proposal provided by the senior representative of
Thoma Bravo on August 19, 2022.
On September 2, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted
representatives of Thoma Bravo to convey the message from the Board. Representatives of Thoma Bravo
indicated that they would continue to consider valuation.
On September 6, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting at which the other members of the
Board, Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At
the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the discussion that had occurred with Thoma
Bravo on September 2, 2022. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then left the meeting and Mr. Pexton
reviewed a financial forecast for 2023 through 2025 (the “September Financial Forecast”), a copy of which
had been provided to the Board for review prior to the meeting. The Transaction Committee then discussed
the Proposed Transaction, including the update provided by Morgan Stanley, and the September Financial
Forecast. Ms. Sabet and representatives of Fenwick & West reviewed the terms set forth in a proposed
engagement letter with Morgan Stanley. The Transaction Committee then discussed the possibility of
contacting other parties that might potentially be interested in, and capable of, completing an acquisition of
us, the potential risks of such a process, the potential adverse consequences of information regarding the
Proposed Transaction if it were to become publicly known at this time, including the increased risk that a
broad outreach would become publicly known, which could disrupt our business, and the possibility of
contacting other potential acquirors through a “go shop” process following an announcement of the
Potential Transaction.
On September 8, 2022, Thoma Bravo and UserZoom jointly submitted a non-binding indication of
interest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $9.50 per share in an all-cash
transaction (the “September 8 Proposal”), subject to customary due diligence and representing a premium of
approximately 137% over our closing stock price of $4.01 on September 7, 2022. The September 8 Proposal
contemplated a 30-day exclusivity period during which we could not solicit alternative proposals prior to
execution of a merger agreement and that we would not engage in a “go-shop” process following execution
of a merger agreement (subject to a “fiduciary out” with respect to unsolicited proposals). We provided a
copy of the September 8 Proposal to the members of the Board later that day.
Later on September 8, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting at which Messrs. MacMillan and
Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting,
Mr. MacMillan and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the September 8 Proposal, and the
Transaction Committee discussed potential responses to the September 8 Proposal.
On September 10, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of
Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley
reviewed certain financial aspects of the September 8 Proposal and provided an overview of our financial and
stock performance since our initial public offering and its views on the current market environment. The
Board discussed with representatives of Morgan Stanley preliminary perspectives on our proposed
valuation, and discussed our prospects as an independent company. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and
the Board then discussed the September 8 Proposal, views on strategic parties and other private equity
sponsors
32 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that might be interested in evaluating, and capable of completing, a potential business combination
transaction with us, and our response to the September 8 Proposal. The representatives from Morgan
Stanley then left the meeting and the Board discussed the terms of the proposed engagement letter between
UserTesting and Morgan Stanley, and directed us to execute the engagement letter. A representative of
Fenwick & West then reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a response to Thoma
Bravo. The Board then further discussed the response to the September 8 Proposal and determined to
respond to Thoma Bravo that we were interested in discussing a transaction but instructed our management
to seek to obtain a higher price per share from Thoma Bravo.
Following this meeting, on September 10, 2022, we executed the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley
on the terms approved by the Board.
On September 12, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with a
senior representative of Thoma Bravo and informed him that we were interested in discussing a transaction
but pressed Thoma Bravo to increase its proposed price per share consistent with the guidance previously
provided by the Board. The senior representative of Thoma Bravo indicated that they would continue to
evaluate its proposed price per share.
On September 14, 2022, Thoma Bravo and UserZoom submitted a revised non-binding indication of
interest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $10.00 per share (the “September 14
Proposal”), subject to customary due diligence and representing a premium of approximately 151% over our
closing stock price of $3.98 on September 14, 2022. Similar to the September 8 Proposal, the September 14
Proposal contemplated a 30-day exclusivity period during which we could not solicit alternative proposals
prior to execution of a merger agreement and that we would not engage in a “go-shop” process following
execution of a merger agreement (subject to a “fiduciary out” with respect to unsolicited proposals). We
provided a copy of the September 14 Proposal to the members of the Board later that day.
On September 16, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of
Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley
reviewed with the Board certain financial aspects of the September 14 Proposal and provided an update with
respect to the discussions that Morgan Stanley had with Thoma Bravo since September 10, 2022. The Board
then discussed with representatives of Morgan Stanley preliminary perspectives on our valuation, and the
Board and representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed strategic parties and other private equity sponsors
that might potentially be interested in evaluating, and capable of completing, a potential business
combination transaction with us, including potential strategies for soliciting proposals from such parties,
either prior to execution of a merger agreement or through a go-shop process following execution of a merger
agreement, and our proposed response to the September 14 Proposal. The representatives of Morgan
Stanley left the meeting, and the Board continued to discuss the response to the September 14 Proposal.
During this discussion, a representative of Fenwick & West reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in
connection with a response to Thoma Bravo and in evaluating a process to solicit interest in a transaction
from other parties. Following this discussion, the Board determined to direct Morgan Stanley to inform
Thoma Bravo that we were willing to proceed to due diligence, and negotiation of a merger agreement, based
on the September 14 Proposal, but would not agree to any exclusivity period during which we could not
solicit alternative bids prior to execution of a merger agreement, and would require that any merger agreement
provide for a 45-day go shop period in which we could solicit proposals from other parties following
execution of a merger agreement. In addition, the Board determined to direct Morgan Stanley to contact a
financial sponsor with existing investments in our industry and a strategic party, which we refer to herein as
“Party A” and “Party B,” respectively, to discuss their interest in discussing an acquisition of us, as the
Board believed that Party A and Party B were most likely to be interested in evaluating, and capable of
completing, such a transaction at an attractive valuation. These two parties were among those previously
contacted regarding a potential acquisition of us in the third quarter of 2021 prior to our initial public
offering. The Board discussed the desirability of contacting other parties at this time in addition to these two
parties, and determined not to do so, and instead to solicit interest from other parties through a go-shop
process following execution of any definitive agreement providing for an acquisition of us, in view of the
increased risk that a broad outreach would become publicly known, which could disrupt our business.
On September 18, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with a
senior representative of Thoma Bravo and informed him that, based on the September 14 Proposal, we were
33 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
willing to allow Thoma Bravo to conduct due diligence, and begin negotiation of a merger agreement but that
we would not agree to any exclusivity period and would require a 45-day go shop period. The senior
representative of Thoma Bravo indicated that Thoma Bravo was willing to proceed without exclusivity and
would provide for a go shop period, the length of which would need to be determined in connection with
negotiating the definitive agreement.
On September 19, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Thoma Bravo
and discussed the anticipated due diligence process for the Proposed Transaction, including the need to
restrict UserZoom’s access to competitive information.
On September 19, 2022, a representative of Fenwick & West spoke with a representative of Kirkland &
Ellis LLP (“Kirkland & Ellis”), outside counsel to Thoma Bravo, regarding the process for drafting a merger
agreement.
On September 20, 2022, we entered into a letter agreement regarding confidentially (the “Confidentiality
Agreement”) with Thoma Bravo. The Confidentiality Agreement included a customary standstill provision
that did not include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision and was subject to a customary “fall-
away” provision under which it would terminate if we were to enter into a merger agreement with a third party
providing for a change of control transaction of our company. In addition, the Confidentiality Agreement
restricted the ability of Thoma Bravo to disclose our confidential information to UserZoom.
Following execution of the Confidentiality Agreement, on September 20, 2022, Messrs. MacMillian and
Pexton and Ms. Sabet met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and Sunstone Partners to provide a
management presentation and answer questions regarding our business, customers, strategy, financial
results and the September Financial Forecast, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in attendance. A copy
of the September Financial Forecast that was presented at this meeting was subsequently provided to Thoma
Bravo and its advisors.
Later on September 20, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted
Party A and Party B, respectively, to determine whether they would be interested in discussing a potential
acquisition of our company.
Later on September 20, 2022, a representative of Party A informed representatives of Morgan Stanley
that Party A was not currently interested in discussing an acquisition of us. On the same day, Party B
informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would consider whether it was interested in engaging in
any such discussions, and would respond at a later date once it had made such a determination.
On September 21, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of
Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, representatives of Fenwick & West
described the proposed terms of a draft Merger Agreement to be delivered to Thoma Bravo, including the
proposed transaction structure, treatment of unvested stock options and RSUs, closing conditions, potential
remedies for the failure of Thoma Bravo to close the Proposed Transaction, provision for a 45-day “go-shop”
process and termination fees payable in the event of a superior proposal from a third party. Representatives
of Morgan Stanley then provided an update on discussions with Thoma Bravo since the September 16, 2022
Board meeting. Representatives of Morgan Stanley informed the Board that Thoma Bravo had verbally
agreed that we would not be subject to an exclusivity period prior to signing of the Merger Agreement,
which would permit us to solicit alternative bids prior to signing of the Merger Agreement, and would permit
the inclusion of a “go-shop” provision in the Merger Agreement, which would enable us to solicit alternative
bids after signing of the Merger Agreement for a period of time. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then
informed the Board that Party A was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of us and that Party B had
indicated that it would consider whether it was interested in engaging in any such discussions, and that it
would respond at a later date once it had made such a determination.
On September 22, 2022, Thoma Bravo and its advisors were provided with access to a virtual data room
with diligence information regarding our company.
On September 23, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West sent an initial draft of a clean team
confidentiality agreement that had been prepared by Fenwick & West to representatives of Kirkland & Ellis
to apply to certain competitive information that had not yet been provided in the virtual data room, and
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
on September 25, 2022, we and Thoma Bravo executed the clean team agreement. On September 25, 2022,
pursuant to the clean team agreement, certain representatives of Thoma Bravo and representatives of
Kirkland & Ellis and other advisors to Thoma Bravo were provided with access to a clean team specific
virtual data room with sensitive diligence information regarding our company.
Later on September 23, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West sent an initial draft of the Merger
Agreement that had been prepared by Fenwick & West to representatives of Kirkland & Ellis. The initial draft
Merger Agreement provided for (i) a “go-shop” provision in the Merger Agreement that would enable us to
solicit alternative bids for 45 days after signing, that had been previously agreed by the parties, (ii) Thoma
Bravo to pay us a reverse termination fee of 5.4% of the equity value, including if the Proposed Transaction
cannot close because of a failure to obtain necessary antitrust approvals or clearances, (iii) us to pay Thoma
Bravo a termination fee of 2.7% of the equity value under certain circumstances (0.9% with respect to a
proposal made during the “go-shop” period) and (iv) a portion of the unvested stock options and RSUs held
by employees be accelerated in the event that they were terminated without cause, or for “good reason”.
Later on September 23, 2022, a representative of Party B informed representatives of Morgan Stanley
that Party B would not be making a proposal to acquire us.
On September 25, 2022, Morgan Stanley provided us with a customary disclosure document describing
certain relationships between Morgan Stanley and representatives thereof on the one hand and UserTesting
and Thoma Bravo, and their respective affiliates, on the other hand. This disclosure document indicated,
among other matters, that Morgan Stanley or an affiliate thereof was a lender to certain portfolio companies
of Thoma Bravo, and acted as administrative agent with respect to credit facilities of two such portfolio
companies, including UserZoom. We provided a copy of this disclosure document to the Board on
September 26, 2022.
Between September 26, 2022 and October 3, 2022, members of our management conducted several
meetings with representatives of Thoma Bravo at which members of our management provided due diligence
presentations and answered questions. Representatives of Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis were in
attendance for the meetings with respect to legal matters.
On September 28, Mr. MacMillan met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and Sunstone Partners to
become better acquainted and to discuss our company.
On September 30, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West and representatives of Kirkland & Ellis
discussed the initial draft of the Merger Agreement. During this meeting, the representatives of Kirkland &
Ellis (i) proposed a “go-shop” period of 30 days, (ii) rejected our proposal that Thoma Bravo pay us a reverse
termination fee if the Proposed Transaction cannot close because of a failure to obtain necessary antitrust
approvals or clearances, (iii) proposed that we pay Thoma Bravo a termination fee of 3.0% of the equity if the
Merger Agreement was terminated under certain circumstances (1.5% with respect to a proposal made during
the “go-shop” period), and (iv) rejected our proposal that a portion of the unvested stock options and RSUs
held by employees be accelerated in the event that they were terminated without cause, or for “good
reason.”
Later on September 30, 2022, Messrs. MacMillan, Pexton, Satterwhite and Doktorczky and Mses. Sabet
and Mekhalfa, met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and discussed our anticipated third quarter financial
results, with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Ernst & Young in attendance. These anticipated results
included revenue and calculated billings (total revenue plus the change in contract liabilities from the
beginning to the end of the period, a non-GAAP financial measure that is indicative of amounts invoiced to
customers) that were lower than those anticipated by Wall Street analysts, Thoma Bravo and the September
Financial Forecast.
On October 3, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted representatives of Morgan
Stanley and informed them that, as a result of our third quarter financial results (and in particular, our
calculated billings for the quarter), trends in our end markets and the increased cost to Thoma Bravo to
secure debt financing for the Proposed Transaction in light of current debt market conditions, Thoma Bravo
was no longer willing to proceed at the previously proposed price of $10.00 per share but did not indicate a
price per share at which Thoma Bravo was willing to proceed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following that call, on October 3, 2022, as a result of Thoma Bravo’s indication that it would be reducing
the valuation, we instructed our advisors to cease engaging with Thoma Bravo’s advisors.
On October 4, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley and
verbally indicted that Thoma Bravo may be prepared to resume discussions at a price of $7.50 per share,
subject to further due diligence regarding our financial outlook and our go-to-market strategy (the “October
4 Proposal”). The October 4 Proposal represented a premium of approximately 95% over our closing stock
price of $3.84 on October 3, 2022.
Following that call, on October 4, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and
representatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, Mr. MacMillan and
representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the October 4 Proposal, including the rationales conveyed by
Thoma Bravo for the price decrease. Messrs. MacMillan and Pexton provided the Board an update on our
financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. A representative of Fenwick & West then
reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Board in considering the October 4 Proposal. Following discussion, the
Board directed representatives of Morgan Stanley and our management to reject the October 4 Proposal
because of the magnitude of the price decrease and the lack of certainty and specificity in the October 4
Proposal.
Later on October 4, 2022, a representative of Morgan Stanley contacted a senior representative of
Thoma Bravo and informed him that the Board had rejected the October 4 Proposal.
Later on October 4, 2022, the same senior representative of Thoma Bravo then contacted Mr. MacMillan
to reiterate Thoma Bravo’s rationale for its revised view of valuation.
On October 5, 2022, as a result of the Board’s determination, we terminated the engagement letter with
Morgan Stanley and also terminated the access of Thoma Bravo and its advisors to the virtual data room.
On October 9, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated
that it was evaluating its ability to proceed at a price of $7.50 per share, subject to further due diligence
regarding our financial outlook and our go-to-market strategy. Mr. MacMillan responded that, in light of the
Board’s previous direction regarding the October 4 Proposal, any proposal would need to provide us with
substantially greater certainty and specificity, and not be subject to any further due diligence that could
affect valuation.
On October 12, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated
that it would likely be willing to proceed at a price of $7.00 per share given market conditions, which
represented a premium of approximately 89% over our closing stock price of $3.71 on October 11, 2022. Mr.
MacMillan responded that the proposal to proceed at a price of $7.00 per share was insufficient and the
proposal did not provide us with the level of certainty and specificity that was necessary. Mr. MacMillan
noted that, at the October 4, 2022 Board Meeting, the Board was not supportive of $7.50 per share without
greater certainty and specificity.
On October 13, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated
that Thoma Bravo would be willing to proceed at a price of $7.25 per share, which represented a premium of
approximately 94% over our closing stock price of $3.74 on October 12, 2022, subject to further due diligence
regarding our financial outlook. Mr. MacMillan responded that he did not anticipate the Board would
support a transaction at a price of $7.25 per share, especially in view of the continued lack of certainty and
specificity as to terms and due diligence requirements, but that, nevertheless, he would communicate the
proposal to the Board. Later that day, Mr. MacMillan communicated this proposal to the Board.
On October 16, 2022, we sent a letter to Thoma Bravo requesting that Thoma Bravo and its advisors
return to us, or destroy, all confidential information that had been provided to them pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement.
On October 20, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. MacMillan and verbally indicated
that Thoma Bravo would be willing to proceed at a price of $7.50 per share and that it had generally
completed their due diligence on us (other than confirmatory legal due diligence), to which Mr. MacMillan
responded that Thoma Bravo should put the offer in writing and provide along with any proposed
36 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
significant changes to the draft Merger Agreement so that the Board could fully evaluate the terms being
proposed and the certainty of the Proposed Transaction.
On October 20, 2022, Thoma Bravo and UserZoom submitted a further revised non-binding indication of
interest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $7.50 per share (the “October 20
Proposal”), representing a premium of approximately 112% over our closing stock price of $3.54 on October
20, 2022, and a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. Among other terms reflected in the draft Merger
Agreement, the Merger Agreement (i) included a “go-shop” period of 45 days, which was unchanged from
the initial draft Merger Agreement that Fenwick & West sent to Kirkland & Ellis, (ii) rejected our proposal
that Thoma Bravo pay us a reverse termination fee if the Proposed Transaction cannot close because of a
failure to obtain necessary antitrust approvals or clearances, (iii) proposed that we pay Thoma Bravo a
termination fee of 2.7% of the equity under certain circumstances (0.9% with respect to a proposal made
during the “go-shop” period), which was unchanged from the initial draft Merger Agreement that Fenwick &
West sent to Kirkland & Ellis and (iv) rejected our proposal that a portion of the unvested stock options and
RSUs held by employees be accelerated in the event that they were terminated without cause, or for “good
reason.”
Later on October 20, 2022, our management contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss the
October 20 Proposal and next steps, and determined to engage in further discussions with Thoma Bravo to
confirm that Thoma Bravo was firm on price and that Thoma Bravo did not require additional due diligence
that could be expected to affect their valuation, and determined that upon such confirmation from Thoma
Bravo, we would review the October 20 Proposal with the Board.
On October 21, 2022, at the direction of our management, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed
the Proposed Transaction with representatives of Thoma Bravo, including Thoma Bravo’s plan to commit
equity capital to fund the entire cash consideration payable at closing under the Merger Agreement and that
Thoma Bravo would potentially seek debt financing for a portion of the purchase price following the signing
of the Merger Agreement. During such discussion and at the direction of our management, representatives
of Morgan Stanley also noted that we had updated the September Financial Forecast to reflect our third
quarter financial performance, and estimates for the fourth quarter. In addition, representatives of Morgan
Stanley mentioned that the Board would review the October 20 Proposal after Thoma Bravo confirmed it was
now firm on price and that no additional diligence items were needed for Thoma Bravo to complete its
valuation diligence. Representatives of Thoma Bravo replied that they needed to see our revenue and billing
results for the third quarter along with current revenue and billings estimates for the fourth quarter, and a
current fully-diluted share calculation.
Later on October 21, 2022, at the direction of our management, representatives of Fenwick & West sent a
revised draft of the Merger Agreement, and an initial draft of our related disclosure letter to representatives
of Kirkland & Ellis.
On October 22, 2022, we provided representatives of Thoma Bravo with our revenue and billing results
for the third quarter along with current revenue and billings estimates for the fourth quarter and a current
fully-diluted share calculation and, after reviewing this information, Thoma Bravo confirmed to
representatives of Morgan Stanley the $7.50 per share price included in the October 20 Proposal and that no
additional due diligence that could be expected to affect their valuation remained outstanding.
Later on October 22, 2022, representatives of Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis discussed the
revised draft of the Merger Agreement, and between October 23, 2022 and October 26, 2022, representatives
of Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and our
disclosure letter and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the draft Merger Agreement. Among
other items in the draft Merger Agreement, the parties negotiated exceptions to the interim operating
covenants regarding actions that we could take following the execution of the Merger Agreement.
Later on October 22, 2022, Morgan Stanley provided us with an updated customary disclosure
document describing certain relationships between Morgan Stanley and representatives thereof on the one
hand and UserTesting and Thoma Bravo, and their respective affiliates, on the other hand, which reiterated
the relationships identified in the disclosure document previously provided to us. We provided a copy of
this disclosure document to the Board on October 23, 2022.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 23, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of
Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, Mr. MacMillan and representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed the October 20 Proposal and the status of the Proposed Transaction, including
that Thoma Bravo had confirmed the price included in the October 20 Proposal and that no additional
valuation diligence remained outstanding. Mr. Pexton then presented the updated long-term financial
forecast that was developed by our management over the course of October, a copy of which had been
provided to the Board for review prior to the meeting, for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through
2025 with certain extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026
through 2036 with the guidance of our management (the “October Financial Forecast”) that reflected the
potential impact of our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022 on future periods, and
which reflected reduced levels of revenue, gross margin, EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow as compared
to the September Financial Forecast as a result of our revenue and billing results for the third quarter and
estimates for the fourth quarter and trends in our end markets that we observed subsequent to our
preparation of the September 21 forecast. The October Financial Forecast is described in more detail in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “- Management Projections”. A representative of Fenwick & West
then described the status of negotiations of the Merger Agreement. The Board then discussed the October
20 Proposal in light of the October Financial Forecast and these trends in our end markets, and the risks to
our business of current increased economic and market uncertainty, and directed our senior management to
continue to work with Thoma Bravo to complete negotiations on the basis of the October 20 Proposal.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley left the meeting. The Board and a representative of Fenwick & West then
discussed the updated relationship disclosure that had been provided by Morgan Stanley, and the Board
determined to re-engage Morgan Stanley and we subsequently executed an addendum to the engagement
letter with Morgan Stanley on October 24, 2022 to reinstate the terms of such engagement letter. The Board
then approved the use of the October Financial Forecast by Morgan Stanley in its financial analyses of the
Proposed Transaction.
Later on October 23, 2022, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis sent to representatives of Fenwick & West
initial drafts of each of the Equity Commitment Letters and Guaranties to be entered into by the Thoma Bravo
Funds and by the Sunstone Partners Funds concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement. From
October 24, 2022 through October 26, 2022, representatives from Fenwick & West and Kirkland & Ellis
negotiated the Equity Commitment Letters and Guaranties.
On October 25, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Ms. Sabet and representatives of
Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. At the meeting, Mr. MacMillan, Ms. Sabet and Morgan
Stanley provided an update on the discussions with Thoma Bravo and Fenwick & West then led a
discussion regarding material terms of the Merger Agreement and certain open issues, including the
restrictions on the operation of our business following execution of the Merger Agreement.
On October 26, 2022, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and representatives of Fenwick & West
completed their negotiation of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letters and Guaranties.
On October 26, 2022, the Board held a meeting at which Mr. Pexton, Mses. Sabet and Huff and
representatives of Fenwick & West and Morgan Stanley were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley
delivered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated October 26, 2022, to the effect that, as of October 26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope
of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share consideration of
$7.50 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of our common stock (other than holders of the
Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders
of shares of our common stock. Morgan Stanley’s opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “- Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.” Representatives of Fenwick & West
reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties and summarized the key terms of the transaction, including the
outcome of the negotiations with respect to the “go-shop” provision and the restrictions on the operation of
our business following execution of the Merger Agreement. Following discussion and consideration of the
Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the factors
described in the section titled “- Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board”), the members of
the Board unanimously (i) determined that it was in the best interests of us and our

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with UserTesting’s
management and legal and financial advisors and the Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of UserTesting and our stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii)
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for the consideration of our stockholders at the Special
Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (2)
“FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
The Board carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with our
management and legal and financial advisors and the Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the
best interests of us and our stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii)
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) recommended that our stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for the consideration of our stockholders at a special
meeting of our stockholders.
In reaching these decisions, the Board considered the following positive reasons to support the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby:
the fact that the price of $7.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate
value and liquidity to our stockholders;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of our common
stock, including the fact that $7.50 per share to be received by our stockholders in the Merger
constituted a premium of:
approximately 94% over the closing price of our common stock as of October 26, 2022, the last
trading day before the public announcement of the Merger; and
approximately 96% over the average price of our common stock for the 30 trading days ended
October 26, 2022;
the current and prospective business environment in which we operate, including international,
national and local economic conditions, the competitive environment, and the likely effect of these
factors on us and the execution of our plans as a standalone company, including the risks of current
increased economic and market uncertainty;
the Board’s belief that the $7.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to our
stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives
reasonably available to us, based upon the directors’ extensive knowledge of our business, assets,
financial condition and results of operations, the execution challenges that we potentially face, our
historical and projected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger
represented an attractive and comparatively certain value for our stockholders relative to the risk-
adjusted prospects for us on a standalone basis;
the fact that the consideration to be paid in the Merger is payable solely in cash, which allows our
stockholders to realize immediate liquidity and certainty of value in respect of their shares of common
stock, while eliminating the effect on our stockholders of long-term business and execution risk;
the results of our outreach, with the assistance of Morgan Stanley, to the strategic parties and
financial sponsors that the Board believed would be most likely to be interested in evaluating a
potential transaction and able to provide an attractive valuation;
the potential negative risk to the business in the event that discussions regarding a potential
acquisition should become publicly known;
our right, pursuant to a go-shop period ending 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on December 10, 2022, to solicit
Alternative Acquisition Proposals from, and participate in discussions and negotiations with, third
parties regarding Alternative Acquisition Proposals;
the belief that, after multiple rounds of negotiations with Thoma Bravo and its representatives (as
described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Background of the
Merger”), $7.50 per share was the highest price that Thoma Bravo was willing to pay as of the date of
execution of the Merger Agreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most
favorable terms to us, in the aggregate, to which Thoma Bravo was willing to agree;
the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as
of October 26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley as set forth therein, the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by holders of shares of our
common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of shares of our common stock, as more fully
described below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Opinion of Morgan Stanley &
Co. LLC,” which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety;
the fact that we have sufficient operating flexibility to conduct our business in the ordinary course
prior to the consummation of the Merger;
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are limited in number and scope,
and which, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of our representations and warranties,
is generally subject to a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Representations and
Warranties”) qualification;

the ability of the Board to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in
certain circumstances, to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal upon
payment of a termination fee of $33,880,000 (which the Board believed was reasonable under the
circumstances) and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal received prior to
11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on December 20, 2022 to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal received from certain parties upon payment of a reduced termination fee equal to
$10,160,000;
the End Date of April 26, 2023 (subject to extension under certain circumstances), which is expected
to allow for sufficient time to complete the Merger;
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to our stockholders who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the
DGCL;
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement, the obligations of Parent under the
Merger Agreement to arrange and consummate the financing, and the limited number and nature of
the conditions in the Financing Letters;
our ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment
Letter, to specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter;
the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain
circumstances, Parent will pay us a termination fee of $67,760,000, and the obligations of the Thoma
Bravo Funds and the Sunstone Partners Funds under the Guaranties to fund such amount;
representations by Parent in the Merger Agreement that it will have adequate resources to pay the
merger consideration and other amounts required to consummate the Merger, taking into account the
proceeds from the Financing Letters and our projected cash balance;
our rights to specific performance under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement; and
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, in light of the experience, reputation and
financial capabilities of Thoma Bravo and its equity financing sources.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered, among other things, the following negative
factors:
the fact that we would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company and our
stockholders would not benefit from any future growth potential or benefit from any future increase
in our value as a private company;
the possibility that the Merger will not be consummated and the potential negative effects on our
business, operations, financial results and stock price;
the potential negative effects of the public announcement of the Merger on our sales, operating
results and stock price, its ability to retain key management, sales, engineering and other personnel,
and its relationships with customers, suppliers and partners;
the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, requiring us to
conduct our business in the ordinary course and preventing us from taking certain specified actions,
subject to specific limitations and exceptions, all of which may delay or prevent us from undertaking
business opportunities pending completion of the Merger;
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing
the Merger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the
substantial time and effort of our management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt
our business operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
the conditions to the obligations of Parent to complete the Merger and the right of Parent to terminate
the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;

the fact that the Merger Agreement precludes us from actively soliciting Alternative Acquisition
Proposals after the Go-Shop Period, and the possibility that we may be obligated to pay Parent a
termination fee of $33,880,000, or $10,160,000 in the event that we terminate the Merger Agreement
under certain circumstances;
if Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of the failure to obtain the financing under the Debt
Commitment Letter or a breach of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, remedies are
generally limited to the Parent termination fee payable by Parent as described above, which may be
inadequate to compensate us for the damage caused, and if available, other rights and remedies may
be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain;
the fact that completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances, including under
applicable antitrust laws, and the fact that even if obtained, these clearances may delay the
completion of the Merger;
the possible loss of our key management or other personnel during the pendency of the Merger;
the risk of litigation;
the fact that the consideration consists of cash and will therefore be taxable to our stockholders who
are subject to taxation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
the interests that certain of our directors and executive officers may have with respect to the Merger,
in addition to their interests as our stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of UserTesting in the
Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement is not
meant to be exhaustive but addresses the material information and factors considered by the Board in
consideration of their respective recommendations. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the
Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not
find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching their respective determinations and recommendations. Rather, in considering the
information and factors described above, individual members of the Board each applied his or her own
personal business judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors. The
Board based their respective unanimous recommendations on the totality of the information presented. The
explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be
read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”",47,50

UserTesting retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial
opinion in connection with the possible sale of UserTesting. The Board of Directors selected Morgan
Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its
extensive expertise and experience advising software companies in connection with potential strategic
transactions (including but not limited to numerous transactions with Thoma Bravo), and its knowledge of
UserTesting’s business and affairs based on its longstanding relationship with UserTesting, including as a
result of acting as UserTesting’s lead underwriter in its initial public offering in November 2021. At the
meeting of the Board of Directors on October 26, 2022, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of October 26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope
of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the $7.50 per share in cash to be
received by holders of shares of UserTesting common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of
UserTesting common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the opinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion. You are encouraged to read Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion
was directed to the Board of Directors, in its capacity as such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of
view of the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of UserTesting common stock (other than
the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not
address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other
alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not,
constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how UserTesting stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.
The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information
of UserTesting;
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
UserTesting;
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of UserTesting and certain
extrapolations prepared with guidance from the management of UserTesting (which were reviewed
and approved by the Board of Directors for Morgan Stanley’s use);
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of UserTesting
with senior executives of UserTesting;
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for UserTesting common stock;
compared the financial performance of UserTesting and the prices and trading activity of UserTesting
common stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with UserTesting, and
their securities;
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of UserTesting, Parent
and their legal advisors;
reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of October 26, 2022, drafts of each of the Equity
Commitment Letters and the Guaranties, in each case substantially in the form of the drafts dated
October 26, 2022, and certain related documents; and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors
as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made
available to Morgan Stanley by UserTesting, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to
the October Financial Forecast, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of UserTesting’s management of the future
financial performance of UserTesting. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such financial projections or
the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,
amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other things, that Parent will obtain
financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters, and that the definitive
merger agreement and Equity Commitment Letters would not differ in any material respect from the drafts
thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the
necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no
delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on
the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax
or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of UserTesting and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect
43 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not
such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to
the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of UserTesting’s officers, directors or
employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders
of shares of UserTesting common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the Merger.
Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
UserTesting, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, October 26, 2022. Events occurring after October 26,
2022 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did
not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with its oral opinion as of October 26, 2022, subsequently confirmed in writing as of such date, to the Board
of Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the
financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor
does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses.
Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any
portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley
utilized and was directed by the Board of Directors to rely upon, among other matters, (i) the October
Financial Forecast, which included extrapolations through calendar year 2036 prepared by Morgan Stanley
that were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by the Board of Directors, and (ii) certain
estimates of equity research analysts available as of October 26, 2022, which included extrapolations through
calendar year 2025 prepared by Morgan Stanley (the “Street Consensus”). The October Financial Forecast
are more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Projections.” In
accordance with direction from the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley utilized the Street Consensus and the
October Financial Forecast in its financial analyses described below.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied
value of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed
and compared certain financial estimates for UserTesting with comparable publicly available consensus
equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment
and experience, that share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating
characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market
capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred
to as the “comparable companies”). These comparable companies are identified below.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated
revenue for each of the comparable companies utilizing publicly available financial information from
consensus equity analyst research estimates for calendar year 2023 (which ratio is referred to herein as
“AV/CY2023E Revenue Multiple”). For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value”
as a company’s fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
The range of observed AV/CY2023E Revenue Multiples for the selected customer experience comparable
companies was 2.7x to 6.0x, with a median observed multiple of 4.8x, and for the selected software financial
44 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
comparable companies was 1.3x to 4.8x, with a median observed multiple of 2.5x. The following is a list of the
selected comparable companies reviewed, together with the applicable multiples:

Based on an analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the
application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of
AV/CY2023E Revenue Multiples of 2.0x - 4.0x and applied this range of multiples to the estimated revenue for
UserTesting for calendar year 2023 based on the Street Consensus. In addition, for the purpose of this
analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated UserTesting’s aggregate value assuming UserTesting’s net cash as of
September 30, 2022 as provided by UserTesting’s management. Based on the calculations set forth above
and the outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by
UserTesting management on October 25, 2022, this analysis implied an estimated value per share of
UserTesting common stock of $3.80 to $6.46.
No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to UserTesting. In
evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond UserTesting’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of
competition on UserTesting’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of UserTesting and the industry, and in the
financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in
itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight
into a theoretical estimate of the potential future equity value of a company as a function of such company’s
estimated future revenue. The resulting estimated future equity value is subsequently discounted back to
the present day to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the implied present value for the company’s common
stock. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values
per share of UserTesting common stock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Consensus and October
Financial Forecast.
To calculate the discounted equity value per share of UserTesting common stock, Morgan Stanley used
calendar year 2025 estimated revenue of approximately $335 million based on the Street Consensus and
approximately $348 million based on the October Financial Forecast. For each scenario, Morgan Stanley
calculated the future-implied aggregate value of UserTesting as of December 31, 2024 by applying its public
trading comparables analysis reference range for AV/CY2023E Revenue Multiples of 2.0x - 4.0x to
UserTesting’s calendar year 2025 estimated revenue based on each of the Street Consensus and the October
45 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Financial Forecast. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future-implied aggregate value by
estimated future diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates provided by UserTesting’s management) to
calculate a future implied equity value per share. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting future
implied equity values per share to December 31, 2022 using a discount rate equal to UserTesting’s assumed
cost of equity of 13.5 percent, which cost of equity was selected based on the application of Morgan
Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. Based on these calculations, this analysis implied the
following value ranges per share of UserTesting’s common stock:
Forecast Scenario
Implied Value Per Share
Range of 
UserTesting Common 
Stock ($)
Street Consensus
3.84 - 7.15
October Financial Forecast
4.08 - 7.51
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied
value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of
such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for UserTesting
common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value UserTesting as a standalone entity.
Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the October Financial Forecast for purposes of its discounted cash
flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (burdened by stock based compensation), less
taxes and capital expenditures, and adjusted for changes in net working capital (excluding deferred revenue)
and deferred revenue. To calculate terminal value, Morgan Stanley applied a range of perpetual growth rates
of 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent, based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment. Morgan Stanley then
discounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to present values as of December 31, 2022 using
a range of discount rates from 12.5% to 14.5%, which discount rates were selected based on the application
of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of UserTesting’s weighted
average cost of capital. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted to add net cash and further
adjusted to add the net present value of net operating losses.
Based on the outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by
UserTesting’s management on October 25, 2022, this analysis implied an estimated value per share of
UserTesting common stock of $3.59 to $5.17.
Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a
value of a company based on publicly available financial terms, by reviewing publicly available statistics for
selected comparable transactions. Such comparable transactions included certain software transactions
since 2018 that were selected because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, as determined
based on the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. For each such
transaction, Morgan Stanley noted the aggregate value of the transaction as a multiple of the estimated
revenue of the target company for the twelve month period following the announcement date of the
applicable transaction (which multiple is referred to herein as “AV/NTM Revenue Multiple”).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on its analysis of the AV/NTM Revenue Multiples for each of the transactions listed above and
upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected a representative
multiple range of 4.5x to 7.5x and applied this range to UserTesting’s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue
based on each of the Street Consensus and the October Financial Forecast. The results of this analysis were
as follows:
Forecast Scenario

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to UserTesting or
the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond UserTesting’s control. These include, among other things, the
impact of competition on UserTesting’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of UserTesting and the
industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies
and the aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared.
The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of UserTesting derived from the valuation
of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the
holders of shares of UserTesting common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) is not
necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the Merger,
but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial
analysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors.
Illustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums
Morgan Stanley reviewed the premiums paid by acquirers in selected public software company
transactions occurring in 2022 with an aggregate value greater than $1 billion. For each such transaction,
Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (i) the implied
premium to the acquired company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the
last full trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related
news); and (ii) the implied premium to the acquired company’s 30-day average closing share price prior to
announcement (or the last full trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or
similar merger-related news).
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its
professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected (i) a representative range of premia and
applied such range to UserTesting’s closing share price on October 26, 2022 and (ii) a representative range of
premia and applied such range to UserTesting’s closing share price during the 30 trading days prior to and
including October 26, 2022.

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed certain future public market trading price targets for UserTesting common
stock prepared and published by equity research analysts prior to October 26, 2022. These targets reflected
each analyst’s estimate of the future public market trading price of UserTesting common stock. The range of
undiscounted analyst price targets for the UserTesting common stock was $4.50 to $9.00 per share, with a
median of $8.00 per share. Morgan Stanley then discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for
the UserTesting common stock to December 31, 2022 at a rate of 13.5%, which was the discount rate selected
by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect
UserTesting’s cost of equity. This analysis indicated an implied range of fully diluted equity values for
UserTesting common stock of $4.06 to $8.12 per share.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect
current market trading prices for UserTesting common stock, and these estimates are subject to
uncertainties, including the future financial performance of UserTesting and future financial market
conditions.
Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis.
Morgan Stanley reviewed a hypothetical leveraged buyout analysis to determine the prices at which a
financial sponsor might effect a leveraged buyout of UserTesting. Morgan Stanley based its analysis on the
October Financial Forecast. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley assumed (i)
a transaction date of December 31, 2022 and an investment period ending December 31, 2027, (ii) a target
range of annualized internal rates of return for the financial sponsor of 20% to 22.5%, (iii) a 21.4% debt-to-
capitalization ratio, and balance sheet cash at December 31, 2022 of $165 million as provided by
UserTesting’s management as of September 30, 2022, (iv) a range from 3.0x to 4.0x applied to the estimated
calendar year 2027 next twelve (12) month revenue exit multiples and (v) no synergies. Based on these
calculations, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity value per share of UserTesting common stock
of $5.43 to $7.47 per share.
General
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a
variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole
and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes
that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have
given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan
Stanley’s view of the actual value of UserTesting. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market
and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond UserTesting’s control. These include,
among other things, the impact of competition on UserTesting’s business and the industry generally,
industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of
UserTesting and
49 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses
are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness
from a financial point of view of the $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of
UserTesting common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of October 26, 2022 to the Board of
Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of
UserTesting common stock might actually trade.
The $7.50 per share in cash to be received by the holders of shares of UserTesting common stock (other
than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm’s-
length negotiations between UserTesting and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors. Morgan
Stanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however,
recommend any specific consideration to UserTesting or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley
opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative
business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are
available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a
recommendation as to how UserTesting stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken
into consideration by the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the
analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors
with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether the Board of Directors
would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a
committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan
Stanley’s customary practice.
The Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications,
experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,
investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in
securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives
trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services.
Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage
funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and
effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or
loans of UserTesting, Parent, Thoma Bravo and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any
currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition,
Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with UserTesting in
connection with the Merger, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity
funds managed by Thoma Bravo or its affiliates and their affiliated funds’ respective portfolio companies
(which are referred to collectively herein as the “Thoma Bravo Related Entities”) or in affiliates of Morgan
Stanley that may hold direct equity and/or partnership interests in private equity funds managed by Thoma
Bravo or the Thoma Bravo Related Entities.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided UserTesting financial advisory
services and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in
connection with the Merger, and UserTesting has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $20.4
million for its services, $3 million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this
section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger. UserTesting has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses,
including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its
engagement. In addition, UserTesting has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan
Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in
connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Summary of Projections
Except for financial outlooks with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection
with our ordinary course earnings announcements, we do not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose
forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent
unpredictability of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer term
periods. In connection with the evaluation of the Merger, however, our management prepared the following
preliminary financial forecasts:
the October Financial Forecast, which was prepared by our management in October 2022 for the fiscal
years ending December 31, 2022 through 2025 and included certain extrapolations prepared by
Morgan Stanley for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through 2036 with the guidance of our
management; and
the September Financial Forecast, which was prepared by our management in September 2022 for the
fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through 2025.
The October Financial Forecast and September Financial Forecast are referred to collectively as the
“Management Projections”.
The October Financial Forecast was provided to the Board in connection with its consideration of the
Merger, and, at the direction of the Board, was used by Morgan Stanley in connection with its financial
analysis for purposes of its fairness opinion (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “- Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”). The September 2022 Projections, together
with our billings and revenue results for the third quarter of 2022 of approximately $46.4 million and $49.4
million, respectively, and our billings and revenue estimates for the fourth quarter of 2022 of approximately
$54.3 million and $50.6 million, respectively, were provided to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with their
due diligence review of our company.

Important Information Regarding the Management Projections
The Management Projections were developed by our management on a standalone basis without giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the
Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that
context. Although the Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on
numerous variables and assumptions made by our management with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as
matters specific to our business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of
which are beyond our control. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are
subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, our performance, industry
performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, competition, adverse
changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete
acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in our reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that
the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower
than the Management Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information
by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will
be affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The
Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and
cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be
relied on as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that
we, Morgan Stanley, our and their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives
or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of
future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management
Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Management Projections
will be necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by us or any other person
regarding the Management Projections or our ultimate performance compared to such information. The
Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements
and other information about us contained in our public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.” In light of the
foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, our stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.
The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view
toward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or the guidelines established by the American Institute of

In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that UserTesting stockholders vote to
adopt the Merger Agreement, our stockholders should be aware that certain of our non-employee directors
and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of
UserTesting stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests,
among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, approving the Merger Agreement
and the Merger, and recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by our stockholders.

Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits
described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
The Effective Time is October 31, 2022, which is the assumed date of the Closing of the Merger solely
for purposes of the disclosure in this section (the “Change in Control Date”);
The employment of each of our executive officers will have been terminated by us without “cause” or
due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason”  (as such terms are defined in each of
their Change in Control and Severance Agreements), in either case, immediately following the Change
in Control Date; and
The potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback”
to avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
For purposes of this disclosure, (1) UserTesting’s executive officers are: (i) Andy MacMillan, our
President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson; (ii) Jon Pexton, our Chief Financial Officer; (iii) Mona
Sabet, our Chief Corporate Strategy Officer; (iv) Kaj van de Loo, our Chief Technology Officer; (v) Michelle
Huff, our Chief Marketing Officer; (vi) David Satterwhite, our Chief Revenue Officer; and (vii) Matthew
Zelen, our Chief Operating Officer, and (2) UserTesting’s named executive officers are: (i) Andy MacMillan;
(ii) Jon Pexton; and (iii) David Satterwhite.
As the amounts provided below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate as of the date referenced, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or
become payable may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
Treatment and Quantification of Company Equity Awards
Company Options
At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option by (y) the total
number of shares of UserTesting common stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to
applicable withholding taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common
stock of such Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such
Vested Company Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration over (ii) the per-share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the
total number of shares of UserTesting common stock underlying such Unvested Company Option, subject to
applicable withholding taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common
stock of such Unvested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration,
such Unvested Company Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being
made in respect thereof. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company
Option Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company
Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would have vested and
been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company Option Consideration (without
limitation to any rights that the holder may have under any agreement with the Company in effect on the date
of the Merger Agreement).

Company RSUs
At the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of UserTesting
common stock underlying such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to
applicable withholding taxes.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of UserTesting
common stock underlying such Unvested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject
to applicable withholding taxes. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such
Unvested Company RSU Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the
Unvested Company RSU from which such Unvested Company RSU Consideration was converted would
have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company RSU
Consideration (without limitation to any rights that the holder may have under any agreement with the
Company in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement).
Quantification of Company Equity Awards
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU (whether vested or unvested) held by a non-employee
member of the Board of Directors is considered a Vested Company RSU and will convert into Merger
Consideration in the manner described above. Based on the assumptions described above under the section
of this proxy statement captioned “- Interests of Our Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger - Certain
Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable to UserTesting’s six (6) non-
employee directors in respect of their Vested Company RSUs is $645,337.50, which excludes any grants of
Company RSUs that may be made by UserTesting to the non-employee directors following the date of this
proxy statement.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company Option held by the
executive officers will convert into cash awards of Unvested Company RSU Consideration and Unvested
Company Option Consideration in the manner described above and will generally remain subject to the same
vesting conditions and other terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Each award of Unvested Company RSU Consideration and Unvested Company Option Consideration will
vest in the event that an executive officer experiences a termination of employment by UserTesting without
• 
vest in the event that an executive officer experiences a termination of employment by UserTesting without
“cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason,” in either case, within three (3) months prior to the
Change in Control Date or within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control Date.
Change in Control and Severance Agreements
Prior to the initiation of discussions and negotiations regarding the Merger Agreement, we entered into
individual Change in Control and Severance Agreements (the “Severance Agreements”) with each of our
executive officers (other than with respect to our Chief Product Officer, who commenced employment shortly
prior to the signing of the Merger Agreement, and entered into our standard form of Severance Agreement in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with our prior practice for our executive officers), under
which each of our executive officers is eligible to receive certain severance payments and benefits upon a
qualifying termination of employment. The Severance Agreements generally provide that if the executive
officer’s employment is terminated by us without “cause” or the executive officer terminates his or her
employment with “good reason,” in either case, within three (3) months prior to the Change in Control Date
or within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control Date, then the executive officer will be eligible
to receive:
a lump-sum cash severance amount equal to 100% of the executive officer’s annual base salary;
55 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
an additional cash payment equal to a pro-rated portion of his or her annual target bonus (or the full
target bonus in the case of our Chief Executive Officer);
to the extent that the applicable executive officer elects continued coverage under COBRA, he or she
will also receive a further cash payment in an amount equal to his or her COBRA premiums for twelve
(12) months plus an additional amount designed to account for the fact that such payment is made on
an after-tax basis; and
accelerated vesting of 100% of the unvested shares subject to all outstanding equity compensation
awards held by the executive officer immediately prior to such termination of employment, with
performance-based equity awards vesting based on actual achievement or, if not yet determined, then
at 100% of target achievement.
The provision of payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer’s
execution of a release of claims. The Severance Agreement further provides that if an executive officer
receives any amount that is subject to the “golden parachute” excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 280G
and 4999 of the Code, the amount of the payments to be made to the executive officer will be reduced to the
extent such reduction would result in a greater amount of after-tax proceeds.
Vesting Acceleration
At the Effective Time, the Unvested Company Options pursuant to the stock option agreement granted
on June 4, 2020, by and between UserTesting and Mr. MacMillan will fully vest and accelerate and will be
considered Vested Company Options.
Equity Grants to Non-Employee Directors
We may grant and issue up to 22,667 Company RSUs (in addition to any Permitted Equity Grants
granted and issued) to our non-employee directors, on terms consistent with UserTesting’s Independent
Director Compensation Policy, in the event the Closing has not occurred on or prior to June 1, 2023.
Compensation Arrangements with Parent
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers have discussed or entered into
any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or
participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the Closing of the
Merger, however, some or all of our executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or
any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent
or one or more of its affiliates.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, our directors and executive officers will be entitled to
certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time under
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and
insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Indemnification and Insurance.”
Post-Closing Management of UserTesting and UserZoom
In addition, upon completion of the Merger, it is anticipated that our Chief Executive Officer and,
potentially, other members of our management team, will serve as members of the management team of the
Surviving Corporation. Following the closing of the transaction, Thoma Bravo and Sunstone Partners intend
to combine UserTesting and UserZoom. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers
has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to
purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to and
following the closing of the Merger, however, certain of our executive officers may have discussions, and
following the closing of the Merger, may enter into agreements with, Parent or Merger

We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions
will be approximately $1.3 billion, which will be funded via equity and, potentially, debt financing described
below together with our cash on hand as of the Closing Date.
Parent and Merger Sub have represented to us that, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, the equity financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters, if
funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters, will, together with cash on hand, or other sources
of immediately available funds, provide Parent with sufficient funds to pay the fees and expenses required to
be paid at the Closing of the Merger by Parent and Merger Sub and Parent’s other affiliates on the Closing
Date. This includes funds needed to: (1) pay our stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement
for their UserTesting common stock, (2) make payments in respect of our outstanding Company Options and
Company RSUs payable at the Closing of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement; and (3) repayment
or refinancing of certain indebtedness.
Parent and Merger Sub have obtained committed financing consisting of equity to be provided by the
Thoma Bravo Funds and the Sunstone Partners Funds pursuant to the terms of their respective Equity
Commitment Letters. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to us
copies of the Equity Commitment Letters. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters or any debt financing) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates
or any other financing transaction be a condition precedent to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger
Sub under the Merger Agreement.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters, the Thoma Bravo Funds and the Sunstone Partners Funds
have each committed to contribute or cause to be contributed to Parent at the Closing of the Merger certain
equity financing for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts. We refer to the equity financing
described in the preceding sentence as the “Equity Financing.” The obligations of the Thoma Bravo Funds
and the Sunstone Partners Funds to provide the Equity Financing under the Equity Commitment Letters are
subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to: (i) the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement, (ii) the satisfaction or written waiver (to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement) by
the parties, as applicable, of each the conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (other than any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the prior or substantially concurrent satisfaction of such conditions), and the
substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement
and (iii) no material amendment or modification of the Merger Agreement, unless Parent has consented in
writing to such amendment or modification.
The obligation of each of the Thoma Bravo Funds and the Sunstone Partners Funds to fund the equity
commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the consummation
of the Closing and the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable at the Closing in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms, and (iii) the occurrence of any event which, by the terms of the Guaranties, is an event which
terminates the guarantors’ obligations or liabilities under their respective Guaranties.
We are an intended and express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with
respect to the right to cause Parent to enforce, and to enforce against the other investors party thereto, the
commitment under the Equity Commitment Letters to be funded to Parent in accordance with the applicable
Equity Commitment Letter, in each case subject to (i) the limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letters and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

If the Merger is consummated, UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners who continuously hold
or own shares of UserTesting common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw
their demands or otherwise lose their rights of appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in
connection with the Merger under Section 262 the DGCL (“Section 262”). The following discussion is not a
complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by
the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by
reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a
recommendation that record holders or beneficial owners of UserTesting common stock exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262.
Any person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions
of Section 262, which is attached hereto as Annex C, particularly the procedural steps required to properly
demand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding and
perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 and in this
summary to a (i) “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of UserTesting common stock unless
otherwise expressly noted herein, (ii) “beneficial owner” are to a person who is the beneficial owner of
shares of UserTesting common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person,
and (iii) “person” are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners who: (i)
properly submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares; (ii) do not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) hold or own such shares upon the making of a demand
under clause (i) and continue to hold or own their shares through the Effective Time; (iv) do not thereafter
withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, each in
accordance with the DGCL; and (v) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262, may be
entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
the “fair value” of the shares of UserTesting common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined
to be “fair value,” if any, as determined by the court. A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand
in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares in accordance with the procedures of subsection (d)
(1) of Section 262 summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares
through the Effective Time and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the
first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner
reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by
documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which
such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 and
to be set forth on the Verified List (defined below). The shares of UserTesting common stock are currently
listed on a national securities exchange, and, assuming such shares remain listed on a national securities
exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has
been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who have
asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock eligible for appraisal as measured in accordance with
subsection (g) of Section 262; or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration provided for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership
thresholds”).
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest on an appraisal award from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the
judgment will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal
Reserve”)

discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
Effective Time and the date the judgment is paid. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of
Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to
each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case
interest will accrue after the time of such payment as provided herein only on the sum of (i) the difference, if
any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that
time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such
entry of judgment. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their
shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the
value of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if
they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which
appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section
262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262
may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes UserTesting’s notice to our
stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262
is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any person who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so, should review Annex C
carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may
result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will
be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover,
because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, we believe that if a
person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel.
UserTesting stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of
their shares of UserTesting common stock must do ALL of the following:
the person must not vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement;
the person must deliver to us a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the proposal
to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
the person must continuously hold the shares upon the making of the demand through the Effective
Time (a person will lose appraisal rights if the person transfers the shares before the Effective Time);
and
the person or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
requesting a determination of the “fair value” of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has
no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank,
broker or other nominee regarding methods of voting.
Filing Written Demand
Any UserTesting stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us,
before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted for stockholder approval, a written demand for the appraisal
of such person’s shares, and that person must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement. A person exercising appraisal rights must hold the shares for which they will seek
60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal upon the making of the demand for appraisal and must continue to hold the shares through the
Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely
revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and will therefore constitute a waiver of
the person’s right of appraisal and nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a
person who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must ensure that the proxy
submitted contains instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or to abstain from
voting. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal
satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder’s or beneficial
owner’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Record Holders
A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of UserTesting common stock by a holder of record must be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder
and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the
Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares
are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand
must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for
two (2) or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however,
the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the
agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of record, such as a brokerage firm, bank,
trust or other nominee, who holds shares of UserTesting common stock as nominee or intermediary for one
or more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of UserTesting common stock
held for one (1) or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In
that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of UserTesting common stock as to which
appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of UserTesting common stock is expressly mentioned, the
demand will be presumed to cover all shares of UserTesting common stock held in the name of the holder of
record.
Beneficial Owners
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial
owner’s shares in accordance with the procedures of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 summarized above,
provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time and
otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of
Section 262, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of
the shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial
owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct
copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive
notices given by the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 and to be set forth on the Verified List
(defined below). Although not expressly required by Section 262, we reserve the right to take the position
that we may require the submission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3)
of Section 262 with respect to any person sharing beneficial ownership of the shares for which such demand
is submitted.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

person who withdraws such person’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with
respect to a UserTesting stockholder or beneficial owner, such stockholder or beneficial owner will be
entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could
be less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
notify each UserTesting stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and any beneficial
owner who has demanded appraisal under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262, of the effective date of the
Merger.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section
262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant shares) may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving
Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a UserTesting stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding a
determination of the “fair value” of the shares held by all such persons. The Surviving Corporation is under
no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and no person should assume that the
Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the “fair value” of the
shares of UserTesting common stock. Accordingly, any UserTesting stockholders or beneficial owners who
desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in
respect of their shares of UserTesting common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section
262. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of UserTesting common stock to file such a petition
within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify such person’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has complied with the
requirements of Section 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written
request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which we have received
demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning
such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the
record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for
purposes of such aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting
UserTesting stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written
request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands
for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting common stock held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition
seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the Surviving Corporation and a copy
thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within
twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the
“Verified List”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their
62 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of
any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the persons shown on the Verified
List at the addresses stated therein. The form of the notice by mail shall be approved by the Delaware Court
of Chancery, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
After notice to the persons shown on the Verified List as required by the court, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons who have complied
with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require persons who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock
represented by certificates (if any) to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any person fails to comply with the
direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. In addition,
assuming the UserTesting common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to
all persons who have asserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of “Fair Value”
After determining persons entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds
described above has been satisfied as to the persons seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will
be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the “fair value” of the shares of UserTesting common stock, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the “fair value.” In determining “fair value,” the Delaware Court of Chancery
will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will compound
quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established
from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date the judgment is paid. However, at
any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving
Corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will
accrue after the time of such payment only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest
accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at that time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining “fair value” in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Supreme Court of Delaware stated that, in making
this determination of “fair value,” the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the
Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that “fair
value” is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a
“narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme
Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as so
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Per Share
Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner
63 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
address, “fair value” under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of “fair value”
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons seeking appraisal should recognize that such an
appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Neither UserTesting nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Merger
Consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights, and each of UserTesting and Parent reserves the
rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of UserTesting common
stock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a demand for appraisal is duly withdrawn, if a
petition for appraisal is not timely filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been
satisfied as to persons seeking appraisal rights (assuming the UserTesting common stock remained listed on
a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), or other requirements
imposed by Section 262 to perfect and seek appraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will
cease.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to
the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the
Verified List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with
interest, if any, by the Surviving Corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each
such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware
Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses
of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose
name appears on the Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection
therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata
against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section
262 or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under subsection (k) of Section 262.
In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of UserTesting common stock under
Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, the
stockholder’s shares of UserTesting common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. A person will fail to
perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed
within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds
described above has been satisfied as to persons seeking appraisal rights (assuming the UserTesting
common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger) or if the person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person’s demand
for appraisal in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or
all of such person’s shares will be entitled to vote such shares of UserTesting common stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the Effective Time. If no petition
for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to
persons seeking appraisal rights (assuming the UserTesting common stock remained listed on a national
securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), or if the person delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such
person’s shares within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, then the right of such person to an appraisal
of the shares subject to the withdrawal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware
Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any person without the
approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just,
including without limitation a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the court made under
subsection (j) of

Section 262; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any person who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a

exercise those rights.",67,73

Two lawsuits have been filed in federal courts against UserTesting and its directors: O’Dell v.
UserTesting, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-10071 (S.D.N.Y.), and Glanville v. UserTesting, Inc., et al., 3:22-cv-07568
(N.D. Cal.) (collectively, the “Stockholder Litigation”). The complaints name UserTesting and our directors as
defendants. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14a-19 promulgated thereunder, and generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement misrepresents
and/or omits certain purportedly material information relating to the Merger, including allegations relating to
the background of the Merger, financial projections, analyses of our financial advisor and conflicts of
interest by company insiders in pursuing the Merger. The complaints seek a variety of equitable and
injunctive relief including, among other things, an injunction enjoining the consummation of the Merger,
rescission of the Merger Agreement, rescission of the Merger if it is consummated, rescissory damages and
costs and attorneys’ fees. We have not yet responded to the complaints filed in the Stockholder Litigation.
In addition, three purported stockholders of UserTesting sent demand letters regarding the preliminary
proxy statement (the “Demand Letters”). Based on the same core allegations as the Stockholder Litigation,
the Demand Letters request that we disseminate corrective disclosures in an amendment or supplement to
the preliminary proxy statement.
We believe the Stockholder Litigation and the Demand Letters are without merit, but there can be no
assurance that we will ultimately prevail in the Stockholder Litigation or all such lawsuits. Additionally,
additional lawsuits may be filed and demand letters may be sent before the Special Meeting and/or the
consummation of the Merger.",73,73

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
that may be relevant to our stockholders whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant
to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,
rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all
as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change, which may or may not be retroactive,
could alter the tax consequences to our stockholders as described herein. This discussion is limited to
holders who hold their shares of UserTesting common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). For purposes of this
discussion, a “holder” means either a U.S. Holder (as defined below) or a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below)
or both, as the context may require.
This discussion does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of
their particular facts and circumstances, nor does it address any consequences to holders subject to special
rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:

holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of UserTesting
common stock (by vote or value) at any point during the five-year period prior to the Merger; and
holders that received their shares of UserTesting common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options or otherwise as compensation.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax consequences other than those pertaining to the
income tax (such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income
or non-income tax consequences, or the consequences of the Medicare tax on net investment income. If a
partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
is a beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Partnerships holding shares of UserTesting common stock and partners therein should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular circumstances.
No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Merger described herein. This summary is not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no
assurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that
they would be sustained by a court if so challenged.
HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES
AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting
common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control
of one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that
66 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States
person as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of UserTesting common stock pursuant to
the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of UserTesting common stock surrendered pursuant to the
Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the
shares of UserTesting common stock. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of
the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain will generally apply to long-term capital gain of a non-
corporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of UserTesting
common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger will generally not be subject to U.S.
federal income tax unless:
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case
such gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to a United
States person as defined under the Code, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may
also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
tax treaty); or
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-
three (183) days or more in the taxable year of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are
met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate
under an applicable tax treaty).
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds
received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder
that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to
backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that provides
a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a
substitute or successor form) or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be
allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability; provided that the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

General
We and Parent have agreed to take all action necessary to comply with all regulatory notification
requirements, and, subject to certain limitations, to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include
approval under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws (whether domestic or foreign).
67 TABLE OF CONTENTS
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until
UserTesting and Thoma Bravo each files a Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the
DOJ and the FTC, and the applicable 30-calendar-day waiting period has expired or been terminated. If the
FTC or DOJ issues a request for additional information and documents (which we refer to as a “Second
Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day
waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the
Second Request, unless earlier terminated or extended by court order.
We and Thoma Bravo each filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger with the FTC and DOJ on November 9, 2022.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration
of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC, the DOJ or any state attorneys general could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to
enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or seeking to
require the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual
rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will
prevail.
Other Regulatory Approvals
The Merger is also subject to certain regulatory actions by the CMA and ACCC. The relevant regulatory
bodies could take action under applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent the completion of the Merger or
permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action
under regulatory laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger
on regulatory grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

UserTesting common stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to applicable withholding
taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common stock of such Vested
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Vested Company
Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (ii)
the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of
UserTesting common stock underlying such Unvested Company Option, subject to applicable withholding
taxes, provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of UserTesting common stock of such Unvested
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Unvested Company
Option will be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration
amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option from which such
Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to
its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company Option Consideration (without limitation to any rights that
the holder may have under any agreement with the Company in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement).

compliance with the terms of, or the taking or omission of any action expressly required by, the
Merger Agreement or consented to or requested by Parent or any of its representatives (except with

relating to our conduct during pendency of the Merger);
any act of civil unrest, civil disobedience, war, terrorism, cyberterrorism, military activity, sabotage or

The Go-Shop Period - Solicitation of Other Offers

Acquisition Proposal (as defined in this section of this proxy statement below), including by providing
information (including non-public information and data) relating to UserTesting and any of our subsidiaries
and affording access to the businesses, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information,
or to any personnel, of UserTesting and our subsidiaries to any third person (and its representatives,
including potential financing sources of the third person) that has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that we must provide Parent and Merger Sub (and their representatives, including
financing sources) with access to any information or data that is provided to any third person given such

person (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereof) and (ii) continue, enter into, engage in or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third person (and their respective
representatives, including potential financing sources of the third person) regarding any Alternative
Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, offers or proposals or any other effort or attempt that could reasonably

facilitate in any way, any such inquiries, offers, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or
attempt to make any Alternative Acquisition Proposals or other proposals that could reasonably be expected
to lead to Alternative Acquisition Proposals, including by granting a waiver, amendment or release under any
pre-existing “standstill” or other similar provision to the extent necessary to allow for an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal or amendment to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal to be made confidentially to us
or to the Board of Directors. We must also notify Parent within twenty-four (24) hours of entering into any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
If we terminate the Merger Agreement prior to 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on December 20, 2022 to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal received from an Excluded Party, then we would be
required to pay a termination fee of $10,160,000 to Parent. For more information, please see the section of this

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an agreement with us that is either (i) in effect as of the
date the Merger Agreement was entered into, or (ii) executed, delivered and effective after the date the
Merger Agreement was entered into, in either case containing provisions that require any counterparty

with respect to UserTesting and/or our subsidiaries to keep such information confidential; provided,
however, that,

with respect to such agreements executed and delivered following the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement, the provisions contained therein relating to the confidential treatment of information and the use
thereof are not materially less restrictive in the aggregate to such counterparty (and any of its affiliates and
representatives named therein) than the terms of the non-disclosure letter agreement entered into between us
and Thoma Bravo (it being understood that such agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar
provisions or otherwise prohibit the making of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal) and that such
agreement does not contain provisions which prohibit us from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with the Merger Agreement.
“Alternative Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal or indication of interest by a third person
relating to or concerning (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, tender offer, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving us, in each case, as a
result of which our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction would cease to own at least 75% of
the total voting power of UserTesting or the surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent company
thereof), as applicable, immediately following such transaction, (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any
third person of assets constituting or accounting for more than 25% of the consolidated assets, revenue or
net income of UserTesting and our subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (including equity interests in any
subsidiaries), or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any third person of more than 25% of the
outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock or securities representing more than 25% of the total
voting power of UserTesting.
“Excluded Party” means any third person (i) from whom we received a written Alternative Acquisition
Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and (ii) whose Alternative Acquisition Proposal the Board of
Directors determines in good faith prior to the start of the No-Shop Period Start Date, after consultation with
its outside financial advisors and legal counsel, either to be a Superior Proposal or an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; provided, however,
that a third person will immediately cease to be an Excluded Party (and the provisions of the Merger
Agreement applicable to Excluded Parties will cease to apply with respect to such third person) if (1) the
Alternative Acquisition Proposal is withdrawn by the third person or (2) the Alternative Acquisition
Proposal, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and legal counsel, no longer is or could no longer be reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal.
“Superior Proposal” means a written Alternative Acquisition Proposal substituting in the definition
thereof “80%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears, that (i) was not solicited in
violation of the non-solicitation obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (ii) the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with UserTesting’s outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of Directors considers to be appropriate (including (a)
all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal (including certainty of closing) and the identity of
the third person making the Alternative Acquisition Proposal and (b) any revisions to the Merger Agreement
made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination in accordance with the change
of recommendation provisions of the Merger Agreement), to be more favorable to us and our stockholders
than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Acquisition Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement.
In addition, we have agreed to (i) cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any third person and its representatives, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public
information concerning us and our subsidiaries furnished to any person with whom a confidentiality
agreement with respect to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal was entered into at any time during the period

information with respect to us or any Alternative Acquisition Proposal to any such third person or its

physical or electronic data room (or any other diligence access) containing any such information.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, we may continue to engage in the activities delineated in the
previous two paragraphs with respect to any Excluded Party (but only for so long as such person is and
remains an Excluded Party), including with respect to any amended or modified Alternative Acquisition
Proposal received from any Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date.
Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by our stockholders, if we receive an Alternative Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was
not received in response to, or as a result of, any material breach of our non-solicitation obligations pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, (i) we and our representatives may contact the third party making such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, and (ii) if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions in
respect of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, then we may: (A) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its
representatives and potential equity and debt financing sources) with respect to such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, and (B) furnish non-public information to the third party making such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal (and its representatives and potential equity and debt financing sources) if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the third party has executed an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with us;
provided that we provide to Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective representatives) any information or
data that is provided to such third party that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such third party (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours thereof). We will notify Parent that we have entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution thereof.
Both during the Go-Shop Period and after the No-Shop Period Start Date but prior to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by our stockholders, we are not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the
purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal unless we comply with certain
procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over
a four (4)-business-day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and/or the Equity Commitment Letters, so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a “Superior
Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such
negotiations.
As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period, we shall deliver to Parent a written notice setting forth: (i) the identity of

with our disclosure obligations under applicable law or rules and policies of the NYSE, as determined in good
faith by us, including taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
our stockholders) or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of our position
thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to our stockholders if the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with UserTesting’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to
make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; provided that (1) any such statement or disclosure must be subject to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of UserTesting
or the Board of Directors and the rights of Parent under the applicable section of the Merger Agreement, and
(2) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit us or the Board of Directors to effect a Change of
Recommendation other than in accordance with the applicable section of the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by
our stockholders, the Board of Directors may effect a Change of Recommendation if (i) we have received a
Superior Proposal or (ii) there has been an Intervening Event (as defined below), in each case, that the Board
of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The Board of Directors may only effect a Change of Recommendation or authorize us to terminate the
Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal substantially concurrently
with the termination of the Merger Agreement if:
the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
we have provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business days in advance of our
intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in response to
such Superior Proposal, which shall include a description of the terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal, the identity of the person or entity making the Superior Proposal and a copy of any
proposed definitive agreement(s) relating to such Superior Proposal, including any related financing
commitments, if any;
we have complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal;
we have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its representatives (to the extent Parent notifies
UserTesting in writing that it desires to negotiate) with respect to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement and/or the Equity Commitment Letters so that such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
following such four (4)-business-day period, the Board of Directors (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to

irrevocable by Parent and Merger Sub until the expiration of the foregoing four (4)-business-day

expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, we will honor all UserTesting
employee plans in accordance with their terms. Parent acknowledges that a “change in control”  (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will occur at
the Effective Time.
For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (A) the first (1st) anniversary
of the Effective Time and (B) the date of termination of the Company Employee (as defined below) (such
82 TABLE OF CONTENTS
earlier period, the “Continuation Period”), Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates to
provide to each current employee of UserTesting and our subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remains
so employed immediately after the Effective Time (“Company Employees”) (i) base compensation and target
annual or short-term cash incentive opportunities (including target short-term commission-based cash
incentive opportunities) that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-
based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that were provided to the
Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time, provided, however, that nothing set forth in the
Merger Agreement will require Parent to provide compensation in the form of equity or equity-based
compensation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide to each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the Continuation Period under
circumstances that would give rise to cash severance pay or benefits under the existing terms of the United
States Company Benefit Plans set forth in the confidential disclosure letter and designated as a severance
plan, policy or practice, and any Company Benefit Plan outside of the United States (the “Company
Severance Plans”), cash severance pay equal to the cash severance pay provided under the Company
Severance Plans. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, the terms and
conditions of employment of any Company Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are subject
to a collective bargaining agreement will be governed by such applicable collective bargaining agreement.
For all purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the corresponding
employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after
the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee will be credited with his or her years of
service with UserTesting and our subsidiaries and our and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time. However, the
foregoing will not apply with respect to any defined benefit pension benefits or to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to and replaces a Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, and vision insurance benefits to any Company Employee, Parent will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived or satisfied under the comparable plans of UserTesting or our subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent will cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan
to the extent such amounts were credited to such person for the same purpose under the Old Plan.
With respect to each of our annual cash incentive plans set forth in the confidential disclosure letter or
entered into following the date of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement (each, a “Company Incentive Plan”), the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) pay to each Company Employee who
remains employed with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries (i) in the case of
fiscal year 2022, through the end of fiscal year 2022, at the same time or times that we or any of our
subsidiaries has historically paid such annual bonuses in respect of the prior fiscal year, but in no event later
than March 15 immediately after the end of fiscal year 2022, a bonus for such fiscal year (the “Annual
Bonus”) that is equal to the Annual Bonus that such Company Employee would have been entitled to
receive under the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Incentive Plan for such fiscal year based
on actual levels of performance, solely to the extent such Company Employee has not been previously paid

providing for (and later consummated) such Alternative Acquisition Proposal.
We will be entitled to receive a termination fee of $67,760,000 from Parent (the “Parent Termination Fee”)

Parent, Merger Sub and UserTesting agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of the Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Parent, Merger Sub and UserTesting acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger
Agreement: (i) the non-breaching party will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, including monetary damages), to obtain (A) a decree or order of specific
91 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (B) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach and (ii) the fees and expenses provisions of the
Merger Agreement are not intended to and would not adequately compensate UserTesting, on the one hand,
or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of the Merger
Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither UserTesting nor Parent would have entered into
the Merger Agreement.
It is explicitly agreed that, subject to the limitations of the next two sentences, we will have the right to
specific performance in connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the
Merger and cause the financing to be funded (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the
Thoma Bravo Funds and the Sunstone Partners Funds under the Equity Commitment Letters in order to
cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters) subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein
and in the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that our right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund a portion
of the amount required to consummate the Merger and to make all payments required to be made in
connection therewith (but not our right to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable
remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all of the (x) joint conditions to
Parent’s, Merger Sub’s and UserTesting’s obligations to consummate the Merger and (y) conditions to
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger, in each case, have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), (ii) we have irrevocably confirmed in writing
that if the Equity Financing is funded, then we shall take such actions that are required of us by the Merger
Agreement to arrange and consummate the Closing of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub will have failed to consummate the Merger by the time Closing
was to occur under the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the
parties to the definitive agreements for any financing under the terms thereof, we are not entitled to directly
seek the remedy of specific performance of the Merger Agreement against any debt financing source.
Additionally, the election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief will not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit us from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement and
collect the Parent Termination Fee; provided that in no event will we be permitted to pursue an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief or any other remedy under the Merger Agreement or available
at law or equity following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement.
Parent, Merger Sub and UserTesting agree not to raise any objections to (i) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of the Merger Agreement by us, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand;
and (ii) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent
and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if
necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If UserTesting stockholders approve the adjournment
proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use
the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from our stockholders that have
previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among
other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their
votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the
Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairperson of the Special
Meeting.
Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation
Approval of the adjournment proposal if a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of UserTesting common stock entitled to vote
that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and are voted for or against the
matter. Assuming a quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will
have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal, (ii) abstentions will have no effect on the
outcome of the adjournment proposal and (iii) broker “non-votes”  (if any) will have no effect on the outcome
of the adjournment proposal. Shares of UserTesting common stock represented by properly executed, timely
received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a
UserTesting stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy
card, the shares of UserTesting common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be
voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.

than 10% of UserTesting’s common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in
ownership with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish UserTesting with copies of

to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed to act as a paying agent
hereunder and approved in advance by the Company in writing (the “Paying Agent”), for the benefit of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable at the Closing pursuant to Section 1.4. Such cash deposited with the
Paying Agent shall be referred to as the “Payment Fund.”
(ii) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Payment
Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be
limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government; provided, further, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to this Section 2.3, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(iii).
(iii) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of
any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation on demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock who
have not surrendered their shares in accordance with this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (as general unsecured creditors) for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon, on due surrender of their shares.
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4(b), (A) a letter of transmittal with respect to
Book-Entry Shares (to the extent applicable) and Certificates (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only on delivery of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually reasonably agree), and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares (to the extent applicable) or Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
(ii) On surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an “agent’s
message” by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall be required to
promptly deliver to each such holder, the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.3. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable on due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established that
such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid.

instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.3.

party hereto may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other parties hereto under this Section 7.2 as “outside counsel only.” Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient party, and
the recipient party shall cause such outside counsel not to disclose such materials or information to any
employees, officers, directors or other Representatives of the recipient party or its Affiliates, unless express

contrary, materials provided pursuant to this Section 7.2 may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with
respect thereto, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (A) agrees
not to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone or videoconference, with

Governmental Entity from participating or attending any such meeting or discussion, agrees to keep such

proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall

any Action, decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is

foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).

shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and furnish all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required in connection with the preparation of the Proxy

filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any dissemination thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such document or
response, and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments proposed by Parent. The Company
shall respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the
receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Proxy Statement shall comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent (solely with
respect to the Parent Information or other information relating to Parent or its Affiliates, officers or directors)
or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the
Proxy Statement would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party or Parties
hereto (as the case may be) and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days) after the resolution of any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement (which resolution will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively
notified the Company prior to the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy
Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, the “Clearance Date”); provided
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if the Clearance Date occurs prior to the end
of the Go-Shop Period, the Company will not be required to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company until the expiration of the Go-Shop Period but shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days) after the expiration of the Go-
Shop Period.
(b) Subject to the terms of Section 7.3(d), the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance
with applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company to set a record date for,
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Stockholder
Meeting”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date and, subject to the terms of
Section 7.3(c), in any event no later than forty-five (45) days following the Clearance Date. Once established,
the Company shall not change the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as
otherwise required by applicable Law (including any requirement of Law in connection with any
rescheduling, postponement or adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting that is permitted
hereunder). Unless the Company shall have made a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section
7.3(d), the Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit,
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholder Meeting (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement).
(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement
to its stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) to allow
time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed
and disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Company Stockholder Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct

postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times or for more than 45 calendar

reasonably determines in good faith that the Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained (it
being understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more
than two times or for more than 45 calendar days in total pursuant to this clause (iii) without Parent’s prior
written consent) or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders
in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(a) Change in Control. Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control”  (or similar phrase) within
the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.
(b) Company Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all
Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms (it being understood that nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation, Parent or its Affiliates from amending, modifying,
replacing or terminating such arrangements in accordance with their terms).
(c) Post-Closing Protection Period. For the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the
earlier of (A) the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time and (B) the date of termination of the Company
Employee (such earlier period, the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates to provide to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
who remains so employed immediately after the Effective Time (“Company Employees”) (i) base compensation
and target annual or short-term cash incentive opportunities (including target short-term commission-based
cash incentive opportunities) that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-
based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that were provided to the
Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this
Section 7.6 will require Parent to provide compensation in the form of equity or equity-based compensation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to
each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the Continuation Period under circumstances
that would give rise to cash severance pay or benefits under the existing terms of the United States
Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 7.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules and designated
thereon as a severance plan, policy or practice, and any Company Benefit Plan outside of the United States
(the “Company Severance Plans”), cash severance pay equal to the cash severance pay provided under the
Company Severance Plans. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.6 to the contrary, the terms and
conditions of employment of any Company Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are subject
to a Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall be governed by such applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement.
(d) Service Crediting. For all purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the
corresponding employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Company Employee was entitled, before
the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to any defined benefit pension benefits or to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to and replaces a Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, and vision insurance benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived or satisfied under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan
to the extent such amounts were credited to such person for the same purpose under the Old Plan.

(c) Acknowledgements. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are
an integral part of this Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(a), Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(b), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, respectively, all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including attorneys’ fees as well as
expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated seeking such payment), together with interest on
the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime
lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be
made. The Parties further acknowledge that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination
Fee shall constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties further
acknowledge that the right to receive the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, shall not limit or otherwise affect any such Party’s right to specific performance as provided in
Section 9.5; provided that in no event shall either Party be entitled to receive both specific performance and
payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable.

Parent’s rights to specific performance expressly set forth in Section 9.5, in any circumstance in which this
Agreement is terminated and Parent is paid the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.3, the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant to

assignees or successors or any former, current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, controlling
Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative, agent, assignee or successor
of any of the foregoing (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss or damage suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated

monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches (including any willful and material breach) under

respect thereto), the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(ii) and

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each
Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, (i) the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (A) a
decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation and (B) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, and (ii) the provisions of
Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will
not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded under the Equity Commitment Letter and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the
Merger if, but only if, (A) all of the conditions in Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b) have been, and continue to
be, satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied at the Closing)) at the time the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to Section 2.1, (B) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur in
accordance with Section 2.1 and (D) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate the Merger by
the time the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1. In no event shall the Company
be entitled to enforce specifically Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or exercise
its third party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letter) if the Debt Financing has not been
funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or other
equitable remedies against any Debt Financing Source. The election to pursue an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the
alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.3(b); provided that in no event shall the Company be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific

specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger
Sub pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain,
