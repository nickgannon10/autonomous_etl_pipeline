ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND THE SPECIAL MEETING,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE BUSINESS COMBINATION
AND THE SPECIAL MEETING
The questions and answers below highlight only selected information set forth elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and only briefly address
some commonly asked questions about the special meeting and the proposals to be presented at the special meeting, including with respect to the
proposed Business Combination. The following questions and answers do not include all the information that may be important to Alkuri
Stockholders. Stockholders are urged to carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the other documents
referred to herein, to fully understand the proposed Business Combination and the voting procedures for the special meeting.
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
A: Alkuri and Babylon Holdings have agreed to a business combination under the terms of the Merger Agreement that is described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and Alkuri encourages its
stockholders to read it in its entirety. Alkuri Stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement,
which, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving corporation in the Business
Combination and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Babylon, and the other Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. See “Proposal
One—The Business Combination Proposal.”
Q: Are there any other matters being presented to stockholders at the meeting?
A: In addition to voting on the Business Combination Proposal, the stockholders of Alkuri will vote on the following proposals:
•
to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the 2021 Plan, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.
See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “Proposal Two—The Equity Plan Proposal.”
•
to consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, if the parties are not able to
consummate the Business Combination for any reason. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “Proposal Three—The
Adjournment Proposal.”
Alkuri will hold the special meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote upon these proposals. This proxy statement/prospectus contains important
information about the proposed Business Combination and the other matters to be acted upon at the special meeting. Stockholders should read it
carefully.
The vote of stockholders is important. Regardless of how many shares you own, you are encouraged to vote as soon as possible after carefully
reviewing this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q: Why is Alkuri providing stockholders with the opportunity to vote on the Business Combination?
A: Because the structure of the Transactions involves a merger of Alkuri itself, Alkuri stockholders must be afforded an opportunity to vote on the
Business Combination under Delaware law. Therefore, a stockholder meeting will be held under Delaware law to vote on the Business Combination. In
addition, pursuant to the SPAC Charter, Alkuri is required to provide stockholders with an opportunity to have their shares of Alkuri Common Stock
redeemed for cash, either through a stockholder meeting or tender offer. Due to the structure of the Transactions, Alkuri is providing this opportunity
through a stockholder vote. In addition, the Alkuri Stockholders are being asked to vote upon the Equity Plan Proposal.
viiTable of Contents
Q: I am an Alkuri Warrant holder. Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
A: The Alkuri Warrants will become exercisable following the Business Combination and will entitle holders to purchase Babylon Class A Shares, with the
number of shares and the exercise price adjusted in accordance with the Merger Agreement, as described in more detail herein. This proxy
statement/prospectus includes important information about Babylon and the business of Babylon and its subsidiaries following the Closing of the
Business Combination. Because holders of Alkuri Warrants will be entitled to purchase Babylon Class A Shares after the Closing of the Business
Combination, we urge you to read the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus carefully. Additionally, after the closing of the Business
Combination, Babylon will have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable under certain scenarios. See “Risk
Factors—Babylon may redeem any unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that may be disadvantageous to the holder of such warrants,
thereby making your warrants worthless.”
Q: What will happen to Alkuri’s securities upon consummation of the Business Combination?
A: Alkuri’s units, Alkuri Class A Common Stock and warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbols KURIU, KURI and KURIW, respectively.
If Alkuri’s securities cease trading upon consummation of the Business Combination, each share of Alkuri Common Stock will be automatically converted
into the right to receive one Babylon Class A Share and the Alkuri Common Stock will cease trading. Each outstanding Alkuri Warrant will be assumed by
Babylon and automatically converted into a Babylon Warrant. Alkuri’s units will not be listed on Nasdaq following consummation of the Business
Combination and such units will automatically be separated into their component securities without any action needed to be taken on the part of the
holders of such units. Babylon intends to apply for listing of the Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants on the NYSE under the proposed
symbols “BBLN” and “BBLN.W,” respectively, to be effective upon the consummation of the Business Combination. While trading on the NYSE is
expected to begin on the first business day following the consummation of the Business Combination, there can be no assurance that Babylon’s
securities will be listed on the NYSE or that a viable and active trading market will develop. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Babylon’s Business and
Operations Following the Business Combination” for more information.
Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination?
A: Due to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition
companies and the risk that similar levels of redemptions could occur in connection with the Business Combination, the Business Combination is not
expected to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction, including as a “reorganization” under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that is the
case, holders of Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants will generally be treated as if they sold their Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants in a
taxable transaction and will be taxable on the receipt of the Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants in the Business Combination.
No ruling has been requested, nor is one intended to be requested, from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business
Combination. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination is subject to both legal and factual uncertainty, is not free from doubt,
and may change depending on the actual level of redemptions that occur in connection with the Business Combination. No opinion of counsel has or will
be provided regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination. Consequently, no assurance can be given whether the IRS will
assert, or that a court would sustain, a position contrary to that described above.
For additional information, please read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” The tax consequences to you of the
Business Combination will depend on your particular facts and circumstances. Please consult your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the
Business Combination in your particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other
tax laws.

Q: How will voting rights be allocated among holders of Babylon Class A shares and Babylon Class B Shares?
A: The Babylon Articles provide for a dual class share capital structure, as a result of which holders of Babylon Class B Shares will be entitled to 15 votes
per share, while holders of Babylon Class A Shares will be entitled to one vote per share. This will provide holders of Babylon Class B Shares with
significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and significant corporate transactions,
such as a merger or other sale of Babylon or its assets. Upon the Closing, the Founder will hold all of the issued and outstanding Babylon Class B
Shares, including the Stockholder Earnout Shares. Our Founder may in certain circumstances have sufficient voting control over Babylon to amend
Babylon’s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights attached to Babylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder
terminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control of Babylon following his separation and continue to have the rights
described in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon.
The Alkuri board of directors considered the risk of concentrating voting control in the dual class share structure (with “super-voting” rights for the
Founder), but determined that they were outweighed by the long-term benefits that a founder-controlled company would provide to Alkuri Stockholders
and future shareholders of Babylon after Closing. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ownership of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Operating
as a Public Company—The dual class structure of our ordinary shares has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Founder, which will limit
your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control” for more information.
Q: What equity stake will Alkuri’s public stockholders and the existing Babylon Holdings’ shareholders hold in Babylon immediately after the
consummation of the Business Combination?
A: Immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination, it is anticipated that: (i) Alkuri’s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of
the Babylon Shares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon; (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the
voting power of Babylon; (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor
Earnout Shares) and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon; and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the
Babylon Shares and 95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of
Babylon being held by the Founder). These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will
remain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination, (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with
respect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri’s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing
also excludes shares being purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and
its affiliates in the PIPE Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of
Babylon assuming no redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon assuming maximum
redemptions.
Q: If I am a public unit holder, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my public units?
A: No. Holders of outstanding units must separate the underlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to
the public shares.
If you hold units registered in your own name, in order to redeem your underlying shares you must deliver the certificate for such units to Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, Alkuri’s transfer agent, with written instructions to separate such units into public shares and public warrants. This
must be completed far enough in advance to permit the mailing of the public share certificates back to you so that you may then exercise your redemption
rights with respect to the public shares.
i
x
Table of Contents
If a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee holds your units, you must instruct such nominee to separate your units. Your
nominee must send written instructions by facsimile to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, Alkuri’s transfer agent. Such written instructions
must include the number of units to be split and the nominee holding such units. Your nominee must also initiate electronically, using DTC’s deposit
withdrawal at custodian (DWAC) system, a withdrawal of the relevant units and a deposit of an equal number of public shares and public warrants. This
must be completed far enough in advance to permit your nominee to exercise your redemption rights with respect to the public shares upon the
separation of the public shares from the units. While this is typically done electronically the same business day, you should allow at least one full
business day to accomplish the separation. If you fail to cause your public shares to be separated in a timely manner, you will likely not be able to
exercise your redemption rights.
Q: Why is Alkuri proposing the Business Combination?
A: Alkuri was organized to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or
entities.
On February 9, 2021, Alkuri completed its initial public offering of units, with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-
fourth of one Alkuri Warrant, raising total gross proceeds of approximately $345,000,000 (including $45,000,000 in gross proceeds from the underwriters’
exercise of their over-allotment option in full). Since the Alkuri IPO, Alkuri’s activity has been limited to the evaluation of business combination
candidates.
Alkuri’s management believes Babylon is an exciting company with an appealing market opportunity and growth profile, a strong position in its industry
and a compelling valuation. As a result, Alkuri believes that the Business Combination will provide Alkuri Stockholders with an opportunity to participate
in the ownership of a company with significant growth potential. See the section entitled “Proposal One—The Business Combination Proposal—Alkuri’s
Reasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors.”
Q: What is the “PIPE Investment”?
A: Concurrently with and following the execution of the Merger Agreement, Babylon Holdings entered into Subscription Agreements with certain parties
subscribing for Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to which such PIPE Investors have agreed to purchase, and Babylon Holdings has agreed to sell them,
an aggregate of 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and at an aggregate purchase price of $230 million subject to
certain conditions set forth therein. This PIPE Investment is expected to close immediately prior to the Business Combination.
Q: Did Alkuri’s board of directors obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the Business
Combination?
A: No. Alkuri’s board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business
Combination. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of Alkuri’s board of directors and its advisors in valuing Babylon Holdings
and will be assuming the risk that the Alkuri board may not have properly valued the business. However, Alkuri’s officers and directors have substantial
experience in evaluating the operating and financial merits of companies from a wide range of industries and have substantial experience with mergers and
acquisitions. Furthermore, in analyzing the Business Combination, Alkuri’s officers and advisors conducted significant due diligence on Babylon
Holdings. Alkuri also received advice from the underwriters of the Alkuri IPO, acting in their capacity as financial advisor to Alkuri, as to the valuation of
Babylon Holdings implied by the Transactions and how that valuation compared to peers. In addition, Alkuri also engaged several professional advisors
to assist it in connection with evaluating Babylon Holdings, including Moss Adams LLP (who provided advice on financial, tax and accounting matters)
and Barrington Advisory Group (who provided advice on strategic, process and financial matters). The experience of, and work performed by, Alkuri’s
management team and external advisors, and the commitments
x
Table of Contents
obtained in respect of the PIPE Investment by sophisticated third-party investors at the valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings by Alkuri, provided
additional comfort with respect to the valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings by Alkuri. Accordingly, Alkuri’s board of directors concluded that its
members’ collective experience and backgrounds, together with the experience and sector expertise of Alkuri’s officers and advisors, enabled it to make
the necessary analyses and determinations regarding the Business Combination, including that the Business Combination was fair from a financial
perspective to its stockholders and that Babylon’s fair market value was at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred
underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Business Combination.
There can be no assurance, however, that Alkuri’s board of directors was correct in its assessment of the Business Combination. For a complete
discussion of the factors utilized by Alkuri’s board of directors in approving the Business Combination, see the sections entitled “Proposal One—The
Business Combination Proposal—The Background of the Business Combination” and “Proposal One—The Business Combination Proposal—Alkuri’s
Reasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors.”
Q: Do I have redemption rights?
A: If you are a holder of Alkuri public shares, you have the right to demand that Alkuri redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the cash held in
Alkuri’s trust account, calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. We sometimes refer to these rights
to demand redemption of the Alkuri public shares as “redemption rights.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of Alkuri public shares, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom such holder is acting in
concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more
of Alkuri public shares. Accordingly, all Alkuri public shares in excess of 15% held by a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such holder or
any other person with whom such holder is acting in concert or as a “group,” will not be converted.
Under the SPAC Charter, the Business Combination may not be consummated if Alkuri has net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001 either immediately
prior to or upon consummation of the Business Combination after taking into account the redemption for cash of all Alkuri public shares properly
demanded to be redeemed by holders of Alkuri public shares.
Q: How do I exercise my redemption rights?
A: A holder of public shares may exercise redemption rights regardless of whether it votes for or against the Business Combination Proposal or does not
vote on such proposal at all, or if it is a holder of Alkuri public shares on the record date. If you are a holder of Alkuri public shares and wish to exercise
your redemption rights, you must demand that Alkuri convert your Alkuri public shares into cash and deliver your Alkuri public shares to Alkuri’s
transfer agent physically or electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (“DWAC”) System no later than two
(2) business days prior to the special meeting. Any holder of Alkuri public shares seeking redemption will be entitled to a full pro rata portion of the
amount then in the trust account (which, for illustrative purposes, was $345,022,618, or $10.00 per share, as of the record date), less any owed but unpaid
taxes on the funds in the trust account. Such amount will be paid promptly upon consummation of the Business Combination. There are currently no
owed but unpaid income taxes on the funds in the trust account.
Any request for redemption, once made by a holder of Alkuri public shares, may be withdrawn at any time prior to the time the vote is taken with respect
to the Business Combination Proposal at the special meeting. If you deliver your shares for redemption to Alkuri’s transfer agent and later decide prior to
the special meeting not to elect redemption, you may request that Alkuri’s transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make
such request by contacting Alkuri’s transfer agent at the address listed at the end of this section.
x
i
Table of Contents
Any written demand of redemption rights must be received by Alkuri’s transfer agent at least two (2) business days prior to the vote taken on the
Business Combination Proposal at the special meeting. No demand for redemption will be honored unless the holder’s stock has been delivered (either
physically or electronically) to the transfer agent.
If you are a holder of Alkuri public shares (including through the ownership of Alkuri units) and you exercise your redemption rights, it will not result in
the loss of any Alkuri Warrants that you may hold (including those contained in any units you hold). Your whole warrants will become exercisable to
purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation of the Business Combination.
Q: Do I have appraisal rights if I object to the proposed Business Combination?
A: Under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants will not have
appraisal rights in connection with the Business Combination.
Q: What happens to the funds deposited in the trust account after consummation of the Business Combination?
A: The net proceeds of the Alkuri IPO of $345.0 million, inclusive of the amount raised from the simultaneous private placement of Alkuri Warrants for
$8.9 million, were placed in the trust account immediately following the Alkuri IPO. After consummation of the Business Combination, the funds in the
trust account will be used to pay, on a pro rata basis, holders of Alkuri public shares who exercise redemption rights, to pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Business Combination (including aggregate fees of approximately $12.1 million to the underwriters of the Alkuri IPO as deferred
underwriting commissions). Any proceeds from the trust account which are not required to be used in order to satisfy redemption rights or the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination will be made available to Babylon for use in the conduct of its business (whether for
working capital purposes or otherwise).
Q: What happens if a substantial number of public stockholders vote in favor of the Business Combination Proposal and exercise their redemption
rights?
A: Alkuri’s public stockholders may vote in favor of the Business Combination and still exercise their redemption rights, although they are not required to
vote in any way to exercise such redemption rights. Accordingly, the Business Combination may be consummated even though the funds available from
the trust account and the number of public stockholders are substantially reduced as a result of redemptions by public stockholders.
However, the Business Combination will not be consummated if the levels of redemption give rise to a failure of a condition to closing of the Business
Combination that is not waived. Such conditions to closing may include Alkuri’s obligation to deliver cash proceeds (whether derived from the PIPE
Investment or the trust account) of at least $230 million and the requirement under the SPAC Charter and the Merger Agreement that Alkuri shall not have
less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act) either immediately prior to or upon
consummation of the Transactions.
In the event such conditions to Closing are satisfied or waived, redemptions may result in fewer Alkuri public shares and public stockholders. In such
event, the trading market for Babylon Shares may be less liquid than the market was for Alkuri prior to the consummation of the Transactions, which may
result in adverse consequences such as depressed trading value and Babylon’s inability to meet the listing standards of a national securities exchange. In
addition, to the extent of any redemptions, fewer funds from the trust account would be available to Babylon to be used in its business following the
consummation of the Business Combination.

Q: What happens if the Business Combination is not consummated?
A: If Alkuri does not complete the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings for whatever reason, Alkuri would search for another target business
with which to complete a business combination. If Alkuri does not complete the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings or another business
combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter), Alkuri must
redeem 100% of the outstanding Alkuri public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to an amount then held in the trust account (net of taxes
payable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of outstanding Alkuri public shares. The Sponsor and
Alkuri’s officers and directors have waived their redemption rights with respect to their Sponsor Shares in the event a business combination is not
effected in the required time period, and, accordingly, their Sponsor Shares will be worthless. Additionally, in the event of such liquidation, there will be
no distribution with respect to our outstanding warrants. Accordingly, the Alkuri Warrants will expire worthless.
Q: How do the Sponsor and the officers and directors of Alkuri intend to vote on the proposals?
A: The Sponsor, as well as Alkuri’s officers and directors, beneficially own and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 20% of the outstanding
Alkuri Common Stock. These holders have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the Business Combination Proposal. These holders have also indicated
that they intend to vote their shares in favor of all other proposals being presented at the meeting. In addition to the shares of Alkuri Common Stock held
by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors, Alkuri would need 12,937,501 shares, or approximately 37.5%, of the 34,500,000 Alkuri public shares
sold in the Alkuri IPO to be voted in favor of the Business Combination Proposal and other proposals in order for them to be approved (assuming all
outstanding shares are voted on each proposal).
Q: What interests do the Sponsor and the current officers and directors of Alkuri have in the Business Combination?
A: In considering the recommendation of our board to vote in favor of the Business Combination, stockholders should be aware that, aside from their
interests as stockholders, the Sponsor and certain of our directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that are different from, or in
addition to, those of other stockholders generally. Our directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the
Business Combination, in recommending to stockholders that they approve the Business Combination and in agreeing to vote their shares in favor of the
Business Combination. Stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Business Combination. These interests
include, among other things, the fact that:
•
If the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as
may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming 100% of the
outstanding Alkuri public shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of directors, dissolving
and liquidating. In such event, the Sponsor Shares held by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s directors and officers, which were acquired for an
aggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to participate in any
redemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based upon the closing
price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each
outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
•
The Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private placement warrant. This purchase took place
on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from these
purchases were placed in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of
xiii
Table of Contents
$8,484,666 based upon the closing price of $1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock
underlying the private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on
Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The private placement warrants and Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants
will become worthless if Alkuri does not consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved
by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each
outstanding whole warrant will become a Babylon Warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation of
the Business Combination and each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to
the Merger Agreement.
•
Alkuri’s initial stockholders and owners of private placement warrants paid significantly less for their shares and warrants than other current
stockholders and holders of warrants paid for their shares and warrants purchased in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market thereafter. Prior to
the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or
approximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri’s IPO and the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-
allotment option, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of which entitles the holder
to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per warrant. Each
outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a target value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00. If
the Business Combination is consummated, based on the difference in the purchase price of $0.003 per share that the Sponsor paid for the
Sponsor Shares, as compared to the purchase price of $10.00 per Unit sold in the IPO, these initial stockholders and holders of private
placement warrants will be able, at a lower price per share of Babylon Class A Common Stock, to recognize a greater return on their
investment than stockholders or holders of warrants that purchased Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri warrants in the Alkuri IPO or in the
open market thereafter. Furthermore, the Sponsor may earn a positive rate of return even if the share price of the Babylon Shares after the
Closing falls below the price initially paid for the units in the IPO and the Alkuri Stockholders may experience a negative rate of return
following the Closing of the Business Combination.
•
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, of the 7,187,500 Sponsor Shares that will be converted into 7,187,500 Babylon Class A shares at
Closing, 1,293,750 shares (which we refer to herein as the Sponsor Earnout Shares) will be subject to restrictions if and until milestones
based on the achievement of certain price targets of Babylon Class A following the Closing are met. In the event such milestones are not
met, all of the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Babylon, which Babylon can redeem for
aggregate consideration of $1.00.
•
If Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under certain
circumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims
of vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri
consummates a business combination, on the other hand, Alkuri will be liable for all such claims.
•
The Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them
in connection with certain activities on Alkuri’s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business
combinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have any claim
against the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business Combination
or another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an
amendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their affiliates had incurred
approximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.
xiv
Table of Contents
•
If Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the aggregate dollar amount of non-reimbursable
funds is $98,230,402, comprised of (a) $85,646,250 representing the market value of Sponsor Shares, (b) $8,484,666 representing the market
value of private placement warrants and (c) $4,099,486 of unpaid expenses incurred by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and
their affiliates. Certain Alkuri directors and executive officers have indirect economic interests in the private placement warrants and in the
Sponsor Shares. This includes indirect economic interests in 25,000 Sponsor Shares held by each of Katie May and Stephen Smith and
indirect economic interests in 30,000 Sponsor Shares held by Jason Harinstein. Jason Harinstein, Katie May and Stephen Smith are
independent directors of Alkuri. Envst Opportunities LLC and Works Capital LLC may be deemed to have shared beneficial ownership of
the Sponsor Shares and private placement warrants held directly by the Sponsor. The managing member of Envst Opportunities LLC is
Sultan Almaadeed, Alkuri’s chairman. The manager of Works Capital LLC is Rich Williams, Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer.
•
The Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have agreed
to purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the
other PIPE Investors.
•
Until the first anniversary of Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will
have the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.
•
The Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri’s current directors and officers and the continuation of
directors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri’s current directors and officers.
•
Alkuri’s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the
extent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.
Q: When do you expect the Business Combination to be completed?
A: It is currently anticipated that the Business Combination will be consummated promptly following the Alkuri special meeting, which is set for October
20, 2021; however, such meeting could be adjourned or postponed to a later date, as described above. The Closing of the Transactions is also subject to
the approval of the holders of Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri preferred shares, as well as other customary closing conditions. For a description of the
conditions for the completion of the Business Combination, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the
Transactions.”
Q: What do I need to do now?
A: Alkuri urges you to carefully read and consider the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes, and to consider

A: Your broker, bank or nominee can vote your shares without receiving your instructions on “routine” proposals only. Your broker, bank or nominee
cannot vote your shares with respect to “non-routine” proposals unless you provide instructions on how to vote in accordance with the information and

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?
A: A quorum is the minimum number of shares of Alkuri Common Stock that must be present to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present at the
Alkuri special meeting if a majority of all the outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock entitled to vote at the meeting are represented at the virtual
special meeting or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will count as present for the purposes of establishing a quorum. The Alkuri Class A
Common Stock and Alkuri Class B Common Stock are entitled vote together as a single class on all matters to be considered at the special meeting.
Q: What stockholder vote thresholds are required for the approval of each proposal brought before the special meeting?
•
Business Combination Proposal—The approval of the Business Combination Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock present and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote “against” the Business Combination Proposal. Brokers are not entitled to vote on the Business Combination Proposal
absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder and, consequently, broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “against” the
Business Combination Proposal.
•
Equity Plan Proposal—The approval of the Equity Plan Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock present and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “against” the Equity Plan Proposal. Brokers are entitled to vote on the Equity Plan Proposal absent voting instructions from the
beneficial holder because the proposal is considered “routine.” Consequently, there should be no broker non-votes with respect to the
Equity Plan Proposal.
•
Adjournment Proposal—The approval of the Adjournment Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock present and entitled to
xvii
Table of Contents
vote at the special meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “against” the Adjournment Proposal. Brokers are entitled to
vote on the Adjournment Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder because the proposal is considered “routine.”
Consequently, there should be no broker non-votes with respect to the Adjournment Proposal.
Q: What happens if I fail to take any action with respect to the special meeting?
A: If you fail to take any action with respect to the meeting and the Business Combination is approved by Alkuri Stockholders and consummated, you
will become a shareholder or warrant holder of Babylon.
If you fail to take any action with respect to the special meeting and the Business Combination is not approved, you will continue to be a stockholder
and/or warrant holder of Alkuri, as applicable, and Alkuri will continue to search for another target business with which to complete an initial business
combination. If Alkuri does not complete an initial business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri
Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter), Alkuri must cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeem 100% of the
outstanding Alkuri public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to an amount then held in the trust account (net of taxes payable and less up
to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our
remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate.
Q: What should I do with my share and/or warrant certificates?
A: Warrant holders and those stockholders who do not elect to have their shares of Alkuri Common Stock redeemed for a pro rata share of the trust
account should wait for instructions from Alkuri’s transfer agent regarding what to do with their certificates. Alkuri Stockholders who exercise their
redemption rights must deliver their share certificates to Alkuri’s transfer agent (either physically or electronically) no later than two (2) business days
prior to the special meeting as described above.
Upon consummation of the Transactions, the Alkuri Warrants, by their terms, will entitle holders to purchase shares of Babylon. Therefore,
warrantholders need not deliver their warrants to Alkuri or Babylon at that time.
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A: Alkuri Stockholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and multiple
proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting
instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name,
you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to
cast a vote with respect to all of your shares of Alkuri Common Stock.
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
A: If you have questions about the Business Combination or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy
card, you should contact:

On February 9, 2021, Alkuri closed its initial public offering of 34,500,000 units (after taking into account the full exercise of the over-allotment
option by Alkuri’s underwriters), with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant,

Table of Contents
Structure of the Business Combination
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Alkuri with Alkuri surviving the merger. Upon consummation of the
foregoing, Alkuri will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Babylon (formerly Babylon Holdings).
The following diagrams illustrate in simplified terms the current structure of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings and the expected structure of
Babylon (formerly Babylon Holdings) upon the Closing.
Simplified Post-Business Combination Structure

Table of Contents
Merger Consideration; Reclassification
The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon at $3.515 billion, and prior to
the Closing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby (i) each outstanding Babylon Holdings G1 Share will be reclassified as Babylon
Holdings Class B shares, (ii) each outstanding Babylon Holdings Class B Share and Babylon Holdings Class C Share will be reclassified into
Babylon Class A Shares, and (iii) each outstanding Babylon Holdings Class A Share will be reclassified into Babylon Class B Shares. As a result of
the Reclassification, each outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination
of $10.00 (based on the $3.515 billion equity value of Babylon Holdings). At the Closing, the Babylon Class B Shares will be held by the Founder.
The Babylon Class B Shares will have the same economic terms as the Babylon Class A Shares, but the Babylon Class B Shares will have 15 votes
per share (while each Babylon Class A Share will have one vote per share). See “The Merger Agreement–Reclassification.”
Earnout
In addition, in connection with the Closing, Babylon will issue at the Closing the Stockholder Earnout Shares and the Sponsor Earnout Shares.
The Stockholder Earnout Shares and the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be subject to restrictions linked to milestones (based on the achievement of
certain price targets of Babylon Class A Shares following the Closing) as further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement –
Earnout.” The Sponsor and the Founder will each immediately become the legal and beneficial owner of their respective Earnout Shares at the
Closing, but they will be subject to transfer restrictions and subject to the restrictions based on milestone requirements. While the Earnout Shares
remain outstanding, they shall have all the rights and privileges with respect to Class A Shares for the Sponsor Earnout Shares and Class B Shares
for the Stockholder Earnout Shares (including the right to vote such shares and certain rights to receive on a current basis cash dividends or other
distributions made with respect to such shares). In the event such milestones are not met, all of the Earnout Shares will be automatically converted
into redeemable shares of Babylon which Babylon can redeem for an aggregate consideration of $1.00.
Immediately following the Closing, the Founder will hold 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of the
outstanding ordinary shares of Babylon. As such, we will be eligible to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance
rules of the NYSE. However, we have elected not to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption.
Ownership of Babylon after the Business Combination
It is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri’s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the
Babylon Shares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon; (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the
voting power of Babylon; (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor
Earnout Shares) and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon; and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the
Babylon Shares and 95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of
Babylon being held by the Founder. These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will
remain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination: (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with
respect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri’s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The
foregoing also excludes shares being purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by
the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of
the voting power of Babylon assuming no redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon
assuming maximum redemptions.

The Alkuri Board’s Reasons for the Business Combination
In evaluating the Business Combination, Alkuri’s board of directors consulted with Alkuri’s management and legal and financial advisors.
Alkuri’s board of directors reviewed various industry and financial data in order to determine that the consideration to be paid was reasonable and
that the Business Combination was in the best interests of Alkuri Stockholders. The financial data reviewed included the historical and projected
consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings, comparable publicly traded company analyses and an analysis of pro forma capital structure
and trading multiples prepared by management and Alkuri’s advisors.
Alkuri’s management conducted a due diligence review of Babylon Holdings that included an industry analysis, an analysis of the existing
business model of Babylon Holdings and historical and projected financial results. Alkuri’s management, including its directors and advisors, have
many years of experience in both operational management and investment and financial management and analysis and, in the opinion of Alkuri’s
board of directors, were suitably qualified to conduct the due diligence and other investigations and analyses required in connection with the search
for a business combination partner. A detailed description of the experience of Alkuri’s executive officers and directors is included in the section of
this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Alkuri’s Business—Directors and Executive Officers.”
In reaching its unanimous resolution (i) that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the proposed Business
Combination, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Alkuri and its stockholders and (ii) to recommend that its stockholders adopt and
approve the Merger Agreement and approve the Business Combination contemplated therein, Alkuri’s board of directors considered a range of
factors, including but not limited to, the factors discussed below. In light of the number and wide variety of factors, Alkuri’s board of directors did
not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its
determination. Alkuri’s board of directors viewed its position as being based on all of the information available and the factors presented to and
considered by it. In addition, individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. This explanation of Alkuri’s reasons for the
Business Combination and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the
factors discussed under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
In considering the Business Combination, Alkuri’s board of directors gave considerable weight to the following factors:
•
Visionary Founder and World Class Management Team. Dr. Ali Parsadoust and the Babylon Holdings management team have a deep
understanding of both their direct customers (payer entities) and end users (network participants) and, with over a century of collective
experience in healthcare and technology, have the drive and competency to grow the business and provide healthcare in a manner that
improves the end user’s experience and reduces costs for its customers. Importantly, in a space like healthcare, with large and
entrenched incumbents and relatively high barriers to entry, Alkuri believes it is critical to combine the experience, competency and
drive of a qualified and accomplished management team like Babylon Holdings’ with a proven entrepreneurial leader like Dr. Ali
Parsadoust, who brings a bold vision to drive change in the segment using technology and a customer-focused approach. Dr. Ali
Parsadoust built the first private company to run a U.K. National Health Service (the “NHS”) hospital, Circle Health, which then became
Europe’s largest partnership of clinicians before going public in 2012. Dr. Ali Parsadoust has been named by The Times among the 100
global people to watch, and by the Health Service Journal among the 100 most influential people in U.K. healthcare.
•
Large market opportunity. The $10 trillion global healthcare market, is expected to grow over the coming decades and there is a clear
need for accessibility, quality and affordability. Alkuri also believes that the market is early in its adoption of technology, even in large
economies like the United States. To date, Babylon Holdings has deployed its technology in 16 countries (Malaysia, Indonesia,
5
Table of Contents
Hong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Canada, the United States,
Rwanda and the United Kingdom) and actively provides clinical services in three (the United States, the United Kingdom and Rwanda).
Babylon Holdings is focused on developing its technology and growing its existing market in the United States, which represents an
almost $4 trillion healthcare market opportunity, while also planting roots in new geographical markets.
•
Disruptors. Babylon Holdings is paving the way in the digital transformation of healthcare. By reengineering the healthcare value
change and balancing accessibility, affordability and quality, Babylon Holdings is using its technology platform to connect users to
clinical experts and provide virtual care, in-person medical care and post-care offerings. In Alkuri’s view, Babylon Holdings is unique in
applying a mobile native, digital-first approach at scale to proactive and preventative end-to-end healthcare, which disrupts the
traditional in-person, reactive, “sick care” model that is prevalent in health systems around the world. As evidenced by other market
segments like retail and entertainment, Alkuri believes that digital-first platforms and products that are well-aligned to the changing
needs of its customers can demonstrate more rapid growth, claim significant market share, and deliver the potential for outsized returns
relative to their physical-first peers. As a digital-first disruptor that breaks the mold of a system dominated by clinic- and physical-first
competitors, Alkuri believes Babylon Holdings represents a similar potential opportunity in the healthcare segment, as evidenced in
particular by its accelerated growth in the United States over the past year. For example, the median growth rate for 2019, 2020 and
expected 2021 revenue for three telemedicine companies (Teladoc Health Inc., American Well Corporation and 1Life Healthcare, Inc.
(One Medical)), three integrated care companies (Oak Street Health, Inc., Signify Health Inc. and Accolade, Inc.) (collectively, the
“Selected Peer Companies”) was roughly 40% per year, based on publicly available information, including public filings, while the
Babylon Holdings revenue growth rate for the same period is over 300% per year.
•
Next generation technology. Babylon Holdings’ artificial intelligence (“AI”) architecture and fully integrated technology platform is
designed to help its members navigate their deeply-personal healthcare journeys. Babylon Holdings’ AI has been designed with a
focus on delivering insights and efficiencies to members and clinicians. The AI’s core features include: interpretability and
explainability to provide a layer of transparency over insights and, efficiencies, quantification on uncertainty providing for less
uncertainty and more accurate predictions, data efficiency and flexibility enabling Babylon to adapt to multiple sources of information
and consider latest clinical guidelines, public studies and multiple sources of medical knowledge. In addition, unlike many of its peers
which either focus on bringing patients into their clinics or provide a single solution like fee-based telemedicine consultations, the
broader technology platform is designed to help manage the end-to-end care for a member, and represents what Alkuri believes is the
cutting edge of digital-first healthcare and a multi-year advantage over “technology enabled” industry incumbents and others seeking
to enter the market.
•
Scalable, durable business model. Babylon Holdings’ digital-first model is highly scalable and enables it to deliver fully-integrated,
personalized healthcare across the entire care spectrum through mobile devices the vast majority of individuals in Babylon Holdings’
target markets already own or access. Alkuri expects healthcare spending to continue rising globally as the population in key markets
like the United States continue to age, and Alkuri believes durable secular industry trends toward digital solutions as well as value-
based care will continue to drive adoption of digital healthcare services like those offered by Babylon Holdings. Babylon Holdings has
shown an ability to find market fit and rapidly scale both its software licensing services and value-based care services, yet the 24
million members served by Babylon Holdings represent a small fraction of the total addressable market. Alkuri believes Babylon
Holdings’ technology advantages can enable it to grow revenues on a rate basis faster than its peers, as it has for multiple years, by
expanding the covered population and scope of services in its existing markets and customers, expanding to new markets with new and
existing customers,
6

pursuing strategic partnership and inorganic growth through acquisitions and continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure to
improve capabilities.
•
Consumer and Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) go-to-market characteristics. While in many cases the contracted customers of the
Babylon Holdings service will be a corporate entity like an insurance company, we believe that developing a strong consumer brand
and deep consumer relationships represents a significant opportunity for Babylon Holdings over time. Alkuri believes a unique
characteristic of the Babylon Holdings model is that, unlike most traditional “sick care” systems in healthcare, which generally reward
expensive and episodic emergency care, Babylon Holdings’ business and gross margin can actually improve as more members engage
with the product, provide data to enable preventative care, and avoid costly urgent care, emergency room and hospital visits. Alkuri
expects that building strong direct relationships and brand equity with Babylon Holdings’ consumer members can create both
significant potential bottom-line improvements and retentive capacity for its payer clients and contracts while enhancing Babylon
Holdings’ overall market position and ability to differentiate itself from its competitors. Alkuri’s management’s deep expertise in scaling
consumer brands, business models and products, particularly in mobile, by using digital marketing strategies and technology-enabled
salesforces to help scale businesses may be instrumental in helping Babylon Holdings reach new customers and end users, and to
build a differentiated brand positioning and awareness in a market that we believe is lacking in strong consumer-oriented brands.
•
Organic and inorganic growth potential. Babylon Holdings has experienced robust growth in its early stages yet Alkuri sees
significant addressable market expansion opportunities, with potential expansion in the United States and other new geographies, as
well as potential opportunities for inorganic growth through acquisitions. Notably, the potential for market expansion and inorganic
growth is not contemplated in the current growth projections of Babylon Holdings.
•
Defensible market position. The healthcare industry and, to a lesser extent, the telemedicine and digital self-care industries in which we
operate are highly competitive, however most of Babylon Holdings’ competitors are generally focused on one specific slice of the
healthcare spectrum, single chronic condition or a single mode of service (e.g., telemedicine), or are limited to specific and smaller
geographic ranges due to their reliance on operating owned physical locations, rather than delivering the entire healthcare needs of a
member on a national or even global basis. Babylon Holdings has developed a digital platform and business model that Alkuri believes
will be difficult for other companies in the healthcare and traditional fee-for-service space to emulate.
•
Attractive Valuation. The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon
Holdings at $3.515 billion (or 5.1x projected 2022E revenues of $710 million), which represents a sizeable discount to public trading
market valuations of comparable companies across digital and telehealth industries and digitally enabled healthcare providers. The set
of comparable companies to Babylon Holdings was selected based on the existing universe of publicly traded companies at the time of
the transaction. Additionally, the valuation discount is relative to companies that are growing at lower rates than Babylon Holdings.
Adjusting for Babylon Holdings’ accelerated growth resulted in the valuation range representing an even more sizeable discount to its
peers, which we believe positions the Business Combination as an attractive opportunity for Alkuri Stockholders.
Alkuri’s board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Business
Combination, including, but not limited to, the following:
•
Potential Inability to Complete the Merger. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility that the Business Combination
may not be completed and the potential adverse consequences to Alkuri if the Business Combination is not completed, in particular the
expenditure of time and resources in
7
Table of Contents
pursuit of the Business Combination and the loss of the opportunity to participate in the transaction. They considered the uncertainty
related to factors outside of the control of the parties to the transaction. The Business Combination Agreement also includes an
exclusivity provision that prohibits Alkuri from soliciting other initial business combination proposals, which restricts Alkuri’s ability
to consider other potential initial business combinations until the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the Business Combination.
•
The Risk that Alkuri’s Public Stockholders Would Vote Against the Business Combination Proposal or Exercise Their Redemption
Rights. The Alkuri board of directors considered the risk that some of the current public stockholders would vote against the Business
Combination proposal or decide to exercise their redemption rights, thereby depleting the amount of cash available in the trust account
to an amount below the minimum required to consummate the Business Combination. Further, the fact that public stockholders may
vote for the Business Combination proposal while also exercising their redemption rights mitigates against any incentive a public
stockholder might have to vote against the Business Combination proposal, especially to the extent that they hold public warrants
which would be worthless if the Business Combination is not completed.
•
Babylon Holdings’ Business Risks. The Babylon Holdings board of directors considered that Babylon Stockholders would be subject
to the execution risks associated with Babylon Holdings if they retained their public shares following the Closing, which were different
from the risks related to holding public shares of Alkuri prior to the Closing. In this regard, the Alkuri board of directors considered that
there were risks associated with successful implementation of Babylon Holdings’ long term business plan and strategy and Babylon
Holdings realizing the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination on the timeline expected or at all. The Alkuri board of directors
considered that the failure of any of these activities to be completed successfully may decrease the actual benefits of the Business
Combination and that Alkuri Stockholders may not fully realize these benefits to the extent that they expected to retain the public
shares following the completion of the Business Combination. For additional description of these risks, please see “Risk Factors.”
•
Post-Business Combination Corporate Governance. The Alkuri board of directors considered the corporate governance provisions of
the Merger Agreement and Babylon Holdings’ anticipated organizational documents and the effect of those provisions on the
governance of Babylon Holdings following the Closing. In particular, they considered that, assuming no redemptions by Alkuri
Stockholders, the Founder will individually control shares representing approximately 81.7% of Babylon Holdings’ voting power (taking
account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) upon completion of the Business Combination, will have significant influence over matters
requiring shareholder approval, and have the right to designate a majority of directors to the board of directors of Babylon, as well as
remove directors, for as long as he holds certain amounts of Babylon Shares and will have a right to approve or reject transactions
involving Babylon, including mergers or other sales of Babylon or its assets. Our Founder may in certain circumstances have sufficient
voting control over Babylon to amend Babylon’s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights attached to
Babylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder terminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control
of Babylon following his separation and continue to have the rights described in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon.
The Alkuri board of directors also considered the circumstances under which the “high vote” stock would convert into “low vote”
stock. The Alkuri board of directors was aware that these rights are not generally available to stockholders of Alkuri, including
stockholders that may hold a large number of shares, or directors of Alkuri. See “Agreements Entered Into in Connection with the
Merger Agreement” for detailed discussions of the terms and conditions of these agreements.
•
No Survival of Remedies for Breach of Representations, Warranties or Covenants by Babylon Holdings. The Alkuri board of
directors considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement provide
8
Table of Contents
that neither Alkuri nor its stockholders will have any recourse against Babylon Holdings or its current shareholders after the Closing of
the Business Combination to recover for losses as a result of any inaccuracies or breaches of the Babylon Holdings representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement.
•
Litigation. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility of litigation challenging the Business Combination or that an
adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could enjoin consummation of the Business Combination.
•
Fees and Expenses. The Alkuri board of directors considered the fees and expenses associated with completing the Business
Combination, which it estimated as approximately $68.5 million.
•
Diversion of Management. The Alkuri board of directors considered the potential for diversion of management and employee attention
during the period prior to the completion of the Business Combination, and the potential negative effects on Babylon Holdings’
business.
•
Alkuri’s Management and Directors May Have Different Interests in the Business Combination Than the Public Stockholders. The
Alkuri board of directors also considered the fact that members of Alkuri’s management and board of directors may have interests that
are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of its stockholders generally, including the matters described under “Special
Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders—Interests of Alkuri’s Officers and Directors in the Transactions” below. However, Alkuri’s board of
directors concluded that the potentially disparate interests would be mitigated because (i) these interests were disclosed in the Alkuri
IPO prospectus, and (ii) these disparate interests would exist or may be even greater with respect to a business combination with
another target company.
•
Risks Related to the Dual-Class Share Structure. The Alkuri board of directors also considered the risk of concentrating voting
control in the dual-class share structure (with “super-voting” rights for the Founder), but determined that they were outweighed by the
long-term benefits that a founder-controlled company would provide to Alkuri Stockholders and future shareholders of Babylon after
Closing.
•
Other Risks. Various other risks associated with Babylon Holdings’ business, as described in the section entitled “Risk Factors”
appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Alkuri’s board of directors concluded that the potential benefits that it expected Alkuri and its stockholders to achieve as a result of the
Business Combination outweighed the potentially negative factors associated with the Business Combination. Accordingly, Alkuri’s board of
directors unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination contemplated therein were advisable, fair to and in the
best interests of Alkuri and its stockholders.
Interests of Alkuri’s Officers and Directors in the Transactions
In considering the recommendation of Alkuri’s board of directors to vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri
Stockholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and Alkuri’s directors and executive officers have interests in such proposal that are different
from, or in addition to, those of Alkuri Stockholders generally. In particular:
•
If the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such later date
as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming 100% of
the outstanding Alkuri public shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of directors,
dissolving and liquidating. In such event, the Sponsor Shares held by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s directors and officers, which were
acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the
9
Table of Contents
Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to participate in any redemption or distribution with respect to
such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on
September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock
will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
•
The Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private placement warrant. This purchase took
place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from
these purchases were placed in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $8,484,666 based
upon the closing price of $1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private
placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on
September 7, 2021. The private placement warrants and Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants will
become worthless if Alkuri does not consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved
by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each
outstanding whole warrant will become a Babylon warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation
of the Business Combination and each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
•
Alkuri’s initial stockholders and owners of private placement warrants paid significantly less for their shares and warrants than other
current stockholders and holders of warrants paid for their shares and warrants purchased in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market
thereafter. Prior to the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of
$25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri’s IPO and the full exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of
which entitles the holder to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of
$1.50 per warrant. Each outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a target value at the time of the
Business Combination of $10.00. If the Business Combination is consummated, based on the difference in the purchase price of $0.003
per share that the Sponsor paid for the Sponsor Shares, as compared to the purchase price of $10.00 per Unit sold in the IPO, these
initial stockholders and holders of private placement warrants will be able, at a lower price per share of Babylon Class A Common Stock,
to recognize a greater return on their investment than stockholders or holders of warrants that purchased Alkuri Common Stock or
Alkuri warrants in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market thereafter. Furthermore, the Sponsor may earn a positive rate of return even if
the share price of the Babylon Shares after the Closing falls below the price initially paid for the units in the IPO and the Alkuri
Stockholders may experience a negative rate of return following the Closing of the Business Combination.
•
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, of the 7,187,500 Sponsor Shares that will be converted into 7,187,500 Babylon Class A
shares at Closing, 1,293,750 shares (which we refer to herein as the Sponsor Earnout Shares) will be subject to restrictions if and until
milestones based on the achievement of certain price targets of Babylon Class A following the Closing are met. In the event such
milestones are not met, all of the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Babylon, which
Babylon can redeem for an aggregate consideration of $1.00.
•
If Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under
certain circumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target
businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money
10
Table of Contents
by Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri consummates a business combination, on the
other hand, Alkuri will be liable for all such claims.
•
The Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
them in connection with certain activities on Alkuri’s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and
business combinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have
any claim against the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business
Combination or another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri
Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their
affiliates had incurred approximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.
•
If Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the aggregate dollar amount of non-reimbursable
funds is $ 98,230,402, comprised of (a) $85,646,250 representing the market value of Sponsor Shares, (b) $8,484,666 representing the
market value of private placement warrants and (c) $4,099,486 of unpaid expenses incurred by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and
directors and their affiliates. Certain Alkuri directors and executive officers have indirect economic interests in the private placement
warrants and in the Sponsor Shares. This includes indirect economic interests in 25,000 Sponsor Shares held by each of Katie May and
Stephen Smith and indirect economic interests in 30,000 Sponsor Shares held by Jason Harinstein. Jason Harinstein, Katie May and
Stephen Smith are independent directors of Alkuri. Envst Opportunities LLC and Works Capital LLC may be deemed to have shared
beneficial ownership of the Sponsor Shares and private placement warrants held directly by the Sponsor. The managing member of
Envst Opportunities LLC is Sultan Almaadeed, Alkuri’s chairman. The manager of Works Capital LLC is Rich Williams, Alkuri’s Chief
Executive Officer.
•
The Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
agreed to purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and
conditions as the other PIPE Investors.
•
Until the first anniversary of Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
will have the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.
•
The Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri’s current directors and officers and the continuation of
directors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri’s current directors and officers.
•
Alkuri’s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of
the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the
extent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.
Interests of Babylon Holdings’ Directors and Officers in the Business Combination
In considering the recommendation of Alkuri’s board of directors in favor of the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, stockholders
should keep in mind that Babylon Holdings’ directors and officers may have interests in such proposal that are different from, or in addition to,
those of Alkuri Stockholders and warrant holders generally. These interests include, among other things, the interests listed below:
•
Entities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust, Babylon Holdings’ Chief Executive Officer and chairman of Babylon Holdings’ board of
directors, and his wife, Mairi Johnson, Babylon Holdings’ Chief

Table of Contents
Partnerships Officer and member of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, have agreed to purchase 200,000 Babylon Class A Shares
pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth,
member of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’ share
capital, and (ii) Georgi Ganev, member of Babylon’s board of directors, and Invik S.A., a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’
share capital, have each agreed to purchase 500,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the
same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.
•
Certain of Babylon Holdings’ directors and executive officers will serve as officers of Babylon following the consummation of the
Business Combination. As such, in the future they will receive any cash or equity-based compensation that the Babylon board
determines to pay to such officers. For additional information, see the section entitled “Management Following the Business
Combination.”
•
Dr. Ali Parsadoust will control shares representing approximately 81.7% of Babylon’s voting power (taking account of the Stockholder
Earnout Shares) upon completion of the Business Combination. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Earnout”.

take all action necessary to ensure that such nominee is (i) included in Babylon’s slate of director nominees and recommended by Babylon Holdings’
board of directors, and (ii) included in Babylon Holdings’ proxy statement when such nominee is up for election.

Shares and/or Babylon Warrants, please see the information set forth in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in this proxy
statement/prospectus.
Material Jersey Tax Considerations
For a description of material Jersey tax considerations including in connection with the ownership and disposition of Babylon Shares and/or
Babylon Warrants, please see the information set forth in “Material Jersey Tax Considerations”.
Redemption Rights
Pursuant to the SPAC Charter, a holder of Alkuri public shares may demand that Alkuri redeem such shares for cash if the business
combination is consummated; provided that Alkuri may not consummate the business combination if it has less than $5,000,001 of net tangible
assets either immediately prior to or upon consummation of the business combination. Holders of Alkuri public shares will be entitled to receive
cash for these shares only if they deliver their shares to Alkuri’s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the special meeting.
Holders of Alkuri public shares do not need to affirmatively vote on the Business Combination Proposal or be a holder of such Alkuri public shares
as of the record date to exercise redemption rights. If the Business Combination is not consummated, these shares will not be redeemed for cash. If a
holder of Alkuri public shares properly demands such redemption, delivers his, her or its shares to Alkuri’s transfer agent as described above, and
the Business Combination is consummated, Alkuri will redeem each Alkuri public share into a full pro rata portion of the trust account, calculated as
of two (2) business days prior to the date of the special meeting. It is anticipated that this would amount to approximately 10.00 per share. If a holder
of Alkuri public shares exercises his, her or its conversion rights, then it will be redeeming shares of Alkuri Common Stock for cash and will not
become a shareholder of Babylon. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “Special Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders—Conversion
Rights” for a detailed description of the procedures to be followed if you wish to convert your shares into cash.
Holders of Alkuri Warrants do not have redemption rights with respect to such securities.
Babylon is considering market conditions including the possibility of requests for redemptions by Alkuri stockholders in connection with the
Business Combination. Babylon has engaged Ardea Partners LP (“Ardea”) and Citigroup Global Markets Limited (“Citi”) to explore potential
additional sources of funding to supplement the combined Company’s cash balance following the Closing. Babylon is evaluating obtaining debt
financing with a principal ranging between $100 million and $200 million to be entered into concurrently with or shortly after the Closing on
customary terms, which may include security interests, restrictive covenants and/or warrants for the purchase of shares of Babylon. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Babylon’s Business and Operations Following the Business Combination—We may require additional capital to
support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.”
Appraisal Rights
Alkuri Stockholders and holders of Alkuri Warrants do not have appraisal rights in connection with the Transactions under the DGCL. See the
section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “Special Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders—Appraisal Rights.”
Voting Power; Record Date
Alkuri Stockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the special meeting if they owned Alkuri Class A Common Stock at the
close of business on September 14, 2021, which is the record date for the
14
Table of Contents
special meeting. Alkuri Stockholders will have one vote for each share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock owned at the close of business on the
record date. If your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker to ensure that votes related
to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. Alkuri Warrants do not have voting rights. On the record date, there were 12,792,156 shares
of Alkuri Class A Common Stock outstanding, of which 4,167,156 were Alkuri public shares with the rest being held by the Alkuri board of directors,
Alkuri’s officers and other initial stockholders and their respective affiliates (including the Sponsor).
The Equity Plan Proposal
Alkuri will ask its stockholders to approve and adopt, assuming the Business Combination Proposal is approved, the 2021 Plan, which, if
approved, would take effect upon Closing. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Equity Plan Proposal. See
the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “Proposal Two—The Equity Plan Proposal.”
The Adjournment Proposal
If Alkuri is unable to consummate the Business Combination at the time of the special meeting for any reason, the chairman presiding over the
special meeting may submit a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary. See the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus titled “Proposal Three—The Adjournment Proposal.”
Recommendation to Alkuri Stockholders
Alkuri’s board of directors has determined that each of the proposals outlined above is fair to and in the best interests of Alkuri and its
stockholders and recommended that Alkuri Stockholders vote “FOR” the Business Combination Proposal, “FOR” the Equity Plan Proposal and
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, if presented.
Comparison of Rights of Stockholders of Alkuri and Shareholders of Babylon
If the Business Combination is successfully completed, holders of Alkuri Common Stock will become holders of Babylon Class A Shares, and
their rights as shareholders will be governed by Babylon’s organizational documents. There are also differences between the laws governing Alkuri,
a Delaware corporation, and Babylon, a Jersey company. For more information, please see “Comparison of Rights of Babylon Shareholders and
Alkuri Stockholders” in this proxy statement/prospectus for more information.
Implications of being an “Emerging Growth Company” and a “Foreign Private Issuer”
Each of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings is, and consequently, following the Business Combination, Babylon will be, an “emerging growth
company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As
such, Babylon will be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in their periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on
executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find Babylon’s
securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Babylon’s securities and the prices of Babylon’s securities may be
more volatile.
Babylon will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the
closing of the Alkuri IPO, (b) in which Babylon has total annual gross
15
Table of Contents
revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which Babylon is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of Babylon’s common
equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter; and (ii) the
date on which Babylon has issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to
“emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Babylon Holdings is also considered a “foreign private issuer” and will report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the
“Exchange Act”) as a non-U.S. company with “foreign private issuer” status. This means that, even after Babylon Holdings no longer qualifies as an
“emerging growth company,” as long as it qualifies as a “foreign private issuer” under the Exchange Act, it will be exempt from certain provisions of
and intends to take advantage certain exemptions from the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. public companies, including:
•
the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered
under the Exchange Act;
•
the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for
insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and
Babylon Holdings may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until such time as it is no longer a “foreign private issuer.” Babylon
Holdings could lose its status as a “foreign private issuer” under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of Babylon Holdings’
outstanding voting securities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of the
Babylon Holding’s directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents; (ii) more than 50% of Babylon Holdings’ assets are located in the
United States; or (iii) Babylon Holdings’ business is administered principally in the United States.
Babylon Holdings’ may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. Babylon Holdings has taken advantage of
reduced reporting requirements in this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus may
be different from the information you receive from Babylon Holdings’ competitors that are public companies, or other public companies in which you
have made an investment. We expect to lose our foreign private issuer status for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of increased contacts
with the United States.
Regulatory Matters
The Business Combination is not subject to any federal or state regulatory requirement or approval, except for the filings with the State of
Delaware necessary to effectuate the Business Combination.
Summary Risk Factors
You should consider all the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus in deciding how to vote for the proposals presented in
this proxy statement/prospectus. In particular, you should consider the risk factors described under “Risk Factors” in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Babylon Holdings has a history of net losses, anticipates increasing expenses in the future, and may not be able to achieve or maintain
profitability;
•
Babylon Holdings’ relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and
increases the risk of your investment;
•
If Babylon Holdings fails to effectively manage its growth, Babylon Holdings may be unable to execute its business plan, adequately
address competitive challenges or maintain its corporate culture, and Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition and results of
operations would be harmed;
16
Table of Contents
•
Babylon Holdings’ business and growth strategy depend on Babylon Holdings’ ability to maintain and expand a network of qualified
providers. If Babylon is unable to do so, Babylon Holdings’ future growth would be limited and Babylon Holdings’ business, financial
condition and results of operations would be harmed;
•
Babylon Holdings is dependent on its relationships with physician-owned entities to hold contracts and provide healthcare services.
Babylon Holdings does not own such professional entities, and its business could be harmed if relationships with either those entities
or their owners were disrupted;
•
If Babylon Holdings is unable to attract new customers, Babylon Holdings’ revenue growth could be slower than expected, and
Babylon Holdings’ business may be adversely affected;
•
If Babylon Holdings’ existing customers do not continue to use Babylon Holdings’ services or renew their contracts with Babylon
Holdings, renew at lower fee levels or decline to purchase additional applications and services from Babylon Holdings, it could have a
material adverse effect on Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition and results of operations;
•
Babylon Holdings’ revenue sources are highly concentrated and the loss of any of its key contracts could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations;
•
Under many of Babylon Holdings’ agreements with health plans, Babylon Holdings assumes some or all of the risk that the cost of
providing services will exceed Babylon Holdings’ compensation. Over time, Babylon Holdings expects the proportion of risk-based
revenue may increase. Babylon Holdings will not have control over these costs, particularly in cases where members use third party
services instead of Babylon Holdings’ services;
•
Babylon Holdings may face intense competition, which could limit Babylon Holdings’ ability to maintain or expand market share within
Babylon Holdings’ industry, and if Babylon Holdings does not maintain or expand Babylon Holdings’ market share, Babylon Holdings’
business and operating results will be harmed;
•
If Babylon Holdings is not able to develop and release new solutions and services, or successful enhancements, new features and
modifications to our existing solutions and services, Babylon Holdings’ business could be adversely affected;
•
There are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenue that Babylon Holdings recognizes under Babylon
Holdings’ licensing agreements, and risk-based agreements with health plans, and if Babylon Holdings’ estimates of revenue are
materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of Babylon Holdings’ revenue recognition or have a material adverse
effect on Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;
•
Security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to Babylon Holdings’ business or
members, or prevent Babylon Holdings from accessing critical information and expose Babylon Holdings to liability, which could
adversely affect Babylon Holdings’ business and reputation;
•
Babylon Holdings’ use, disclosure, and other processing of personally identifiable information, including health information, is subject
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic
and Clinical Health Act, (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, GDPR, the DPA 2018 and other privacy, and security
regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information Babylon holds could result in
significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on Babylon’s customer base, member base and revenue;
•
If Babylon Holdings is unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for Babylon Holdings’ technology or if
the scope of our intellectual property protection is not sufficiently
17
Table of Contents
broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology substantially similar to that of Babylon Holdings, and Babylon’s
ability to successfully commercialize our technology may be adversely affected;
•
Babylon Holdings may become subject to medical liability claims, which could cause Babylon Holdings to incur significant expenses
and may require Babylon Holdings to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance;
•
Babylon Holdings has been, and may in the future become, subject to litigation or regulatory investigation, which could harm Babylon
Holdings’ business;
•
Babylon Holdings relies on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software and other third
parties for providing services to Babylon Holdings’ customers and members, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by
these third parties could expose Babylon Holdings to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with customers and members,
adversely affecting Babylon’s operating results;
•
Babylon Holdings conducts business in a heavily regulated industry and if Babylon Holdings fails to comply with these laws and
government regulations, or if the rules and regulations change or the approach that regulators take in classifying Babylon Holdings’
products and services under such regulations change, Babylon Holdings could incur penalties or be required to make significant
changes to Babylon Holdings’ operations, products, or services or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse
effect on Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition, and results of operations;
•
The impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on Babylon
Holdings is currently unknown, but may adversely affect Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition and results of operations;
•
Babylon Holdings depends on its talent to grow and operate our business, and if Babylon Holdings is unable to hire, integrate,
develop, motivate and retain personnel, Babylon Holdings may not be able to grow effectively; and
•

Defined terms included below shall have the same meaning as terms defined and included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Introduction
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presents the pro forma effects of the following transactions:
•
the Business Combination; and
•
the Higi acquisition. As described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Babylon Holdings has an option to acquire Higi. See
“—Description of the Business Combination.”
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of financial position as of June 30, 2021 (“Pro Forma Statement of Financial
Position”) give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they were consummated on June 30, 2021. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive loss (“Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss”) for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and six months ended June 30, 2021 give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they
had occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma statements of financial position do not purport to represent, and are not necessarily indicative of,
what the actual financial condition of Babylon would have been had the Business Combination and Higi acquisition taken place on June 30, 2021, as
applicable, nor are they indicative of the financial condition of Babylon as of any future date. The pro forma statements of profit and loss do not
purport to represent, and are not necessarily indicative of, what the actual results of operations of Babylon would have been had the Business
Combination and Higi acquisition taken place on January 1, 2020, as applicable, nor are they indicative of the results of operations of Babylon for
any future period. The unaudited pro forma adjustments represent management’s estimates based on information available as of the date of these
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and analyses
are performed.
This information should be read together with the audited and unaudited historical financial statements of each of Alkuri, Babylon Holdings
and Higi, including the notes thereto, as well as the disclosures contained in the sections titled “Babylon’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Alkuri’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the following
historical financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus:
•
Babylon Holdings’ historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021;
•
Babylon Holdings’ historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020;
•
Higi’s historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021;

•
Alkuri’s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021; and
•
Alkuri’s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. As a newly
incorporated business on December 1, 2020, the results of Alkuri prior to January 1, 2021 were not material.
The historical consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in its presentation currency
of USD. The historical financial statements of Alkuri and Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of
USD. In the case of Alkuri and Higi, adjustments were made to conform the U.S. GAAP financial statements to IFRS. Accordingly, pro forma
adjustments have been reflected to conform the basis of accounting and accounting policies for Alkuri and Higi to those of Babylon Holdings. The
historical consolidated financial statements of Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of USD and have
been adjusted to give effect to material differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information.
Description of the Business Combination
Babylon Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement, dated June 3, 2021, by and among Babylon Holdings, Merger Sub, Alkuri and the
Sponsor, which, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Babylon (the “Business Combination”). For more information about the Business Combination, please see the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
On May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a
network of Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series of investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on
a fully diluted basis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option to continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all
proposed investments, it will hold over 25% of Higi’s shareholdings on a fully diluted basis.
On June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three
largest shareholders in Higi. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon’s option to purchase the
remaining shares of Higi will be exercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon
would provide registration rights to such shareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare
and Wrigley agreed to be paid in shares of Babylon Holdings in lieu of cash.
The contemplated consideration for the Higi acquisition is $70.3 million. Accordingly, the parties expect to issue up to 6.4 million shares of
Babylon Holdings as the consideration in the transaction, with each share of Babylon Holdings to be valued at $10 per share although shareholders
other than 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley may elect to accept cash in lieu of shares. Because of the agreement reached in the Letter Agreement, Babylon
Holdings will issue at least 3.9 million shares of Babylon Holdings as the consideration in the transaction. In connection with the Higi acquisition,
certain continuing employees, as determined by Babylon, will receive restricted stock units granted in respect of Babylon Class A Shares (“Babylon
RSUs”), valued at $10. Babylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon
Holdings. As such, the historical financial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma
Statement of Financial Position assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss
assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred on January 1, 2020.

Accounting for the Business Combination
The Business Combination with Alkuri will be accounted for as a merger in accordance with IFRS. Under this method of accounting, Alkuri will
be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Babylon Holdings has accounted for its acquisition of Alkuri as a Business
Combination because Babylon is considered the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on the assumptions that Babylon
Holdings’ shareholders will hold a majority of the voting power of Babylon, Babylon Holdings’ operations will substantially comprise the ongoing
operations of Babylon, Babylon Holdings’ designees are expected to comprise a majority of the governing body of Babylon, and Babylon Holdings’
senior management will comprise the senior management of Babylon. Because Alkuri does not meet the definition of a business in accordance with
IFRS 3, Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”) (“IFRS 3”), and the net assets of Alkuri primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Business
Combination is accounted for as a Business Combination whereby the net assets of Alkuri will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other
intangible assets recorded. However, any excess of the share consideration issued by Babylon over the fair value of Alkuri’s identifiable net assets
acquired represents compensation for the service of a share exchange listing for its shares and is expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 2,
Share-based payment (“IFRS 2”). Accordingly, the excess of the fair value of the share consideration in excess of the net book value of the assets of
Alkuri has been reflected as a recapitalization transaction expense in the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss. Operations prior to the Business
Combination will be deemed to be those of Babylon Holdings.
Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to
provide an understanding of Babylon upon consummation of the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation
S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.” Release
No. 33-10786 replaces the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for the transaction
(“Transaction Accounting Adjustments”) and present the reasonably estimable synergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or are
reasonably expected to occur (“Management’s Adjustments”). Babylon Holdings has elected not to present Management’s Adjustments and will
only be presenting Transaction Accounting Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been
different had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information as
being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that Babylon
will achieve. Babylon and Alkuri have not had any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments
were required to eliminate activities between the companies.

Table of Contents
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared assuming two alternative levels of redemption into
cash of Alkuri Common Stock:
•
Scenario 1 – Assuming no redemptions for cash: This presentation assumes that no Alkuri Stockholders exercise redemption rights
with respect to their shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon consummation of the Business Combination; and
•
Scenario 2 – Assuming redemptions of 34,500,000 of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash: This presentation assumes that Alkuri
Stockholders exercise their redemption rights with respect to a maximum of 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon
consummation of the Business Combination at a redemption price of approximately $10.00 per share. The maximum redemption amount
reflects the redemption of all outstanding Alkuri Class A Common Stock given the minimum requirements in the Merger Agreement of
$230 million of cash held either in or outside of the trust account, including the aggregate amount of any proceeds from the PIPE
Investment, after giving effect to the payments to redeeming Alkuri Stockholders. Scenario 2 includes all adjustments contained in
Scenario 1 and presents additional adjustments to reflect the effect of maximum redemptions.
After the Closing, assuming no redemptions of shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash, Alkuri Stockholders and the Sponsor will
own 9.8% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Shares and 1,300,000 shares from the PIPE Investment), the PIPE Investors will
own approximately 5.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including shares purchased by the Founder, Sponsor and certain existing Babylon
Holdings shareholders in the PIPE Investment) and the existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will own approximately 85.0% of the outstanding
Babylon Shares. Additionally, the capitalization table includes Earnout Class A Shares issued to the Sponsor of 0.3% and Earnout Class B Shares
issued to the Founder of 8.8%. Assuming redemption by holders of all 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock, the Sponsor will own
approximately 1.8% of the outstanding Babylon Shares, the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.7% of outstanding Babylon Shares and the
existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will own approximately 92.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (in each case, not giving effect to any
shares purchased by the Founder, the Sponsor and existing Babylon Holdings shareholders in the PIPE Investment and any shares issuable upon
the exercise or conversion of warrants or options outstanding). The Sponsor will own an additional 0.3% of the outstanding Babylon shares and the
Founder will own an additional 9.5% of the outstanding Babylon shares as a result of the Earnout Class A and B Shares issued and outstanding.
The foregoing does not reflect the effect of the exercise of the 5,933,333 private placement warrants held by the Sponsor or the 8,625,000 public
warrants. Assuming all of the private placement warrants and public warrants are exercised and the earnout milestones are met such that the Earnout
Shares are not subject to the repurchase right, (i) there would be a total of 441,352,107 shares of Babylon Holdings outstanding (assuming no
redemptions) and (ii) there would be a total of 406,852,107 shares of Babylon Holdings (assuming maximum redemptions).

Table of Contents
Babylon’s statement of financial position was derived from the unaudited consolidated statement of financial position as of June 30, 2021
prepared in accordance with IFRS. Higi’s statement of financial position was extracted from the unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,
2021. The Higi statement of financial position was prepared in accordance of U.S. GAAP. The Alkuri statement of financial position was extracted
from the unaudited condensed balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
(A)
To reflect the proceeds received from the PIPE Investment with the corresponding issuance of 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares at
approximately US$10.00 per share, or $230 million.
(B)
To reflect the release of cash from marketable securities held in the trust account.
(C)
To reflect the elimination of historical accumulated deficit in Alkuri as it is the accounting acquiree.
(D)
To reflect the settlement of Alkuri’s historical current liabilities at Closing.
(E)
To reflect the reclassification of Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption of approximately $303 million from
temporary equity under U.S. GAAP to a liability under IFRS, because the right to redeem is at the option of the holder. The additional
adjustment is related to the reclassification of approximately $303 million of Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible
redemption to permanent equity.
(F)
The fair value of share consideration of $414 million and Alkuri’s net assets of $308 million result in an excess of the fair value of the
shares issued over the value of the net monetary assets acquired of $105 million. Assuming no redemptions, this was reflected as a
transaction expense of $106 million for the services provided by Alkuri in connection with the listing. The fair value calculation of $414
million is based on the combined company estimated fair value derived from Babylon’s enterprise valuation of $3.6 billion and the level
of ownership that existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will have in Babylon of approximately 85%, after taking into account the
Stockholder Earnout and Sponsor Earnout. The net assets were derived from Alkuri’s historical condensed consolidated financial
statements.
Fair value of share consideration
$ 413,749
Alkuri Net (Assets) / Liabilities
($308,328)
Transaction Expense
$ 105,421
Assuming maximum redemptions, the ownership in the combined company changes to 92% resulting in a reduction to the enterprise fair value.
Alkuri’s ownership percentage of 2% results in the fair value of the share consideration of $83 million. Similarly, there is a reduction in the net assets
by $317 million based on the redemptions, which results in a fair value excess of $119 million. The $14 million adjustment is to reflect this excess.

Table of Contents
(H)
To reflect the payment of an aggregate of $68.5 million of estimated legal, financial advisory and other professional fees that are directly
attributable to the equity issuance costs as part of the Business Combination, which is reflected as an adjustment to additional paid in
capital. These expenses were not previously accounted for in the financial statements as for the twelve months ended December 31,
2020 and as of June 30, 2021.
(I)
Reflects the maximum redemption of all 34,500,000 Alkuri Class A Common Stock for aggregate redemption payments of approximately
$345 million allocated to Babylon Class A Shares. The additional capital is based on using a par value $0.0001 per share and at a
redemption price of approximately $10.00 per share.

The Babylon Holdings’ statement of profit and loss was derived from the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
loss of Babylon Holdings for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The Higi statement of profit or loss
was derived from the unaudited consolidated statement of operations of Higi for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Alkuri’s statement of
operations was derived from the historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021. As a newly
incorporated business on December 1, 2020, the results of Alkuri prior to January 1, 2021 were not material.
Pro Forma Adjustments:
(J)
As discussed in (F) the listing expense charge to recapitalization transaction expenses is $105 million assuming no redemptions for the
year ended December 31, 2020. Under a maximum redemption scenario, the adjustment of $14 million reflects the expense of $119 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020.
(K)
Reflects the elimination of interest income on Alkuri’s Trust Account.
(L)
Reflects the adjustment related to the bridge financing obtained by Babylon. On August 18, 2021, the Group issued $50.0 million in
unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (“Unsecured Bonds”), including the non-cash conversion of $8.0 million in borrowings under
the loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds
can be used for general corporate purposes. For purposes of the pro forma statements, the Unsecured Bonds are shown to be repaid in
full once the transaction closes. Therefore, the capitalized costs associated with the financing have been expensed during the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020.

The historical information should be read in conjunction with the information in the sections entitled “Selected Historical Financial Data of
Alkuri” and “Selected Historical Financial Information of Babylon Holdings” and the historical financial statements of Alkuri, Babylon Holdings
and Higi included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The Babylon Holdings pro forma equivalent per share financial information is calculated by multiplying the combined unaudited pro forma per
share amounts by the exchange ratio, whereby each share of Babylon Holdings ordinary shares are converted into Babylon Shares at a conversion
ratio of approximately 0.3, and each share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into one Babylon Class A Share.

Table of Contents
1.)
The classification of certain items presented by Higi under U.S. GAAP has been adjusted in order to align with the presentation of Babylon
under IFRS.
Modification to Higi’s historical consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include:
•
Presentation of Depreciation of Higi stations ($0.1 million) and Other cost of revenue ($6.7 million) in Research and development
expenses ($6.8 million).
•
Separate presentation of components of Operating expenses ($12.5 million) to Research and development expenses ($8.8 million) and
Sales, general and administrative expenses ($3.7 million).
•
Presentation of Interest expense ($1.7 million) and Loss on discount related to conversion of promissory notes ($4.6 million) to Finance
costs ($6.3 million).
•
Presentation of Gain on extinguishment of debt ($3.0 million) to Finance income ($3.0 million).
•
Presentation of Other expenses ($0.2 million) in Sales, general & administrative expenses ($0.2 million).
Modification to Higi’s historical consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 include:
•
Presentation of Other cost of revenue ($3.6 million) in Research and development expenses ($3.6 million).
•
Separate presentation of components of Operating expenses ($7.0 million) to Research and development expenses ($5.1 million) and
Sales, general and administrative expenses ($1.9 million).
•
Presentation of Interest expense ($0.6 million) to Finance costs ($0.6 million).
•
Presentation of Forgiveness of paycheck protection program funds ($1.0 million) to Finance income ($1.0 million).
Modification to Higi’s historical consolidated balance sheet presentation include:
•
Presentation of Accounts receivable, net ($2.4 million) and Other current assets ($0.1 million) in Trade and other receivables ($2.5
million).
•
Presentation of Accounts Payable ($1.0 million) to Trade and other Payables ($1.0 million).
•
Presentation of Accrued expenses ($1.0 million) to Accruals and provisions ($1.0 million).
2.)
Higi has not adopted ASC 842, Leases, which becomes effective for private companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. In
accordance with IFRS 16, Leases¸ and Babylon’s accounting policies, right of use assets of $1.2 million and lease liabilities of $1.8 million have
been recognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2021. In addition, accrued rent liabilities of $0.3 million have been derecognized from the
balance sheet as of June 30, 2021. The impact of the adjustments to the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.
3.)
Under U.S. GAAP, Higi elected to apply the straight-line approach for graded vesting when measuring share- based payment awards. Under
IFRS, Babylon would use the graded vesting method, resulting in a higher proportion of cost being allocated to the earlier years. The impact of
the adjustments to the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.
Note 2. Preliminary Allocation of Purchase Price
On May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a
network of Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series
35
Table of Contents
of investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on a fully diluted basis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option
to continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all proposed investments, it will hold over 25% of Higi’s shareholdings on a fully
diluted basis.
On June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into the Letter Agreement with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three largest shareholders in
Higi. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon’s option to purchase the remaining shares of Higi
will be exercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon would provide registration
rights to such shareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley agreed to be paid
in shares of Babylon Holdings in lieu of cash.
Babylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon Holdings. As such,
the historical financial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma Statement of Financial
Position assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss assumes that the Higi
acquisition occurred on January 1, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, the total shareholding was 19.0% and 25%, respectively.
The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS and
assuming Babylon Holdings closed the Higi acquisition by purchasing the remaining 75% for estimated consideration with a fair value of
approximately $70.3 million. The Higi Acquisition was achieved in stages, which required Babylon Holdings to remeasure its previously held equity
interest in Higi at its acquisition date fair value. As no material control premium was determined to exist, estimated consideration transferred to
acquire the remaining stake in Higi was used to estimate the fair value of Babylon Holdings’ previously held equity interest. This remeasurement
resulted in gains of approximately $14.6 million and $ 10.8 million, which recorded in Other (income) expense within Babylon Holdings’ pro forma
consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred and the preliminary estimated fair values of the major classes of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired has been determined using prior
acquisitions as a benchmark for the purposes of a preliminary purchase price allocation.

The goodwill allocation of $56.4 million reflects expectations of favorable future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies through the scale
of our combined operations, and the assembled workforce.
Pro Forma Adjustments
The following pro forma adjustments were added to give effect to the Higi acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.
(AA)
Reflects the elimination of the previous investment related to Higi of $12.6 million and the step up to the fair value of prior existing equity
interest of $23.4 million. This step-up in fair value resulted in a gain of $10.8 million.
(BB)
To reflect the elimination of Higi’s historical equity.
(CC)
To reflect the consideration payment in the form of $5.2 million in cash, shares issued as consideration with an estimated fair value of $53.6
million fair value of existing equity interest of $23.4 million and $11.6 million in deferred consideration, resulting in an addition of goodwill of
$56.4 million and $53.6 million in additional paid capital.
(DD)
To reflect the elimination of historical intangible assets of $0.2 million along with the fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $31.9
million along with its respective impact on Deferred Tax Liabilities of $6.1 million. This results in a reduction of the addition to goodwill by
$25.8 million. Our preliminary estimate of the weighted average useful lives of the acquired intangible assets was determined to be 7.0 years
based on the useful lives assigned to comparable historical acquisitions. The amortization of the intangible assets over a 7.0 year period
resulted in an expense of $4.5 million and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021,
respectively.
(EE)
This adjustment is to reflect the payment of Higi’s debt using its cash on hand. If the cash on hand is not sufficient, part of the consideration
transferred will be used to settle the Related party convertible notes at Closing. This results in a reduction in the cash balance of $5.5 million,
elimination of $7.0 million of debt and a reduction of goodwill by $1.5 million.

If the Business Combination is completed, Babylon will operate in a market environment that is difficult to predict and that involves significant
risks, many of which will be beyond its control. You should carefully consider the risks described below before voting your shares. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to Babylon Holdings and Alkuri or that they do not currently believe are important to an investor, if they
materialize, also may adversely affect the Business Combination. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the
following risks actually occur, Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the
trading price of Babylon Class A Shares or, if the Business Combination is not consummated, Alkuri Common Stock could decline, and you may lose
part or all of the value of any Babylon Class A Shares or, if the Business Combination is not consummated, shares of Alkuri Common Stock that you
hold.
You should also consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus, including the Merger Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part.
Investing in Babylon Class A Shares involves risks, some of which are related to the Business Combination. In considering the Business
Combination, you should carefully consider the following information about these risks, as well as the other information included in or incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including Babylon Holdings’ consolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Babylon’s
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” The risks and uncertainties described below are those
significant risk factors, currently known and specific to us, that we believe are relevant to an investment in Babylon Class A Shares. Additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm us and adversely affect the Babylon Class A Shares.
You are also encouraged to read and consider the risk factors specific to Alkuri’s businesses (that may also affect Babylon) described in Alkuri’s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 because, as a result of the Business Combination, they will become our risks.
Please see “Where You Can Find More Information,” for information on where you can find the periodic reports and other documents we and
Alkuri have filed with or furnished to the SEC.
In this section “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Babylon Holdings prior to the Closing and Babylon following the Closing.
Risk Factors Summary
The below summary risks provide an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. The below
summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary risks below together with the more
detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading “Risk Factors,” as well as elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The summary risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones Babylon Holdings faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to Babylon Holdings or that it currently deems less significant may also affect Babylon Holdings’ business operations or financial results.
Consistent with the foregoing, Babylon Holdings is exposed to a variety of risks, including those associated with the following:
•
Babylon Holdings has a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and it may not be able to achieve or maintain
profitability.
•
Babylon Holdings’ relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects and increases
the risk of your investment.
38Table of Contents

If Babylon Holdings fails to effectively manage its growth, Babylon Holdings may be unable to execute its business plan, adequately
address competitive challenges or maintain its corporate culture, and its business, financial condition and results of operations would be
harmed.
•
Babylon Holdings’ business and growth strategy depend on its ability to maintain and expand a network of qualified providers. If Babylon
Holdings is unable to do so, its future growth would be limited and its business, financial condition and results of operations would be
harmed.

Babylon Holdings is dependent on its relationships with physician-owned entities to hold contracts and provide healthcare services.
Babylon Holdings does not own such professional entities, and its business could be harmed if relationships with either those entities or
their owners were disrupted.
•
If Babylon Holdings is unable to attract new customers and expand member enrollment with existing customers, its revenue growth could be
slower than it expects, and its business may be adversely affected.
•
If Babylon Holdings’ existing customers do not continue to use its services or renew their contracts with Babylon Holdings, renew at lower
fee levels or decline to purchase additional applications and services from Babylon Holdings, it could have a material adverse effect on
Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Babylon Holdings’ revenue sources are highly concentrated, and the loss of any key contracts could have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Under many of Babylon Holdings’ agreements with health plans, Babylon Holdings assumes some or all of the risk that the cost of
providing services will exceed its compensation. Over time, Babylon Holdings expects the proportion of risk-based revenue may increase.
Babylon Holdings will not have control over these costs, particularly in cases where members use third party services instead of Babylon
Holdings’ services.

If Babylon Holdings is not able to develop and release new solutions and services, or successful enhancements, new features and
modifications to its existing solutions and services, Babylon Holdings’ business could be adversely affected.
•
There are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenue that Babylon Holdings recognizes under its licensing
agreements, and risk-based agreements with health plans, and if Babylon Holdings’ estimates of revenue are materially inaccurate, it could
impact the timing and the amount of its revenue recognition or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to the Business Combination
The completion of the Business Combination is subject to a number of important conditions, and the Merger Agreement may be terminated before
the completion of the Business Combination in accordance with its terms. As a result, there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be
completed.
The completion of the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of a number of important conditions set forth in
the Merger Agreement, including the approval of the Business Combination by the Alkuri Stockholders, the approval of the listing of the Babylon Class
A Shares on the NYSE, and several other customary closing conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or, if applicable, waived by December 3, 2021,
unless extended, the Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party and you will not receive the Merger Consideration. For more information, see
“The Merger Agreement.”
The unaudited pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus may not be representative of Babylon’s results after the

prospective financial
40
Table of Contents
information of Babylon is based in part on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our assumptions may not prove
to be accurate over time.
Babylon Holdings’ projections are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties. As a result, Babylon’s projected revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from expectations.
Babylon Holdings’ operates in a rapidly changing and competitive industry and its projections will be subject to the risks and assumptions made
by management with respect to its industry. Operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on a number of factors, including
the competition Babylon Holdings’ faces, and its ability to attract and retain customers and enterprise partnerships, while generating sustained revenues.
This may result in decreased revenue levels, and Babylon Holdings may be unable to adopt measures in a timely manner to compensate for any
unexpected shortfall in income. This inability could cause Babylon Holdings’ operating results in a given quarter to be higher or lower than expected.
These factors make creating accurate forecasts and budgets challenging and, as a result, Babylon Holdings may fall materially short of its forecasts and
expectations, which could cause its stock price to decline and investors to lose confidence in it.
The Business Combination may not result in increased share liquidity for Babylon’s shareholders, including former Alkuri Stockholders, following
the Business Combination.
We are undertaking the Business Combination because we believe that the Business Combination will provide Babylon Holdings and Alkuri, and
their and our respective shareholders, with a number of advantages, including providing our shareholders and Alkuri Stockholders with securities that we
expect will enjoy greater market liquidity than the securities these shareholders currently hold. However, the Business Combination may not accomplish
these objectives particularly given the number of shares to be held by Babylon or Alkuri affiliates and the right of Alkuri Stockholders to redeem their
Alkuri Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether a liquid market for the
newly issued Babylon Class A Shares will be maintained. If the Business Combination does not result in increased liquidity for the securities held by
Babylon Holdings’ shareholders and Alkuri Stockholders, you may experience a decrease in your ability to sell the Babylon Class A Shares you receive in
the Business Combination compared to your ability to sell the Alkuri Common Stock you currently hold.
Due to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition
companies, the Business Combination is not expected to qualify as a tax-deferred “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code, in which case
the Business Combination will be a taxable transaction with respect to U.S. holders of Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants.
Due to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition
companies and the risk that similar levels of redemptions could occur in connection with the Business Combination, the Business Combination is not
expected to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction, including as a “reorganization” under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that is the
case, holders of Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants will generally be treated as if they sold their Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants in a
taxable transaction and will be taxable on the receipt of the Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants in the Business Combination.
No ruling has been requested, nor is one intended to be requested, from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business
Combination. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination is subject to both legal and factual uncertainty, is not free from doubt,
and may change depending on the actual level of redemptions that occur in connection with the Business Combination. No opinion of counsel has or will
be provided regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination. Consequently, no assurance can be given whether the IRS will
assert, or that a court would sustain, a position contrary to that described above.
For additional information, please read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” The tax consequences to you of
the Business Combination will depend on your particular facts

and circumstances. Please consult your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the Business Combination in your particular circumstances,
including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws.
Your ownership percentage in Babylon will be less than the ownership percentage you currently hold in Alkuri.
Your ownership percentage in Babylon Class A Shares following the Business Combination will be less than your existing ownership percentage in
Alkuri as a result of dilution attributable to the relative equity values of the companies involved in the Business Combination. Immediately after the
consummation of the Business Combination, it is anticipated that: (i) Alkuri’s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the Babylon Shares and
2.2% of the voting power of Babylon; (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power of
Babylon; (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Earnout Shares) and
0.6% of the voting power of Babylon; and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the Babylon Shares and
95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power of Babylon being held by the Founder). These levels of ownership interest: (a)
exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination; (b) assume
that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri’s trust account and (c)
excludes the impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing also excludes shares being purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment.
When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2%
of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon assuming no redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the
voting power of Babylon assuming maximum redemptions. As a result, Alkuri Stockholders will have less influence over matters submitted to a vote of
Babylon shareholders than they currently hold in Alkuri.
Alkuri’s stockholders will experience dilution as a consequence of the Business Combination.
It is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination, assuming that no shares of Alkuri Common Stock are elected to be redeemed
by Alkuri stockholders and subject to the assumptions set forth below, the concentration of ownership of Babylon immediately following the
consummation of the Business Combination will be as follows:

The calculation of implied value per share assumes (i) an enterprise value of approximately $3.6 billion for Babylon, (ii) $230 million of cash
proceeds received from the PIPE transaction upon consummation of the business combination, and (iii) approximately $345 million of funds in the Alkuri
trust account immediately prior to any redemptions.
The ownership percentages of Babylon set forth in the foregoing tables (a) exclude (1) the Babylon Class A Shares issuable upon the exercise of
warrants that will remain outstanding following the Business Combination and (2) any Babylon Class A Shares issuable upon the conversion of equity
awards issued to holders of outstanding equity awards in connection with the Business Combination, and (b) assume (1) the completion of the Business
Combination occurs promptly following the Alkuri Stockholder meeting to which this proxy statement relates, (2) that approximately 401,258,357 Babylon
Class A Shares (in the no redemption scenario), 384,008,357 Babylon Class A Shares (in the fifty percent (50%) redemption scenario), and 366,758,357
Babylon Class A Shares (in the maximum redemption scenario) are outstanding immediately after consummation of the Business Combination. For more
information, please see the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” Additionally, in the columns marked
“Ownership Percentage Assuming the Completion of the Higi Acquisition,” the ownership percentages of Babylon assume the completion of the Higi
acquisition and the issuance of an additional 6.4 million shares of Babylon Holdings as consideration in the transaction (although certain shareholders
may elect to accept cash in lieu of shares). Please see the section entitled “Beneficial Ownership of Securities” for more information regarding beneficial
ownership of Babylon Class A Shares and projected beneficial ownership of Babylon Class A Shares following the consummation of the Business
Combination.

Directors of Alkuri have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that stockholders vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination and
approval of the other proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus.
When considering the Alkuri board of directors’ recommendation that Alkuri Stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Business
Combination, Alkuri Stockholders should be aware that Alkuri’s directors and executive officers, advisors and entities affiliated with them, have interests
in the Business Combination that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Alkuri Stockholders. These interests include:
•
If the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as
may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming 100% of the
outstanding public shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of directors, dissolving and
liquidating. In such event, the Sponsor Shares held by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s directors and officers, which were acquired for an
aggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to participate in any
redemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based upon the closing
price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each
outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
•
The Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private warrant. This purchase took place on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from these purchases
were placed in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $8,484,666 based upon the closing price
of $1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants had an
aggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The private
warrants and the Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants will become worthless if Alkuri does not
consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment
to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each outstanding whole warrant will become a
Babylon warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon ordinary share following consummation of the Business Combination and each
outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
•
Alkuri’s initial stockholders and owners of private placement warrants paid significantly less for their shares and warrants than other current
stockholders and holders of warrants paid for their shares and warrants purchased in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market thereafter. Prior to
the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or
approximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri’s IPO and the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-
allotment option, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of which entitles the holder
to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per warrant. Each
outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a target value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00. If
the Business Combination is consummated, based on the difference in the purchase price of $0.003 per share that the Sponsor paid for the
Sponsor Shares, as compared to the purchase price of $10.00 per Unit sold in the IPO, these initial stockholders and holders of private
placement warrants will be able, at a lower price per share of Babylon Class A Common Stock, to recognize a greater return on their
investment than stockholders or holders of warrants that purchased Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri warrants in the Alkuri IPO or in the
open market thereafter. Furthermore, the Sponsor may earn a positive rate of return even if the share price of the Babylon Shares after the
Closing falls below the price initially paid for the units in the IPO and the Alkuri Stockholders may experience a negative rate of return
following the Closing of the Business Combination.

•
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, of the 7,187,500 Sponsor Shares that will be converted into 7.187,500 Babylon Class A shares at
Closing, 1,293,750 shares (which we refer to herein as the Sponsor Earnout Shares) will be subject to restrictions if and until milestones
based on the achievement of certain price targets of Babylon Class A following the Closing are met. In the event such milestones are not
met, all of the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Babylon which Babylon can redeem for an
aggregate consideration of $1.00.
•
If Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under certain
circumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims
of vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri
consummates a business combination, on the other hand, Alkuri will be liable for all such claims.
•
The Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them
in connection with certain activities on Alkuri’s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business
combinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have any claim
against the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business Combination
or another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an
amendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their affiliates had incurred
approximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.
•
If Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the aggregate dollar amount of non-reimbursable
funds is $98,230,402, comprised of (a) $85,646,250 representing the market value of Sponsor Shares, (b) $8,484,666 representing the market
value of private placement warrants and (c) $4,099,486 of unpaid expenses incurred by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and
their affiliates. Certain Alkuri directors and executive officers have indirect economic interests in the private placement warrants and in the
Sponsor Shares. This includes indirect economic interests in 25,000 Sponsor Shares held by each of Katie May and Stephen Smith and
indirect economic interests in 30,000 Sponsor Shares held by Jason Harinstein. Jason Harinstein, Katie May and Stephen Smith are
independent directors of Alkuri. Envst Opportunities LLC and Works Capital LLC may be deemed to have shared beneficial ownership of
the Sponsor Shares and private placement warrants held directly by the Sponsor. The managing member of Envst Opportunities LLC is
Sultan Almaadeed, Alkuri’s chairman. The manager of Works Capital LLC is Rich Williams, Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer.
•
The Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have agreed
to purchase an aggregate amount of 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same
terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.
The Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors own common stock and warrants that will be worthless and have incurred reimbursable expenses
that may not be reimbursed or repaid if the Business Combination is not approved and that may entitle them to a greater return on their initial investment
than other public stockholders or holders of warrants if the Business Combination is approved.
•
Until the first anniversary of the Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
will have the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.
45
Table of Contents
•
The Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri’s current directors and officers and the continuation of
directors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri’s current directors and officers.
•
Alkuri’s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the
extent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.
These financial interests of the officers and directors, and entities affiliated with them, may have influenced their decision to approve the Business
Combination. You should consider these interests when evaluating the Business Combination and the recommendation to vote in favor of the Business
Combination Proposal and other proposals to be presented to Alkuri Stockholders.
Jefferies has a potential conflict of interest regarding the Business Combination.
As disclosed elsewhere herein, Jefferies served as the sole underwriter for the Alkuri IPO and will receive approximately $12.1 million of deferred
underwriting commissions therefrom in connection with the consummation of Alkuri’s initial business combination. Jefferies has agreed to waive its
rights to its deferred underwriting commissions held in the Trust Account in the event that Alkuri does not complete its initial business combination prior
to the end of the completion window (subject to any extension period thereof), and in such a circumstance, will not receive any of such funds.
As described further below, Jefferies is also providing certain services in connection with the Transactions and will receive compensation in
connection therewith. Jefferies’ receipt of the deferred underwriting commissions is not dependent on its provision of services in connection with the
Transactions.
As discussed under “Proposal No. 1—The Business Combination Proposal—Background of the Business Combination,” Jefferies is serving as
Alkuri’s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies’ engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to provide
Alkuri with financial advice and assistance in connection with the Transactions, including providing financial advice on the potential business
combination with Babylon Holdings, assisting Alkuri in requesting and analyzing due diligence information received from Babylon Holdings, reviewing
financial information of Babylon Holdings, developing presentations for the Alkuri board of directors and providing other customary financial advisory
and investment banking services. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies will receive a financial advisory fee of $10 million (the “Jefferies
Financial Advisory Fee”). Alkuri also has agreed to provide Jefferies with customary expense reimbursement, including fees and expenses of its counsel,
and to indemnify it and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of Jefferies’ financial advisory engagement and the Transactions. No entity
(other than Jefferies) is serving as Alkuri’s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions.
Additionally, as discussed under “Proposal No. 1—The Business Combination Proposal—Background of the Business Combination,” Jefferies is
serving as lead placement agent in connection with the PIPE Investment together with Citi and Pareto Securities AB. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies’
placement agent engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to assist Alkuri in (i) identifying and contacting potential PIPE Investors, (ii) preparing an
investor presentation and/or marketing materials for distribution to potential PIPE Investors, (iii) soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Babylon Class
A shares pursuant to the PIPE Investment and (iv) negotiating the financial aspects of the PIPE Investment on Alkuri’s behalf. In respect of such
services, upon the consummation of the Transactions, the placement agents, including Jefferies, will collectively receive a placement fee equal to 3.0% of
the aggregate price at which such Babylon Class A shares are sold pursuant to the PIPE Investment, which is expected to be $6.9 million in the aggregate
and of which $738,000 will be payable to Jefferies (the “Jefferies Placement Fee”), and whether or not the Transactions are consummated, Jefferies will
46
Table of Contents
receive expense reimbursement customary for a PIPE transaction of this nature (subject to the terms and conditions of its engagement letter with Alkuri).
Alkuri also has agreed to indemnify Jefferies and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of its placement agent engagement or information
contained in or omitted from the offering materials in connection with the PIPE Investment.
Because (i) Jefferies will only receive its deferred underwriting commissions upon the consummation of Alkuri’s initial business combination during
the completion window (subject to any extension period thereof), (ii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Financial Advisory Fee upon the
consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Placement Fee upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies
has an interest in the Transactions being consummated. Such interest may have presented, and may in the future present, a conflict of interest. Alkuri was
aware of and considered such potential conflicts in engaging Jefferies as its financial advisor and as lead placement agent. Alkuri’s stockholders should
consider the role of Jefferies in evaluating “Proposal No. 1—The Business Combination Proposal” and the other proposals.
Following the completion of the Business Combination, the Founder will have the ability to significantly influence Babylon’s business and
management.
It is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri’s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of Babylon Shares
and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon; (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power of
Babylon; (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon; and (iv)
the existing Babylon Holdings’ shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of Babylon Shares and 95.8% of the voting power of Babylon and 81.7% of the
voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon will be held by the Founder). These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude
the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination; (b) assume that no
Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri’s trust account and (c) exclude
the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. Accordingly, the Founder will be able to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval,
including the election and removal of directors, the approval of actions requiring approval of the board of directors of Babylon through their voting
power, and will retain significant influence with respect to Babylon’s management, business plans and policies and corporate transactions, including the
appointment and removal of its officers, and corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Babylon or its assets. Our Founder may in certain
circumstances have sufficient voting control over Babylon to amend Babylon’s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights
attached to Babylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder terminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control of
Babylon following his separation and continue to have the rights described in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon.
Subsequent to the consummation of the Business Combination, Babylon may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and
impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and share price, which
could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.
Although Alkuri has conducted due diligence on Babylon Holdings, Alkuri cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that
may be present in its businesses, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that factors
outside of Alkuri’s or Babylon’s control will not later arise. As a result, Babylon may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its
operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks
may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with Alkuri’s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may
be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on Alkuri’s liquidity, the fact that Babylon Holdings or Babylon reports
47
Table of Contents
charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about Babylon or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause
Babylon to violate net worth or other covenants to which it may be subject. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain shareholders following
the Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their Babylon Shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such
reduction in value.
The board of directors of Alkuri did not obtain a fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the Business Combination, and as a
result, we cannot assure you that the terms of the transaction are fair, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Alkuri.
In analyzing the Business Combination, the Alkuri management team conducted due diligence on Babylon Holdings and engaged in
comprehensive discussions regarding the terms of the transaction, including the relative ownership of Babylon following the Business Combination.
Alkuri is not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the relative ownership of Babylon following the Business Combination is
fair to its stockholders from a financial point of view. Based on the due diligence efforts conducted, the scope of the negotiations, input from its financial
advisors, and the background of its board of directors and management, Alkuri’s board of directors has recommended that its stockholders approve the
Business Combination and adopt the Merger Agreement and related transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alkuri’s board of directors did not
obtain a formal fairness opinion to assist it in making this recommendation.
Babylon may redeem any unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that may be disadvantageous to the holder of such warrants, thereby
making your warrants worthless.
Babylon will have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of
$0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of Babylon Shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share
capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) on each of 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day
prior to proper notice of such redemption, and provided further that there is an effective registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable
upon exercise of the warrants, and a current prospectus relating thereto, available throughout the 30-day redemption period, or Babylon has elected to
require the exercise of the warrants on a “cashless basis,” and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the
warrants become redeemable by Babylon, it may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale
under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders (i) to exercise the warrants and pay the exercise
price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so, (ii) to sell the warrants at the then-current market price when the holder might otherwise
wish to hold its warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to
be substantially less than the market value of the warrants. The private placement warrants are not redeemable by Babylon so long as they are held by
the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.
The only principal asset of Babylon following the Business Combination will be its interest in its operating subsidiaries, and accordingly, it will
depend on distributions from the operating subsidiaries to pay taxes and expenses.
Upon consummation of the Business Combination, Babylon will be a holding company and will have no material assets other than its interests in
its operating subsidiaries. Babylon is not expected to have independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and its ability to pay taxes and
operating expenses, as well as dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries.
There can be no assurance that the operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to Babylon, or that applicable law and
contractual restrictions, including negative covenants under any debt instruments, if applicable, will permit such distributions. If the operating
subsidiaries do not distribute sufficient funds to Babylon to pay its taxes or other liabilities, Babylon may default on contractual
48
Table of Contents
obligations or have to borrow additional funds. In the event that the operating subsidiaries are required to borrow additional funds, it could adversely
affect Babylon’s liquidity and subject it to additional restrictions imposed by lenders.
The Sponsor and certain insiders of Alkuri have agreed to vote in favor of the Business Combination, regardless of how Alkuri Stockholders vote.
The Sponsor and certain insiders of Alkuri have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the Business Combination. The Sponsor owns 20% of
Alkuri Common Stock prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval for the Business
Combination will be received than would be the case if the Sponsor and certain insiders of Alkuri agreed to vote their shares in accordance with the
majority of the votes cast by Alkuri Stockholders.
Even if Alkuri consummates the Business Combination, there can be no assurance that the Alkuri Warrants will be in the money at the time they
become exercisable, and they may expire worthless.
The exercise price for the Alkuri Warrants is $11.50 per share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the Alkuri Warrants
will be in the money following the time they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, and as such, the Alkuri Warrants may expire worthless.
If Alkuri is unable to complete the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as
Alkuri Stockholders may approve), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, dissolving and liquidating. In such event,
third-parties may bring claims against Alkuri, and, as a result, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share liquidation
price received by Alkuri Stockholders could be less than $10.00 per share.
Under the terms of the Alkuri’s certificate of incorporation, Alkuri must complete the Business Combination or another business combination by
February 9, 2023, or Alkuri must: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than
ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest will be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to
pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish its public
stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly
as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and the Alkuri board of directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to its obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the
other requirements of applicable law. There will be no liquidating distributions with respect to Alkuri Warrants, which will expire worthless. In such event,
third-parties may bring claims against Alkuri. Although Alkuri has obtained waiver agreements from certain vendors and service providers (other than its
independent auditors) it has engaged and owes money to, and the prospective target businesses it has negotiated with, whereby such parties have
waived any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they or other
vendors who did not execute such waivers will not seek recourse against the trust account notwithstanding such agreements. Furthermore, there is no
guarantee that a court will uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to claims that
could take priority over those of Alkuri’s public stockholders.
The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to Alkuri if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to it, or
a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination
agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share
held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00
49
Table of Contents
per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or
prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is
enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under Alkuri’s indemnity of the underwriters in the Alkuri IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be
responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. Alkuri has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for its indemnification obligations, it has
not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy such obligations, and it believes that the Sponsor’s only assets are
securities of Alkuri. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for Alkuri’s initial business
combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, Alkuri may not be able to complete its initial business
combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares.
Alkuri’s directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of the Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the
trust account available for distribution to Alkuri Stockholders.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per public share
held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust
assets, in each case, less taxes payable, and the Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations
related to a particular claim, Alkuri’s independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against the Sponsor to enforce its
indemnification obligations.
While Alkuri currently expects that its independent directors would take legal action on its behalf against the Sponsor to enforce its
indemnification obligations to Alkuri, it is possible that Alkuri’s independent directors, in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary
duties, may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If Alkuri’s independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the
amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to Alkuri Stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.
If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to Alkuri Stockholders, Alkuri files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
petition is filed against it that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of Alkuri Stockholders
and the per share amount that would otherwise be received by Alkuri Stockholders in connection with its liquidation may be reduced.
If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to Alkuri Stockholders, Alkuri files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
petition is filed against it that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included
in Alkuri’s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third-parties with priority over the claims of its stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy
claims deplete the trust account, the per share amount that would otherwise be received by Alkuri Stockholders in connection with Alkuri’s liquidation
may be reduced.
Alkuri Stockholders may be held liable for claims by third-parties against Alkuri to the extent of distributions received by them.
If Alkuri is unable to complete the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings or another business combination within the required time period,
Alkuri will cease all operations, except for the purpose of winding up, liquidating and dissolving, subject to its obligations under Delaware law to provide
for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Alkuri cannot assure you that it will properly assess all claims that may be potentially
brought against it. As such, Alkuri Stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more),
and any liability of Alkuri Stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, Alkuri cannot assure you
that third parties will not seek to recover from Alkuri Stockholders amounts owed to them by Alkuri.
50
Table of Contents
If Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, any distributions received
by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent
conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by Alkuri’s stockholders. Furthermore, because Alkuri intends
to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to its public stockholders promptly after the expiration of the time period to complete an initial
business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to its public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to
access to or distributions from its assets. Furthermore, the Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to Alkuri’s creditors and/or
may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and the company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust
account before addressing the claims of creditors. Alkuri cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against it for these reasons.
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we are not registering the Babylon Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under
the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants,
thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and resell the underlying shares.
We are not registering the shares of Babylon Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at
this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement to be entered into prior to Closing, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than 15 business days after the Closing of the Business Combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a
registration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective
within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a
current prospectus relating to those Babylon Shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for
example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the
financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares
issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, we will be required to
permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the Babylon Shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based
on a formula set forth in the Warrant Agreement but, in any event, the number of Babylon Shares you will receive upon such cashless exercise will be less
than the number of shares that you would have received if you were able to exercise the warrants for cash. However, no warrant will be exercisable for
cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the
shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption from registration is
available. Notwithstanding the above, if Babylon Shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that
they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants
who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will
not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares
under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue
securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants
under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or
qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have
no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price
solely for the Babylon Shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private
placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants. In such an instance, the
Sponsor and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the
ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying
ordinary shares. If and when the
51
Table of Contents
warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Babylon Shares for
sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to
exercise their warrants.
Risks Related to the Adjournment Proposal
If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved, Alkuri’s board of directors will not have the ability to adjourn the special meeting to a later date.
If, at the special meeting, the chairman presiding over the special meeting determines that it would be in the best interests of Alkuri to adjourn the
special meeting to give Alkuri more time to consummate the Business Combination for whatever reason (such as if the Business Combination Proposal is
not approved, or if Alkuri would have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon the consummation of the
Transactions, or if additional time is needed to fulfil other closing conditions), the chairman presiding over the special meeting will seek approval to
adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates. If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved, the chairman will not have the ability to adjourn the
special meeting to a later date in order to solicit further votes. In such event, the Business Combination would not be completed.
Risks Related to Babylon’s Business and Operations Following the Business Combination
Unless stated otherwise, in this section, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Babylon Holdings prior to Closing and Babylon upon Closing.
We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.
We have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception. We incurred net losses of $188.0 million and $140.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We incurred net losses of $75.7 million and $90.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021,
respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $469.5 million and $544.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively. To date, we have
financed our operations principally from the sale of our equity and revenue from our operations. Our cash flow from operations was negative for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021. We may not generate positive cash flow from operations or profitability in
any given period, and our relatively limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and our future prospects.
We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing
industries, including increasing expenses. We expect our costs will increase substantially in the foreseeable future and our losses will continue as we
expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and operating as a public company. Additionally, we expect our operating
expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we continue to invest in increasing our customer base, hire additional personnel, expand
our marketing channels operations and infrastructure expand in the United States and other new geographies, pursue potential opportunities for growth
through acquisitions, and continue to develop and expand our solutions. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur
additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. These efforts and investments may prove to be more costly than we
anticipate, and if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the realization of these benefits is delayed, they may not result
in increased revenue or growth in our business to a level to sufficiently offset these higher expenses. If our growth rate were to decline significantly or
become negative, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow in
the long term, we may require additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and/or which would be dilutive to our
shareholders. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of
operations would be adversely affected. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our Babylon Class A Shares.
52
Table of Contents
If we fail to effectively manage our growth, we may be unable to execute our business plan, adequately address competitive challenges or maintain
our corporate culture, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.
Since launching our first product in 2015, we have experienced rapid growth and we continue to rapidly and significantly expand our operations.
For example, our employee headcount has grown from 789 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 2,189 employees as of September 6, 2021. This expansion
increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance,
financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our
reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results.
The growth and expansion of our business creates significant challenges for our management, operational and financial resources. In the event of
continued growth of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our information technology systems and our internal controls and
procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial
and management processes and systems and to effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. As our organization continues to grow and we
are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our
corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative solutions. This could negatively affect our business
performance.
We continue to experience growth in our headcount and operations, which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our
operational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees,
and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to
offer, highly competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, fluctuations in the price of our
Babylon Class A Shares may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. We face
significant competition for talent from other healthcare, technology and high-growth companies, which include both large enterprises and privately-held
companies. We may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and
successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer,
and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our solutions could suffer, which could
negatively affect our results of operations and overall business. Further, we have made changes in the past, and will likely make changes in the future, to
our solutions that our customers or members may not like, find useful or agree with. We may also decide to discontinue certain features, solutions or
services or increase fees for any of our features or services. If customers or members are unhappy with these changes, they may decrease their usage of
our solutions.
We may face intense competition, which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry, and if we do not maintain or
expand our market share our business and operating results will be harmed.
The market for our offerings is underpenetrated, competitive, and characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, customer and member
needs, and the frequent introduction of new products and services. While our market is in an early stage of development, it is evolving rapidly and
becoming increasingly competitive, and we expect it to attract increased competition. We currently face competition from a range of companies. Our
competitors include companies whose primary business is developing and marketing remote healthcare platforms and services and also those engaged in
value-based care, such as agilon health, Amwell, Oak Street Health, One Medical and Teladoc. We also compete with health insurers and large
corporations that are making inroads into the digital healthcare industry and that are increasingly focused on the development of
53
Table of Contents
digital health technology, often through initiatives and partnerships. These technology companies, which may offer their solutions at lower prices, are
continuing to develop additional products and are becoming more sophisticated and effective. In addition, large, well-financed healthcare providers and
insurance carriers have, in some cases, developed their own platform or tools and may provide these solutions to their customers at discounted prices.
Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to distinguish our company and our solution from our competitors and their products, and
includes factors such as:
•
long-term outcomes;
•
ease of use and convenience;
•
price;
•
greater name and brand recognition;
•
longer operating histories;
•
greater market penetration;
•
larger and more established customer and channel partner relationships;
•
larger sales forces and more established products and networks;
•
larger marketing budgets;
•
access to significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources;
•
breadth, depth, and efficacy of offerings;
•
quality and reliability of solutions; and
•
employer, healthcare provider, government agency and insurance carrier acceptance.
Some of our competitors may have greater name and brand recognition, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources than we do and
may be able to offer solutions similar to ours at more attractive prices than we can. Further, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third
parties with greater available resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing
opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In
addition, our competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products,
technologies or services to increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace.
Our partners and customers could become our competitors by offering similar services. Some of our partners may begin to offer services in the
same or similar manner as we do. Although there are many potential opportunities for, and applications of, these services, our partners may seek
opportunities or target new customers in areas that may overlap with those that we have chosen to pursue. In such cases, we may potentially compete
against our partners. Competition from our partners may adversely affect our relationships with our partners and our business. In addition, some of the
terms of our partner relationships include exclusivity or other restrictive clauses that limit our ability to partner with or provide services to potential other
customers or third parties, which could harm our business. We may in the future enter into agreements with customers that restrict our ability to accept
assignments from, or render similar services to, those customers’ customers, require us to obtain our customers’ prior written consent to provide services
to their customers or restrict our ability to compete with our customers, or bid for or accept any assignment for which those customers are bidding or
negotiating. These restrictions may hamper our ability to compete for and provide services to other customers in a specific industry in which we have
expertise and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
54
Table of Contents
New competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies,
greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our
competitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of our market, which could create additional price pressure. In light of these factors,
even if our solution is more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers may accept competitive solutions in lieu of purchasing
our solution. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
If our existing customers do not continue or renew their contracts with us, renew at lower fee levels or decline to license additional applications and
services from us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of existing customer contracts and sales of additional applications and
services to existing customers.
Customer renewals may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the breadth of early deployment of our solution, changes in
customers’ business models and use cases, our customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solution, our pricing or pricing structure, the pricing or
capabilities of products or services offered by our competitors, or the effects of economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their agreements
with us, or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline. If our customers are dissatisfied with our products, including, for example,
because members do not engage with our solutions, our customers may terminate or decline renewal of their contracts. In particular, our customers are
often motivated to partner with us because they believe that members’ use of our solutions will decrease their spending levels. If we are not successful in
engaging members through our platform and services, we may not meet our customers’ expectations. If we fail to satisfy our existing customers, they may
not renew their contracts, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
As part of our growth strategy we have recently focused on expanding our services amongst current customers. As a result, selling additional
applications and services are critical to our future business, revenue growth and results of operations. Factors that may affect our ability to sell additional
applications and services include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
the price, performance and functionality of our solutions;
•
the availability, price, performance and functionality of competing solutions;
•
our ability to develop and sell complementary applications and services;
•
the stability, performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services;
•
changes in healthcare and telemedicine laws, regulations or trends; and
•
the business environment of our customers and, in particular, headcount reductions by our customers.
We mainly enter into three types of contracts with our customers: value-based care, fee-for-service, and licensing. Under our fee-for-service
agreements, we get paid by our customers based on the number of services members use through our platform and/or based on the number of members
who can use our platform (i.e., eligible populations). Under our value-based care agreements with health plans, we generally receive a fixed fee per month
for healthcare services and assume the financial responsibility for the healthcare expenses of members. Under our licensing agreements, we license our
technology to third parties for them to make our technology available in certain territories and/or on their platforms. Our fee-for-service contracts
generally have initial terms of one to two years and our licensing and risk-based contracts generally have initial terms of two to ten years. Most of our
customers have no obligation to renew their contracts after the initial term expires. In addition, our customers may negotiate terms less advantageous to
us upon renewal, which may reduce our revenue from these customers. Our future results of operations also depend, in part, on our ability to expand our
service and product
55
Table of Contents
offering. If our customers fail to renew their contracts, renew their contracts upon less favorable terms or at lower fee levels, or fail to license new
products and services from us, our revenue may decline, or our future revenue growth may be constrained.
In addition, after the initial contract term, some of our customer contracts allow customers to terminate such agreements for convenience at certain
times, typically with one to three months advance notice. We typically incur the expenses associated with integrating a customer’s data into our
healthcare database and related training and support prior to recognizing meaningful revenue from such a customer. Subscription access revenue is not
recognized until our products are implemented for launch, which is generally a few months after contract signing. If a customer terminates its contract
early and revenue and cash flows expected from a customer are not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
In the United States and for elements of our business in the U.K., we are dependent on our relationships with physician-owned entities to hold
contracts and provide healthcare services We do not own such professional entities, and our business could be harmed if those relationships were
disrupted or if our arrangements with our providers or our customers are found to violate states laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine
or fee-splitting.
There is a risk that authorities in some jurisdictions may find that our contractual relationships with the physician-owned professional entities with
which we contract violate the corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting laws or similar or equivalent rules in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws
generally prohibit the practice of medicine by, or sharing of professional fees with, lay persons or entities and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons
or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing a clinician’s professional judgment. The extent to which each state considers particular
actions or contractual relationships to constitute improper influence of professional judgment or fee-splitting varies across the states and is subject to
change and to evolving interpretations by state boards of medicine, state courts and state attorneys general, among others. As such, we must monitor
our compliance with laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate on an ongoing basis and we cannot guarantee that subsequent interpretation of the
corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting laws will not circumscribe our business operations. The enforcement of state corporate practice of medicine
doctrines or fee-splitting laws may result in the imposition of penalties, including but not limited to, penalties on the physicians themselves for aiding the
corporate practice of medicine, which could discourage physicians from participating in our network of providers.
The corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case
law, in approximately 31 states. The broad variation between state application and enforcement of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine makes an
exact count difficult. We plan to conduct business in all of these states and are currently operating in most of them. Due to the prevalence of the
corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we predominantly conduct our business, we provide administrative and
management services to certain physician-owned professional entities pursuant to agreements under which those entities reserve exclusive control and
responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services. We contract with the vast majority of such physician-owned
entities through business support agreements and direct transfer agreements for the provision of health care services, the receipt of fees, and physician-
owner succession planning purposes. For professional entities with which we contract but with respect to which we have not implemented a direct share
transfer agreement, we implement other measures (e.g., option agreements) for similar succession planning purposes. For further discussion of this
structure, see “Babylon’s Business—Affiliated Physicians and Healthcare Professionals.” While we expect that these relationships will continue, we
cannot guarantee that they will. A material change in our relationship with these physician-owned entities, whether resulting from a dispute among the
entities, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliations, could impair our ability to provide services to our consumers and could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the arrangements in which we have entered to comply with state corporate practice of medicine doctrines could subject us to additional
scrutiny by federal and state regulatory bodies, including with respect to federal and state fraud and abuse laws. We believe that our operations comply
with applicable state statutes and regulations regarding corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, and anti-kickback prohibitions. However, any
scrutiny, investigation, or litigation with regard to our arrangement with physician-owned entities could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements to comply with applicable laws
or we are required to restructure at a significant cost, or if we were subject to penalties or other adverse action.
Our telemedicine business and growth strategy depend on our ability to maintain and expand a network of qualified providers. If we are unable to
do so, our future growth would be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.
Our success is dependent upon our continued ability to maintain an adequate network of qualified telemedicine providers. If we are unable to
recruit and retain board-certified physicians and other healthcare professionals, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to
grow and would adversely affect our results of operations. In any particular market, providers could demand higher payments or take other actions that
could result in higher medical costs, less attractive service for our customers or difficulty meeting applicable regulatory or accreditation requirements. Our
ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers also may be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as
changes in Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement levels and consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and healthcare providers, the
continued private equity investment in physician practice management platforms and other market and operating pressures on healthcare providers. In
the United Kingdom, reports of pressures in primary medical services are starting to emerge following the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a period of
cessation of some services in the NHS, as services resume, there is likely to be additional demand for services caused by delayed appointments,
presentations and investigations. The demand for appropriately qualified individuals to enable us to deliver services is also likely to increase, and similar
trends in the demand for, and constrained supply of, appropriately qualified medical professionals may also be experienced in the United States.
The failure to maintain or to secure new cost-effective provider contracts in the United States and to recruit qualified individuals in the United
Kingdom may result in a loss of or inability to grow our membership base, higher costs, healthcare provider network disruptions, less attractive service
for our customers and/or difficulty in meeting applicable regulatory requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to attract new customers and expand member enrollment with existing clinical services and Babylon 360 customers, our revenue
growth could be slower than we expect, and our business may be adversely affected.
We generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from market adoption of our digital health products. As a result, widespread acceptance
and use of digital health solutions in general, and our platform in particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the market fails to grow or
grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our solutions could be negatively affected.
Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract new customers. If we fail to
attract new customers and fail to maintain and expand new customer relationships, our revenue may grow more slowly than we expect, and our business
may be adversely affected. Demand for digital health solutions in general, and our solution in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of which
are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:
•
market adoption and ongoing usage of telemedicine solutions, in particular following the removal of various “stay at home” restrictions due
to the COVID-19 pandemic;
57
Table of Contents
•
awareness and adoption of technology in healthcare generally;
•
availability of products and services that compete with ours;
•
ease of adoption and use;
•
features and platform experience;
•
performance;
•
brand;
•
security and privacy; and
•
pricing.
In addition, our ability to increase engagement of the individual members that interact with our platform will affect our future revenue growth;
however, the effect that member engagement has on revenue growth depends on the type of agreement pursuant to which members engage with our
platform. For example, under our fee-for-service agreements, we get paid by our customers based on the number of services members use through our
platform and/or based on the number of members who can use our platform (i.e. eligible populations). Therefore, revenue growth under our fee-for-service
agreements depends in part on our ability to increase engagement with members so that they will use additional services. Under our value-based care
agreements with health plans, we generally receive a fixed fee per month for healthcare services and assume the financial responsibility for the healthcare
expenses of members. Under these value-based care agreements, we assume the financial responsibility of caring for members whether those members
use our services or not. Therefore, if members do not use our solutions and seek medical care from alternate sources, we may be unable to control the
costs and we may be contractually obligated to pay at least a portion of these unknown expenses, which could adversely affect our business and
operating results. Additionally, even if we are successful engaging members and those members use our services, we may not be able to control the costs
of healthcare in the ways that we are expecting and healthcare costs may be higher than we are anticipating. If healthcare costs through our platform are
higher than we are anticipating this could adversely affect our business and operating results.
A significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of customers, and the loss of a material contract could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, two, four, and three customers, respectively, represented 10% or more of our total revenue. For the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, our top ten customers accounted for 99%, 90% and 95% of our
revenue, respectively.
We also rely on our reputation and recommendations from key customers in order to promote our solution to potential new customers. The loss of
any of our key customers, or a failure of some of them to renew or expand their agreements, could have a significant impact on our revenue, our
reputation and our ability to obtain new customers. In addition, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers could lead to cancellation or non-
renewal of our contracts with those customers or by the acquiring or combining companies, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential
customers, and their member populations.
The recognition of a portion of our revenue is subject to the achievement of performance metrics and healthcare cost savings and may not be
representative of revenue for future periods.
While there are variations specific to each agreement, for our Babylon 360 arrangements, which operate pursuant to value-based care agreements,
we generally price our services based upon a per-member-per-month (“PMPM”) fee. We multiply this PMPM fee by the number of eligible members to
calculate our monthly run-rate
58
Table of Contents
revenue (“MRR”) for that agreement. Typically, a significant portion of the PMPM fee is fixed (we refer to this portion as the base PMPM fee), and the
remainder of the PMPM fee is variable (we refer to this portion as the variable PMPM fee). Revenue from variable PMPM fees can be earned through
either, or a combination of, the achievement of certain performance metrics or the realization of healthcare savings resulting from the utilization of our
services. Although we target achievement of these performance metrics and realization in savings of healthcare spend, our revenue and financial results
in the future may depend on whether we earn this performance-based revenue. In addition, since our customers typically pay the full PMPM fee in
advance on a periodic basis, any required refund as a result of our failure to earn the performance-based revenue could have a negative impact on cash
flows. Under some of our agreements with health plans, after conducting significant diligence and reviewing actuary and financial projections based on
the information that health plans (and, in England, the NHS) provide us that we ultimately do not have control over, we assume some or all of the risk that
our cost of providing services will exceed our compensation. While we generally price our services based upon a PMPM fee, in the future we may also
explore other structures, such as gain/loss share arrangements which set out an investment made by Babylon in relation to a defined segment of local
population, at risk, and how this will be recovered and “gains” or “losses” will be shared between Babylon and the counterparty when compared against
control population.
Under these arrangements, if members require more care than is anticipated and/or the cost of care increases, then the aggregate fixed
compensation amounts, or capitation payments, may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with treatment. If medical costs and expenses exceed
estimates, except in very limited circumstances, we will not be able to increase the fee received under these risk agreements during their then-current
terms and we could suffer losses with respect to such agreements.
Changes in our anticipated ratio of medical expense to revenue can significantly impact our financial results. Accordingly, the failure to adequately
predict and control medical costs and expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported claims,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the expenses of our members
may be outside of our control in the event that members take certain actions that increase such expenses, such as unnecessary hospital visits. We are
reliant on accurate information from reporting and health plans relating to historic and current data. Inaccuracies in such reporting could have a negative
impact on our financial position.
Due to the time lag between when services are actually rendered by providers and when we receive, process, and pay a claim for those services,
our medical expenses include a provision for claims incurred but not paid. We are continuously enhancing our process for estimating claims liability,
which we monitor and refine on a periodic basis as claims receipts, payment information, and inpatient acuity information become available. As more
complete information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimate, and include the changes in estimates in expenses in the period in which
the changes are identified. Given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates, there can be no assurance that our claims liability estimate will be adequate,
and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact, potentially in a material way, our reported results of operations and financial condition.
Further, our inability to estimate our claims liability with absolute certainty or to appropriately utilize the claims data to control the cost of future
healthcare services may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions, further exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on our results.
Historically, our medical costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue have fluctuated. Factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed
estimates include:
•
the health status of members and higher levels of hospitalization;
•
higher than expected utilization of new or existing healthcare services or technologies, including the level of engagement with Babylon’s
digital healthcare platform and tools;
•
an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise;
59
Table of Contents
•
changes to mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws, regulations and practices;
•
increased costs attributable to specialist physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers;
•
changes in the demographics of our members;
•
changes in medical trends;
•
contractual or claims disputes with providers, hospitals or other service providers within and outside a health plan’s network;
•
the occurrence of catastrophes, major epidemics or acts of terrorism; and
•
the reduction of health plan premiums.
Renegotiation, non-renewal or termination of value-based care agreements with health plans could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Under most of our value-based care agreements with health plans, the health plans are generally permitted to modify the respective benefits
available to members from time to time during the respective terms of the agreements and health plans may make other changes, such as to their utilization
review and coverage policies, that affect the cost of care to our attributed members. In addition, changes in government program funding, such as with
respect to Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage programs, can affect the revenue we receive from health plans under our value-based care
agreements. If there is an unanticipated change to a health plan’s benefits or coverage policies or to the government program funding, we could suffer
losses with respect to such contract. We include in many of our value-based care agreements mechanisms to protect against losses by allowing early
termination or amendment of the value-based care terms, but these may not protect against all adverse changes that are outside of Babylon’s control or
they may not prevent us from suffering losses with respect to such contract.
There are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenue that we recognize under our licensing agreements and value-based care
agreements with health plans, and if our estimates of revenue are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenue
recognition or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Babylon Holdings’ revenue projections are based on management’s expectation of executed contracts delivering revenue in line with contractual
terms and estimates relating to amounts received under our value-based care agreements. There are significant risks associated with estimating the
amount of revenue that we recognize under our licensing agreements and value-based care agreements with health plans in a reporting period.
Certain of our value-based care agreements relate to medical care programs that employ risk adjustment programs that impact the revenue we
recognize for our attributed membership. As a result of the variability of certain factors that go into the development of the risk adjustment revenue we
recognize, such as risk scores and other market-level factors where applicable, the actual amount of revenue could be materially more or less than our
estimates. In the United States, the data provided to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to determine the risk score are subject to
audit by CMS even several years after the annual settlements occur. If the risk adjustment data we submit are found to overstate the health status of our
members, we may be required to refund payments previously received by us and/or be subject to penalties or sanctions, including potential liability under
the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), which can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment,
loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition to paybacks and civil penalties reducing our revenue in
the year that repayment or settlement is required, Medicare and Medicaid programs represent a large portion of our revenue in the United States and
exclusion from future participation in these programs would significantly reduce our revenue for years to come. Further, if the data we provide to CMS
understates the health risk of our members,
60
Table of Contents
we might be underpaid for the care that we must provide to our members. Consequently, our estimate of our health plans’ risk scores for any period, and
any resulting change in our accrual of revenues related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. Some revenue risk is transferred via stop-loss policies insuring against catastrophic claims that cover most of our value-based
care arrangements. Similar risks apply in the U.K., including England. Gain/loss sharing with the NHS is predicated on data which is extracted and
controlled by the NHS. While provisions are made to access and review this data it may not be possible to effectively challenge this.
The billing and collection process in the United States can be complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage
differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage and other payer issues, such as ensuring appropriate documentation. Determining applicable
primary and secondary coverage for our members, together with the changes in member coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-
intensive processes. While we manage the overall processing of some claims, we rely on third-party billing provider software to transmit the actual claims
to payers based on the specific payer billing format. The potential therefore exists for us to experience delays or errors in claims processing when third-
party providers make changes to their configurations and/or invoicing systems. If claims are not submitted to payers on a timely basis or are erroneously
submitted, or if we are required to switch to a different software provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process
these claims and receipt of payments from payers, or possibly denial of claims for lack of timely submission, which would have an adverse effect on our
revenue and our business. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payers. Revenues associated with these
medical care programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary payer that will ultimately be collectible from other
payers paying secondary coverage, the member’s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the member. Collections, refunds and payer retractions
typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. If our estimates of revenues are materially inaccurate, it could
impact the timing and the amount of our revenue recognition and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.
We may be required to delay recognition of some of our revenue, which may harm our financial results in any given period.
We may be required to delay recognition of revenue for a significant period of time if, in relation to any agreement we enter into:
•
the transaction involves both current products and products that are under development;
•
the customer requires significant modifications, configurations, or complex interfaces that could delay delivery or acceptance of our
solution;
•
we are unable to demonstrate adequate control of the care management services being provided to our customers due to regulatory
requirements or other contractual provisions;
•
the transaction involves acceptance criteria or other terms that may delay revenue recognition; or
•
the transaction involves payment terms that depend upon contingencies.
Because of these factors and other specific revenue recognition requirements under IFRS, we must have very precise terms in our contracts to
begin recognizing revenue at the time when we initially provide access to our platform or provide care management services to our customers. Although
we strive to enter into agreements that meet the criteria under IFRS for current revenue recognition on delivered performance obligations, our agreements
are often subject to negotiation and revisions based on the demands of our customers. The final terms of our agreements sometimes result in deferred
revenue recognition or an inability to recognize revenue on a gross basis, which may adversely affect our financial results in any given period.

Our sales and implementation cycle can be long and unpredictable and requires considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue
are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.
The timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle. The
sales cycle for our solution from initial contact with a potential customer to enrollment launch varies widely by customer, ranging from less than one
month to over a year. Some of our customers, especially in the case of our large customers and government entities, undertake a significant and
prolonged evaluation process, including to determine whether our solutions meet their unique healthcare needs, which frequently involves evaluation of
not only our solution but also of other available solutions, which has in the past resulted in extended sales cycles. Our sales efforts involve educating
our customers about the ease of use, technical capabilities and potential benefits of our solution. Once a customer enters into an agreement with us, we
then explain the benefits of our solutions again to eligible employees to encourage them to sign up as a member. During the sales cycle, we invest
significant human resources and we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities, which lowers our operating margins, particularly
if no sale occurs. For example, there may be unexpected delays in a customer’s internal procurement processes, particularly for some of our larger
customers and government entities for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity. There are many other
factors specific to customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition, including the strategic
importance of a particular project to a customer, budgetary constraints, funding authorization, and changes in their personnel. In addition, the
significance and timing of our product enhancements, and the introduction of new products by our competitors, may also affect our customers’
purchases. Even if a customer decides to purchase our solutions, there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue, which makes
our revenue difficult to forecast. For example, once a customer enters into an agreement with us, we work with them to identify the eligible population and
then launch an enrollment process. Time from signing to launch typically takes an average of at least three to six months. We do not receive any payment
from our customers until members enroll and begin using our solution, which could be months following signing a subscription agreement for our
solution. For all of these reasons, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the
period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized.
It is possible that in the future we may experience even longer sales cycles, more complex customer needs, higher upfront sales costs and less
predictability in completing some of our sales as we continue to expand our direct sales force, expand into new territories and market additional solutions
and services. If our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront sales and implementation investments do not result in sufficient sales to justify our
investments, our revenue could be lower than expected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Our records and submissions to a health plan may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of members,
which could cause us to overstate or understate our revenue and subject us to various penalties or repayment obligations.
The claims and encounter records that we submit to health plans may impact data that support the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”),
scores attributable to members. These RAF scores determine, in part, the revenue to which the health plans and, in turn, we are entitled to receive for the
provision of medical care to such members. The data submitted to CMS by each health plan is based, in part, on medical charts and diagnosis codes that
we prepare and submit to the health plans. Each health plan generally relies on us and our affiliated physicians to appropriately document and support
such RAF data in our medical records. Each health plan also relies on us and our affiliated physicians to appropriately code claims for medical services
provided to members. Erroneous claims and erroneous encounter records and submissions could result in inaccurate revenue and risk adjustment
payments, which may be subject to correction or retroactive adjustment in later periods. This corrected or adjusted information may be reflected in
financial statements for periods subsequent to the period in which the revenue was recorded. We might also need to refund a portion of the revenue that
we received, which
62
Table of Contents
refund, depending on its magnitude, could damage our relationship with the applicable health plan and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Additionally, CMS and the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (“HHS”) each audit Medicare
Advantage (“MA”), plans for documentation to support RAF-related payments for members chosen at random. The MA plans ask providers to submit
the underlying documentation for members that they serve. It is possible that claims associated with members with higher RAF scores could be subject to
more scrutiny in a CMS, OIG, or plan audit. There is a possibility that a MA plan may seek repayment from us should CMS make any payment
adjustments to the MA plan as a result of its or OIG’s audits. The plans also may hold us liable for any penalties owed to CMS for inaccurate or
unsupportable RAF scores provided by us or our affiliated physicians. In addition, we could be liable for penalties to the government under the FCA that
currently range from $11,665 to $23,331 (but which may be adjusted in the future for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of
damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim.
On June 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties (statutorily limited to between $5,000 and
$10,000, as adjusted for inflation), under which the per claim range increases to a range from $11,665 to $23,331 per claim, so long as the underlying
conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.
CMS has indicated that payment adjustments from its Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits will not be limited to RAF scores for the specific MA
enrollees for which errors are found but may also be extrapolated to the entire MA plan subject to a particular CMS contract. CMS has described its audit
process as plan-year specific and stated that it will not extrapolate audit results for plan years prior to 2011. Because CMS has not stated otherwise, there
is a risk that payment adjustments made as a result of one plan year’s audit would be extrapolated to prior plan years after 2011.
There can be no assurance that a health plan will not be randomly selected or targeted for review by CMS or OIG or that the outcome of such a
review will not result in a material adjustment in our revenue and profitability, even if the information we submitted to the plan is accurate and
supportable.
If reimbursement rates paid by third-party payers or federal or state healthcare programs are reduced or if third-party payers or government payers
otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to our members, our business could be harmed.
Private third-party payers and government healthcare programs pay for the services that we provide to many of our members. If any commercial
third-party payers reduce their reimbursement rates or elect not to cover some or all of our services, our business may be harmed. Third-party payers also
are entering into sole source contracts with some healthcare providers, which could effectively limit our pool of potential members.
Private third-party payers often use plan structures, such as narrow networks or tiered networks, to encourage or require their members to lower
their costs. Private third-party payers generally attempt to limit their members’ use of out-of-network providers by imposing higher copayment and/or
deductible amounts for out-of-network care than for in-network care. Additionally, private third-party payers have become increasingly aggressive in
attempting to minimize the use of out-of-network providers by disregarding the assignment of payment from members to out-of-network providers (i.e.,
sending payments directly to members instead of to out-of-network providers), capping out-of-network benefits payable to members, waiving out-of-
pocket payment amounts and initiating litigation against out-of-network providers for interference with contractual relationships, insurance fraud and
violation of state licensing and consumer protection laws. If we become out of network for private third-party payers, our business could be harmed and
our member service revenue could be reduced because members could stop using our services.
In addition, a portion of our revenue comes from services provided to beneficiaries of federal, state and local government healthcare programs,
principally Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
63
Table of Contents
Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and
determinations, requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions, each of which could increase or decrease program payments,
as well as affect the cost of providing service to members and the timing of payments to our physician-owned networks. We are unable to predict the
effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments
as a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding COVID-19 relief legislation, may affect the availability of
taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in government healthcare programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could
adversely impact our business and results of operations.
As federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase, and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls, federal and state
governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These changes include reductions in
reimbursement levels and to new or modified demonstration projects authorized pursuant to Medicaid waivers. Some of these changes have decreased, or
could decrease, the amount of money we receive for our services relating to these programs. In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or
portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government healthcare programs that reduce payments under these
programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.
In addition, in the U.K. (including England), primary medical services delivered under general medical services contracts are paid for in accordance
with the General Medical Services Statement of Financial Entitlements, which is subject to change over time. While we consider it unlikely that the
amount paid will decrease overall, as it is subject to negotiation with general practitioner representative bodies, there is nonetheless a risk that
reimbursement of property costs for primary care service delivery may decrease or cease over time. We currently do not receive reimbursement of
property costs related to Babylon GP at Hand services, our primary medical services platform in the United Kingdom; however, work is ongoing to
property costs related to Babylon GP at Hand services, our primary medical services platform in the United Kingdom; however, work is ongoing to
establish whether this is possible.
The market for telemedicine is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop, if it develops more slowly than we expect, if it encounters negative
publicity or if our solutions do not drive member engagement, the growth of our business will be harmed.
The telemedicine market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand, consumer
acceptance and market adoption. The COVID-19 pandemic increased acceptance and utilization of telemedicine services, but it is uncertain whether such
increase in demand will continue. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of our members to use, and to increase the frequency
and extent of their utilization of, our solution, as well as on our ability to demonstrate the value of telemedicine to employers, health plans, government
agencies and other purchasers of healthcare for beneficiaries. Negative publicity concerning our solution, other participants in the telemedicine market, or
the telemedicine market as a whole could limit market acceptance of our solution. If our customers and members do not perceive the benefits of our
telemedicine solution, or if our telemedicine solution does not drive member engagement, then our market may not develop at all, or it may develop more
slowly than we expect. Similarly, individual and healthcare industry concerns or negative publicity regarding patient confidentiality and privacy in the
context of telemedicine could limit market acceptance of our healthcare services. If any of these events occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we are not able to develop and release new solutions and services, or successful enhancements, new features and modifications to our existing
solutions and services, our business could be adversely affected.
Our products are based on novel technologies that are rapidly evolving. Our algorithms and other technologies depend on our ability to continue
to build a substantial repository of health-related data and validate additional product designs. Given the rapidly evolving changing nature of our
products, there is no guarantee that
64
Table of Contents
we have fully understood all the implications of using such technologies alongside the traditional delivery of healthcare. In addition, we must execute on
our strategy to build a significant repository of health-related data to support the robustness and accuracy of our technologies and allow us to develop
additional artificial intelligence-enabled applications. We believe that access to contemporary and historical member data, combined with the ability to
analytically and clinically validate study results in a quality-controlled framework, provides us with a robust, reproducible method for product
development. Moreover, the depth, specificity and quality of data are of paramount importance to further developing novel solutions that can
demonstrate clinical utility across a range of practice specialties and member demographics. These features are also central to our product strategy of
demonstrating both short- and long-term impact on member outcomes and health economics. If we are unable to continue to build our data repository, we
may not be able to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology and improve the capabilities and utility of our products, and our business could be
harmed.
The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and
enhancements, changing customer demands, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies
can quickly make existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations could impact the usefulness
of our solution and could necessitate changes or modifications to our solution to accommodate such changes. For example, the European Commission’
recently announced proposal for a European Union (“EU”) Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (which would have extraterritorial effect outside of the
EU), could lead to enhanced requirements as to the accuracy, robustness and security of so-called “high risk” AI systems used in healthcare settings. We
invest substantial resources in researching and developing new solutions and enhancing our solutions by incorporating additional features, improving
functionality, and adding other improvements to meet our customers’ and members’ evolving demands. The success of any enhancements or
improvements to our solutions or any new solutions depends on several factors, including timely completion, competitive pricing, adequate quality
testing, integration with new and existing technologies in our solutions and third-party partners’ technologies, effective and compliant localization for
jurisdictions in which we operate and overall market acceptance. We may not succeed in developing, marketing and delivering on a timely and cost-
effective basis enhancements or improvements to our solutions or any new solutions that respond to continued changes in market demands or new
customer requirements. Further, any enhancements or improvements to our solutions or any new solutions may not achieve market acceptance. Since
developing our solutions is complex, the timetable for the release of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions is difficult to predict, and we
may not offer new solutions and updates as rapidly as our customers require or expect. Any new solutions that we develop may not be introduced in a
timely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue.
Moreover, even if we introduce new solutions, we may experience a decline in revenue of our existing solutions that is not offset by revenue from the new
solutions. For example, customers may delay making purchases of new solutions to permit them to make a more thorough evaluation of these solutions or
until industry and marketplace reviews become widely available. Some customers may hesitate to migrate to a new solution due to concerns regarding the
performance of the new solution. In addition, we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor’s products and services. This could result in a
temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and adversely affect our business.
The introduction of new products and solutions by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies within the digital health market
which could serve to replace existing offerings could make our solutions obsolete or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We may experience difficulties with software development, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or
implementation of additional features or capabilities. In addition, there may be other delays or barriers to introducing new products or features relating to
regulation. If customers and members do not widely purchase and adopt our solutions, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we do
not accurately anticipate customer and member demand, if we are unable to develop, license or acquire new features and capabilities on a timely and cost-
effective basis, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, we may encounter adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance or
claims by customers or
65

members brought against us. Each of these possible effects could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and
results of operations.
We expect to continue to dedicate significant financial and other resources to our research and development efforts in order to continuously
evolve the development of our products and maintain our competitive position. As a result, our business is significantly dependent on our ability to
successfully complete the development of our next generation products. Investing in research and development personnel, developing new products and
enhancing existing products is expensive and time consuming, and there is no assurance that such activities will result in successful development of our
products, significant new marketable products or enhancements to our products, design improvements, cost savings, revenues or other expected
benefits. If we spend significant time and effort on research and development and are unable to generate an adequate return on our investment, our
business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Our proprietary solutions may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our
resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The development of proprietary technology is time-consuming, expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter
technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems or design defects that prevent our proprietary solutions from operating
properly. If our solutions do not function reliably, malfunction, or fail to achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert
liability claims against us or attempt to terminate their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain
customers.
The software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be
discovered after the solution has been used by our members. Any real or perceived errors, failures, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our
solution could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation. It could also result in loss of customers, loss of members, loss of or delay in
market acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position, loss of revenue or liability for damages, overpayments and/or underpayments, any of
which could harm our enrollment rates. In such an event, we may be required or may choose to expend additional resources in order to help correct the
problem. Such efforts could be costly, or ultimately unsuccessful. Even if we are successful at remediating issues, we may experience irreversible damage
to our reputation and brand. There can be no assurance that provisions typically included in our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our
exposure to claims would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Even if
unsuccessful, a claim brought against us by any customers would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend and could seriously damage our
reputation and brand.
If our products do not effectively interoperate with our customers’ existing and future infrastructures, installations could be delayed or cancelled,
which would harm our business.
Our products must effectively interoperate with our customers’ existing or future IT or application infrastructures, which often have different
specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors and contain multiple generations of products that have been
added over time. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ infrastructure or problematic network
configurations or settings, we may have to modify our software so that our products will interoperate with our customers’ infrastructure and business
processes. In addition, to stay competitive within certain markets, we may be required to make software modifications in future releases to comply with
new statutory or regulatory requirements. Further, in order to move into new markets and serve new customers globally, we may be required to modify our
existing software in order to comply with existing statutory or regulatory regimes that exist in those markets. These issues could result in additional time
and expenditure to modify our offering, longer sales cycles for our products and order cancellations, all of which would adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risk of your
investment.
Our relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and plan for our future growth. All of our
growth has occurred in recent years. Babylon Holdings was formed in 2013, in 2014 became the first large-scale provider to be registered with the Care
Quality Commission (“CQC”), the independent regulator of health and social care in England, and in 2015 began providing clinical services through our
virtual care platform offering diagnosis, advice and treatments via medical professionals to members on a remote basis. We first provided NHS services
using the Babylon GP at Hand risk-based model in the United Kingdom in 2017, and we entered into our first value-based care agreements with health
plans in the United States in 2020. As such, we have limited experience providing services and managing contracts centered around a value-based care
model, especially in the United States.
We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, significant risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by new and growing companies in
rapidly changing industries. These include determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market adoption of our existing and future
solutions, competition from other companies, acquiring and retaining customers, managing customer deployments, overseeing member enrollment, hiring,
integrating, training and retaining skilled personnel, developing new solutions, determining prices for our solutions, unforeseen expenses, and challenges
in forecasting accuracy. If we have difficulty launching new solutions or increasing member enrollment, our revenue and our ability to achieve and
sustain profitability would be impaired. Additional risks include our ability to effectively manage growth and process, store, protect and use personal
data in compliance with governmental regulation, contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security globally. If our
assumptions regarding these and other similar risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change as we gain more
experience operating our business or due to changes in our industry, or if we do not address these challenges successfully, our operating and financial
results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.
We depend on our talent to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, integrate, develop, motivate and retain our personnel, we
may not be able to grow effectively.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management in sales, services, engineering, marketing,
operations, finance and support functions, especially in the London metropolitan area and in the United States, including in the Bay Area, where we
recently expanded our operations. For year ended December 31, 2020, we increased our global headcount of all employment types to 2,089 employees and
1678 full time employees globally. As of September 6, our global headcounts of all employment types and full time employees were 2,189 and 1,864
employees, respectively. Competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry, and the loss of even a few qualified employees, or an inability to
attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business could harm our operating results and
impair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program for key executive officers
and other employees and a discretionary bonus scheme for the general employee population. These measures may not be enough to attract and retain the
personnel we require to operate our business effectively.
The technology industry generally experiences a significant rate of turnover of its workforce. There is a limited pool of individuals who have the
skills and training needed to help us grow our company. As we continue to grow, we may be unable to continue to attract or retain the personnel we need
to maintain our competitive position. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining our best talent. Competition for these
resources, particularly for engineers, is intense. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new and existing
employees and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are not able to effectively increase and retain our talent, our ability to achieve our
strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will be harmed. The loss of one or more of our key
67
Table of Contents
employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for those key employees, could seriously harm our business.
Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares of our capital stock they own or the shares of our capital stock underlying their equity incentive
awards have significantly reduced in value or the vested shares of our capital stock they own or vested shares of our capital stock underlying their
equity incentive awards have significantly appreciated.
In addition, our future depends on the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel, each of whom would be
difficult to replace. In particular, Dr. Ali Parsadoust, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. We rely
on our leadership team in the areas of operations, research and development, marketing, sales, and general and administrative functions. Although we
have entered into employment agreements or offer letters with our key employees, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will
employment, and we do not maintain key person life insurance for some of our key employees. We are only entitled to one or three months’ prior notice if
Dr. Ali Parsadoust or Charlie Steel, our Chief Financial Officer, respectively, intend to terminate their employment with us and two to four weeks’ prior
notice if any of our other senior executives intend to terminate their respective employment with us. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes
in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior management team, including any new hires that we may make, fail to
work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
harmed. Further, if our Founder were to terminate his employment or be terminated for cause, he would retain voting control of our company following his
separation.
While we do include post-termination restrictions in our standard employment contracts and cross-train employees where possible to maintain
operational knowledge and experience, if any of our senior management team or key employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may
lose customers, suppliers, know-how and staff members to them. In addition, if any of our sales executives or other sales personnel, who generally
maintain close relationships with our customers, joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers to that company, and our
revenue may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge, business practices
or procedures by such personnel. Any non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key
employees might not provide effective protection to us in light of legal uncertainties associated with the enforceability of such agreements.
Our profitability and the cost of providing our services are affected by our utilization rates of our employees in our various locations. If we are not
able to maintain appropriate utilization rates for our employees involved in the delivery of our services, our profit margin and our profitability may suffer.
Our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:
•
our ability to promptly transition our employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and integrate new employees;
•
our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate number of employees in each of our delivery locations;
•
our ability to deploy employees with appropriate skills and seniority to projects;
•
our ability to manage the attrition of our employees; and
•
our need to devote time and resources to training, professional development and other activities that cannot be billed to our customers.
Our revenue could also suffer if we misjudge demand patterns and do not recruit sufficient employees to satisfy demand. Employee shortages
could prevent us from completing our contractual commitments in a timely manner and cause us to lose contracts or customers. Further, to the extent that
we lack sufficient employees with lower levels of seniority and daily or hourly rates, we may be required to deploy more senior employees with higher
rates on projects without the ability to pass such higher rates along to our customers, which could adversely affect our profit margin and profitability.

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our ordinary shares.
Our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, net loss and cash flows, has varied and may vary significantly in the future, and period-
to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our quarterly results may not fully reflect the underlying
performance of our business and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result
of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, the following:
•
the addition or loss of customers;
•
customer renewal rates and the timing and terms of customer renewals;
•
changes in our sales and implementation cycles, especially in the case of our large customers;
•
changes in our pricing or fee policies or those of our competitors;
•
the timing of recognition of revenue;
•
our ability to successfully expand our business, whether domestically or internationally, and to introduce new services and solutions;
•
the amount and timing of operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and
infrastructure, including upfront capital expenditures and other costs related to expanding in existing markets or entering new markets, as
well as providing administrative and operational services to our physician owned entity partners;
•
network or service outages, internet disruptions, the availability of our platforms, security breaches or perceived security breaches;
•
our ability to effectively manage the size and composition of our network of healthcare professionals relative to the level of demand for
services from our customers’ members and patients;
•
changes in our business strategies and pricing policies (or those of our competitors);
•
the timing and success of our entry into new markets or introductions of new or enhanced platforms or solutions by us or our competitors,
including disruptive technology, or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation or new entrants
among competitors, market participants or strategic alliances;
•
new, or changes to existing, regulations that limit or affect our platforms, solutions and technologies or which increase our regulatory
compliance costs, including with respect to privacy or data protection,;
•
the cost and potential outcomes of ongoing or future regulatory investigations or examinations, or enforcement by government regulators,
including fines, orders or consent decrees, or of future litigation;
•
general economic, political, social, industry and market conditions;
•
duration and severity of pandemics, epidemics, contageious diseases, flu and the like; and
•
the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment
of goodwill from acquired companies.
Most of our revenue in any given quarter is derived from contracts entered into with our customers during previous quarters. Consequently, a
decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such declines, however, would
negatively affect our revenue in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales of and market demand for our solution, and potential
changes in our rate of renewals or renewal terms, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our licensing model also
makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenue through additional sales in any
69
Table of Contents
period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the contract. Accordingly, the effect of changes in the industry
impacting our business or changes we experience in our new sales may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations. Any fluctuation in our
quarterly results may not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our ordinary
shares.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with our international
operations.
We have employees located in the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore and Rwanda. Our platform is available in the United States, United
Kingdom, Africa, 11 territories in Southeast Asia, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. We may further expand our international operations in the future. We have
invested significant resources in our international operations and expect to continue to do so in the future. An important part of targeting international
markets is increasing our brand awareness and establishing relationships with customers internationally. However, there are certain risks inherent in
doing business in international markets, particularly in the healthcare industry, which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions. These risks include:
•
local economic, political and social conditions, including the possibility of economic slowdowns, hyperinflationary conditions, political
instability, social unrest or outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as Ebola, Zika, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS), H1N1 (swine flu), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS);
•
multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, export and
import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;
•
obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances where required for the sale of our solution and services in various countries;
•
requirements to maintain data and the processing of that data on servers located within the United States or in other such countries we may
operate in;
•
protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights;
•
complexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers;
•
competition from companies with significant market share in our market, with greater resources than we have and with a better
understanding of user preferences;
•
financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the effect of local and regional financial pressures
on demand and payment for our products and services and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
•
the inability to manage and coordinate the various legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving
and subject to change;
•
actual or threatened trade war, including between the United States and China, or other governmental action related to tariffs, international
trade agreements or trade policies;
•
currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in currency policies or practices and restrictions on currency conversion;
•
limitations or restrictions on the repatriation or other transfer of funds;
•
the inability to enforce agreements, collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with differing commercial laws;
•
natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of
trade, and other market restrictions; and
70
Table of Contents
•
managing the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations,
including anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment
by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity was subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our
ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy.
Our overall success and ability to continue to expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks
and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so without incurring unexpected or increased costs. If we are not able to manage the risks related
to our international operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In certain regions, the
degree of these risks may be higher due to more volatile economic, political or social conditions, less developed and predictable legal and regulatory
regimes and increased potential for various types of adverse governmental action. Our ability to continue to expand our business and to attract talented
employees, customers and members in various international markets will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the
particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business. Entering new international markets is expensive, our ability to successfully gain market
acceptance or establish a robust customer base in any particular market is uncertain. Further, the potential distraction this could cause our senior
management team could lead to other areas of our operations being neglected and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Economic uncertainty or downturns, particularly as it impacts particular industries, could adversely affect our business and operating results.
In recent years, the United States, the United Kingdom and other significant markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic
conditions remain uncertain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic uncertainty, political uncertainty, including as a result of the
United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, or Brexit, and the associated macroeconomic and employment conditions and national and local
government responses thereto make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could
cause our customers to slow spending on our solution, which could delay and lengthen sales cycles. In connection with Brexit, changes to health
legislation have been proposed. While we believe that many of the proposed changes are likely to have taken place regardless of Brexit, some changes,
including to procurement law, may be impacted more widely than otherwise. Furthermore, during uncertain economic times our customers may face issues
gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may
be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts or bad debts and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. In particular, legal,
political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit may be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations,
adversely affect our operations in the United Kingdom and pose additional risks to our business, revenue, financial conditions, and results of operations.
Additionally, changes to health legislation are proposed and, while much of this is likely to have taken place regardless of Brexit, some changes, including
to procurement law, may be impacted more widely than otherwise.
Furthermore, we have customers in a variety of different industries. A significant downturn in the economic activity attributable to any particular
industry may cause organizations to react by reducing their capital and operating expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on
healthcare matters. In addition, our customers may delay or cancel healthcare projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. To
the extent purchases of our solution are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately
affected by delays or reductions in general healthcare spending. Also, competitors, especially those who have more significant resources or additional
sector offerings
71
Table of Contents
than we do, may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Congress, CMS and other federal agencies with oversight of care delivery requirements
made several changes in the manner in which Medicare will pay for telemedicine visits, many of which relax previous requirements, including site
requirements for both the providers and members, telemedicine modality requirements and others. State laws and regulations applicable to telemedicine,
particularly licensure requirements, also were relaxed in many jurisdictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These relaxed regulations have allowed
us to continue operating our business and delivering care to our members predominantly through telemedicine modalities. Nearly all of the Federal
measures will expire at the end of the Public Health Emergency declaration, which the Biden administration has indicated will last through the end of 2021.
Many State law and regulatory changes have already expired while others have continued. It is unclear which, if any, of these changes will remain in place
permanently and which will be rolled-back following the COVID-19 pandemic, although there have been a number of state law and regulatory changes
over the past year that clarify requirements or remove impediments. If regulations change to restrict our ability to or prohibit us from delivering care or
receiving reimbursement for care delivered through telemedicine modalities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
In England, reports of pressures in primary services are starting to emerge following the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a period of cessation of some
services in the NHS and a restart, there is likely to be additional demand for NHS services caused by delayed appointments, delayed presentations,
investigations. This could result in an increased demand for U.K. non-NHS services, which could result in Babylon GP at Hand experiencing cost
pressures.
We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or any industry in particular.
If the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.
Failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.
We believe that our future growth will depend on the continued development of our direct sales force and its ability to obtain new customers and
to manage our existing customer base. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. It
can take some time from their initial date of hire before a new sales representative is fully trained and productive. Additionally, if we cannot retain
members of our direct sales force then this will impact our business adversely, given we will lose trained members and have to spend a corresponding
amount of time on hiring and training replacements. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train our direct sales force do not
generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain sufficient numbers of productive direct sales
personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, sales of our services will suffer
and our growth will be impeded.
We may make investments into or acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result in dilution to our
shareholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty integrating any such acquisitions successfully or realizing the
anticipated benefits therefrom, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We made investments in Health Innovators Inc. (d/b/a DayToDay) (“DayToDay”) in 2019 and Higi in 2020, and our affiliates acquired the assets of
First Choice Medical Group in 2020 and the entire issued share capital of the Meritage Medical Network. In the future, we may seek to acquire or invest in
businesses, applications, services, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our existing and future offerings, enhance our technical
capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur
various expenses in identifying, investigating, and
72
Table of Contents
pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and may have
difficulty integrating acquired businesses or assets, or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. If we acquire additional
businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business
following the acquisition. Integration may prove to be difficult due to the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds,
different geographical locations and who may be accustomed to different corporate cultures.
We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any acquired business due to a number of factors, including:
•
inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;
•
unanticipated costs or liabilities, including legal liabilities, associated with the acquisition;
•
difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;
•
difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business into our current and future offerings and contract terms, including disparities
in the revenue model of the acquired company;
•
diversion of management’s attention or resources from other business concerns;
•
adverse effects on our existing business relationships with customers, members, or strategic partners as a result of the acquisition;
•
complexities associated with managing the geographic separation of the combined businesses and consolidating multiple physical
locations;
•
the potential loss of key employees;
•
acquisition targets not having as robust internal controls over financial reporting as would be expected of a public company;
•
us becoming subject to new regulations as a result of an acquisition, including if we acquire a business serving customers in a regulated
industry or acquire a business with customers or operations in a country in which we do not already operate;
•
possible cash flow interruption or loss of revenue as a result of transitional matters; and
•
use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.
We may issue equity securities or incur indebtedness to pay for any such acquisition or investment, which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause shareholders to experience significant dilution of
their ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares to decline.
In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to
take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
We may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third-parties that may not result
in the development of commercially viable solutions or the generation of significant future revenues.
In the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnerships
or other arrangements to provide our services develop products and to pursue new markets. Proposing, negotiating and implementing collaborations, in-
licensing arrangements, joint
73
Table of Contents
ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial,
marketing, sales, technology or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. We may not identify, secure, or
complete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms or at all. We have limited institutional
knowledge and experience with respect to these business development activities, and we may also not realize the anticipated benefits of any such
transaction or arrangement. In particular, these collaborations may not result in the development of products or services that achieve commercial success
or result in significant revenues and could be terminated prior to developing any products. Additionally, while as a matter of good practice, we prioritize
commercially appropriate ownership and licensing of intellectual property rights, contractual negotiations may result in us not owning, or jointly owning
with a third party, the intellectual property rights in products and other works developed under our collaborations, joint ventures, strategic alliances or
partnerships.
Additionally, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the transaction or arrangement, which could create
the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our future collaborators may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may
become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals. It is possible that conflicts may arise with our collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the
achievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations or
the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any future collaborators, they may act in
their self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interest, and they may breach their obligations to us. In addition, we may have limited control over
the amount and timing of resources that any future collaborators devote to our or their future products. Disputes between us and our collaborators may
result in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management. Further, these transactions and
arrangements will be contractual in nature and will generally be terminable under the terms of the applicable agreements and, in such event, we may not
continue to have rights to the products or services resulting from such transaction or arrangement or may need to purchase such rights at a premium.
Additionally, as would be standard for collaborations of such nature, we may have indemnity obligations in respect of, amongst other things, intellectual
property and data privacy obligations, which, if triggered, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are currently party to, and may enter into future, in-bound intellectual property license agreements. We may not be able to fully protect the
intellectual property licensed to us or maintain those licenses. Our licensors may retain the right to prosecute, enforce and defend the intellectual
property rights licensed to us, in which case we would depend on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property
protection for the licensed intellectual property. These licensors may determine not to enforce the licensed intellectual property against other companies
or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. In addition, such licenses may only provide us with non-exclusive rights, which could
allow other third parties, including our competitors, to utilize the licensed intellectual property rights. Further, our in-bound license agreements may
impose various diligence, commercialization, payment or other obligations on us. Our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement
with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license, which could adversely affect our freedom to operation or our competitive business position and
harm our business prospects.
Our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.
We use open source software in connection with our existing and future offerings. Some of these licenses may contain requirements that we make
available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or
derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third-parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of
certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available
under open source licenses, if we combine and/or distribute our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. Although we have a
policy on how open source software
74

may be used in our offering, and we monitor our use of open source software, we cannot be sure that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in
our proprietary software, that our programmers have not incorporated into our proprietary software open source software subject to such unfavorable
license terms, or that they will not do so in the future. Additionally, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been
interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. There is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated
conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our existing and future offerings to our customers and members. In addition, the terms of open source
software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such open source software, to others, including our competitors, on
unfavorable license terms. As a result of our current or future use of open source software, we may face claims or litigation, be required to release our
proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our technology, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be
accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could harm our
business.
Our business could be disrupted by catastrophic events and man-made problems, such as power disruptions, data security breaches and incidents,
and terrorism.
Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from the occurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, or
other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunction, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or incident of mass
violence, which could result in lengthy interruptions in access to our platform. Acts of terrorism, including malicious internet-based activity, could cause
disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, access to our platform could be interrupted. If our
systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to deliver our platform and solution to our
customers and members would be impaired or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to successfully execute on our disaster recovery and business
continuity plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed.
We have implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery program designed to effectively manage business interruption and continually
evolving. Specifically, our architecture is designed in availability zones to enable continuity when one or more zones is disrupted by moving traffic in the
event of a problem, and the ability to recover in a short period of time. However, should our disaster recovery program fail to effectively support the
movement of traffic in a timely or complete manner in the event of a catastrophe, our business and results of operations may be harmed.
We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to
our business, financial condition and results of operations that may result from interruptions in access to our platform as a result of system failures.
A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States, the United Kingdom or worldwide, including the outbreak of the
novel strain of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, could adversely affect our business.
If a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease occurs in the United States, the United Kingdom or worldwide, our business may be
adversely affected. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain and rapidly changing. As of the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition remains
uncertain. Furthermore, because of our business model, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations
and overall financial condition until future periods.
Adverse market conditions resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially adversely affect our business and the value of our ordinary
shares. Numerous state and local jurisdictions, including all markets where we operate, have imposed, and others in the future may impose, “shelter-in-
place” orders, quarantines, executive
75
Table of Contents
orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders or restrictions have resulted in
largely remote operations at our headquarters and centers, work stoppages among some vendors and suppliers, slowdowns and delays, travel
restrictions and cancellation of events and have restricted the ability of our front-line outreach teams to host and attend community events, among other
effects, thereby significantly and negatively impacting our operations. Other disruptions or potential disruptions include restrictions on the ability of our
personnel to travel; inability of our suppliers to manufacture goods and to deliver these to us on a timely basis, or at all; inventory shortages or
obsolescence; delays in actions of regulatory bodies; diversion of or limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the
operations of our business, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with groups of
people; business adjustments or disruptions of certain third parties; and additional government requirements or other incremental mitigation efforts. The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,
including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and spread of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact,
among others. In addition, the COVID-19 virus disproportionately impacts older adults, which describes many of our members.
It is not currently possible to reliably project the direct impact of COVID-19 on our operating revenues and expenses. Key factors include the
duration and extent of the outbreak in our service areas as well as societal and governmental responses. Members may continue to be reluctant to seek
necessary care given the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could have the effect of deterring healthcare costs that we will need to incur to later
periods and may also affect the health of members who defer treatment, which may cause our costs to increase in the future. Further, as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience slowed growth or a decline in new member demand. We also may experience increased internal and third-party
medical costs as we provide care for members suffering from COVID-19. This increase in costs may be significant given the number of our members who
are under capitation agreements. There is also a risk that, as restrictions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic are rolled back, our medical expenses may
increase in the near-to-medium term as individuals who may have delayed getting routine medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic begin making
appointments to do so. Further, we may face increased competition due to changes to our competitors’ products and services, including modifications to
their terms, conditions, and pricing that could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial condition in future
periods.
During 2020, we temporarily closed all of our corporate offices, and enabled our entire corporate work force to work remotely, the majority of which
still does. We also made operational changes to the staffing and operations of our centers to minimize potential exposure to COVID-19. We have also
implemented travel restrictions for non-essential business. If the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, especially in regions where we have offices or centers, our
business activities originating from affected areas could be adversely affected. Disruptive activities could include business closures in impacted areas,
further restrictions on our employees’ and service providers’ ability to travel, impacts to productivity if our employees or their family members experience
health issues, and potential delays in hiring and onboarding of new employees. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be
required by any global authorities where we operate or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees. Such measures could negatively
affect our sales and marketing efforts, sales cycles, employee productivity, or customer retention, any of which could harm our financial condition and
business operations.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to document the health conditions of our members as completely as we have in the past.
Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual member.
Payers with higher acuity members receive more, and those with lower acuity members receive less. Medicare requires that a member’s health issues be
documented annually regardless of the permanence of the underlying causes. Historically, this documentation was required to be completed during an in-
person visit with a member. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, Medicare is allowing documentation for
conditions identified during video visits with members. However, given the disruption caused by COVID-19, it is unclear whether we will be
76
Table of Contents
able to document the health conditions of our members as comprehensively as we did in prior years, which may adversely impact our revenue in future
periods.
Also, under the CARES Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services distributed Medicare Grants to healthcare providers to offset the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic related expenses and lost revenues, also known as the Provider Relief Funds. Grants received are subject to the terms
and conditions of the program, including that such funds may only be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and will
reimburse only for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recipients are not required to repay
these funds, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including not using the funds to reimburse expenses or losses
that other sources are obligated to reimburse. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Funds,
including demonstrating that the distributions received have been used for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to the COVID-19
pandemic. If we are unable to attest to or comply with current or future terms and conditions our ability to retain some or all of the distributions received
may be impacted.
The COVID-19 pandemic could also cause our third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers, which are critical
to our infrastructure, to shut down their business, experience security incidents that impact our business, delay or disrupt performance or delivery of
services, or experience interference with the supply chain of hardware required by their systems and services, any of which could materially adversely
affect our business. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in our employees and those of many of our vendors working from home and
conducting work via the internet, and if the network and infrastructure of internet providers becomes overburdened by increased usage or is otherwise
unreliable or unavailable, our employees’, and our customers’ and vendors’ employees’, access to the internet to conduct business could be negatively
impacted. Limitations on access or disruptions to services or goods provided by or to some of our suppliers and vendors upon which our platform and
business operations relies, could interrupt our ability to provide our platform, decrease the productivity of our workforce, and significantly harm our
business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our platform and the other systems or networks used in our business may experience an increase in attempted cyber-attacks, targeted intrusion,
ransomware, and phishing campaigns seeking to take advantage of shifts to employees working remotely using their household or personal internet
networks and to leverage fears promulgated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of any of these unauthorized attempts could substantially impact
our platform, the proprietary and other confidential data contained therein or otherwise stored or processed in our operations, and ultimately our
business. Any actual or perceived security incident also may cause us to incur increased expenses to improve our security controls and to remediate
security vulnerabilities.
The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments, including: the duration and
spread of the outbreak; government responses to the pandemic; the impact on our customers and our sales cycles; the impact on customer, industry, or
employee events; and the effect on our partners and supply chains, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Because of our business model,
the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial condition until future periods.
To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the
other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including but not limited to those relating to cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities, interruptions
or delays due to third-parties, or our ability to raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows necessary to expand our operations.
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on the repatriation of cash could adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.
Our business is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates. Although our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we operate in different geographical
areas and transact in a range of currencies in addition to the U.S.
77
Table of Contents
dollar, such as pound sterling. As a result, movements in exchange rates may cause our revenue and expenses to fluctuate, impacting our profitability,
financial position and cash flows. Future business operations and opportunities, including any continued expansion of our business outside the United
States, may further increase the risk that cash flows resulting from these activities may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. In
the event we are unable to offset these risks, there may be a material adverse impact on our business and operations. In appropriate circumstances where
we are unable to naturally offset our exposure to these currency risks, we may enter into derivative transactions to reduce such exposures. Even where
we implement hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
and involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential
accounting implications. Nevertheless, exchange rate fluctuations may either increase or decrease our revenues and expenses as reported in U.S. dollars.
Moreover, foreign governments may restrict transfers of cash out of the country and control exchange rates. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to repatriate earnings generated, or cash held, by Babylon Holdings and its subsidiaries due to exchange control restrictions or the requirements to
hold cash locally to meet regulatory solvency requirements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Any failure to offer high-quality implementation, member enrollment and ongoing support may adversely affect our relationships with our
customers, and in turn our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Though we assist with targeted marketing campaigns, we do not control our customers’ enrollment schedules. As a result, if our customers do not
allocate the internal resources necessary for a successful enrollment for their population, or enrollment launch date is delayed, we could incur significant
costs, our enrollment rate may decline, customers could become dissatisfied and decide not to increase utilization of our solution or not to implement our
solution beyond an initial period prior to their term commitment. In addition, competitors with more efficient operating models and/or lower
implementation costs could jeopardize our customer relationships.
In implementing and using our solutions, our members depend on our member support to resolve issues in a timely manner. We may be unable to
respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for member support. We also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and
delivery of our services or member support to compete with changes in solutions provided by our competitors. Increased member demand for support
could increase costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our sales are highly dependent on our reputation and on
positive recommendations from our existing members, and customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality member support, or a market perception that
we do not maintain high-quality member support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions, and in turn our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges,
including the need to develop new products, services or enhance our existing products or services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire
complementary businesses and technologies. In order to achieve these objectives, we may make future commitments of capital resources. Accordingly,
we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. In particular, if the closing of the Business Combination is delayed longer
than we expect, we may need to raise additional funding in advance of such closing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or
convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights,
preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our ordinary shares. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive
covenants relating to our capital raising activities
78
Table of Contents
and other financial and operational matters. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our
ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.
Risks Related to Government Regulation
In the United States, we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, or if
the rules and regulations change or the approach that regulators take in classifying our products and services under such regulations change, we
could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and
regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payers, our
contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular
importance are:
•
the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from
referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the physician or a member of
such physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation
arrangement) with the entity, and prohibit the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services;
•
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate
or other remuneration (i) in return for referring or to induce the referral of an individual for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of
items or services paid for in whole or in part by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) ordering, leasing,
purchasing or recommending or arranging for the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items, services, good, or facility paid for in whole or in
part by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the
statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or
services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False
Claims Act;
•
the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to
defraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or
fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-
Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed
a violation;
•
the federal False Claims Act that imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that, among other things, knowingly submit false or
fraudulent claims for payment to the government, or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim
paid, or retain identified Medicare or Medicaid overpayments and allows for qui tam or whistleblower suits by private individuals on behalf
of the government;
•
various federal healthcare-focused criminal laws that impose criminal liability for intentionally submitting false or fraudulent claims, or
making false statements, to the government;
•
reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the
Medicare or Medicaid programs;
79
Table of Contents
•
similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services
reimbursed by any payer, including patients and commercial insurers;
•
state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or
engaging in some practices such as splitting fees with physicians;
•
state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies requiring certain modality and other actions to establish a provider-patient
relationship, deliver care, or prescribe medications as part of a telehealth service;
•
state laws, regulations and policies relating to licensure and the practice of telehealth services across state lines;
•
state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding the dispensing or delivery of medications and devices;
•
state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding reporting requirements and patient consent, education, and follow-up
related to treatment, including treatment and education for certain specific topics, such as, contraception, HIV and other STIs and state
reporting for HIV, STI, and infectious diseases;
•
laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;
•
a provision of the Social Security Act that imposes penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose, or refund known overpayments;
•
federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the
services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of
services rendered; and
•
federal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to maintain licensure, certification or accreditation to enroll and
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these
programs.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our
business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Babylon has implemented a compliance program to maintain compliance
with these laws, however instances of non-compliance may prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal
penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Medicare and Medicaid programs represent a large portion of our revenue in the United States and exclusion from future participation in these
programs would significantly reduce our revenue for years to come. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by
the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety
of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with
regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations,
even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our
business and result in adverse publicity.
To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the OIG have recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare
providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations
can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our
costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for
80
Table of Contents
large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or
statement, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of
treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of
a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that
the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules
and fraud and abuse laws.
The laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you
that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review
of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our
operations.
The impact of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, but
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our revenue is dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry
is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences.
In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed, and increased access to
health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States. Since the adoption of ACA, there have been an increased
the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, increasingly, reimbursement policies tie payment to quality, alternative payment
methodologies, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program, have been adopted or piloted, enforcement of fraud and abuse laws have increased and
utilized expanded powers adopted as a part of ACA and the use of information technology has been encouraged.
Although ACA has remained largely intact in the face of multiple challenges, Federal agencies, Congress, states and other regulatory bodies have
the ability to impact the extent of the changes implemented by ACA. Accordingly, the full impact of ACA remains unknown, and we cannot predict future
actions by Federal agencies, Congress, the states and other regulatory bodies may impact the changes implemented by ACA. We expect that additional
state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and
other third-party payers will pay for healthcare products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Evolving government regulations may result in increased costs or adversely affect our results of operations.
In a regulatory climate that is uncertain, our operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or reinterpretation of various laws
and regulations. Compliance with these future laws and regulations may require us to change our practices at an undeterminable and possibly significant
initial monetary and recurring expense. These additional monetary expenditures may increase future overhead, which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.
We have identified what we believe are the areas of government regulation that, if changed, would be costly to us. These include:
•
rules governing the practice of medicine by physicians;
•
laws relating to licensure requirements for physicians and other licensed health professionals;
•
laws limiting the corporate practice of medicine and professional fee-splitting;
•
laws governing the issuances of prescriptions in an online setting;
81
Table of Contents
•
cybersecurity and privacy laws;
•
laws and licensure requirements relating to telemedicine;
•
laws and regulatory requirements relating to artificial intelligence (which are likely to become more prominent across multiple jurisdictions in
the coming years, following the European Commission’s recently announced proposal for an EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence);
•
laws and regulatory requirements relating to medical devices including software as a medical device, under English law, EU law and the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s enforcement discretion relating to “device” regulatory
requirements;
•
laws and regulations relating to the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs
and private payers (e.g., the physician self-referral law or Anti-Kickback Statute);
•
laws and regulations related to the acceptance of risk for medical expenses; and
•
laws and rules relating to the distinction between independent contractors and employees. There could be laws and regulations applicable
to our business that we have not identified or that, if changed, may be costly to us, and we cannot predict all the ways in which
implementation of such laws and regulations may affect us.
Changes in law or regulation in any jurisdiction in which we operate may lead to increased costs and/or resourcing requirements, delays, or may
require product features to be modified or discontinued. As an example, the current up-classification of many software as a medical device products in
Europe as a result of the recently enforced Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 places a burden on manufacturers who CE-mark their products, including
Babylon.
Moreover, there is an increasing trend in the European Union, United Kingdom and United States towards regulation of AI and the protection of
citizens from harm caused by AI, although no specific substantive legislation has been enacted to date.
European Union
•
On April 21, 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for an EU Regulation on AI (the “Draft Regulation”). The Draft Regulation is
not current EU law. It will proceed through a detailed legislative process (which is expected to take several years) and, if enacted, will also provide
for a transition period to enable affected parties to comply. As with previous EU legislation relating to technology (such as the GDPR), it is likely
that the final text will be significantly different from the Draft Regulation.
•
The Draft Regulation applies to providers, users, importers and distributors of AI systems. It establishes a risk-based framework of requirements
and enforcement mechanisms for various AI use-cases. This includes “high-risk” AI systems, which (among other criteria) encompass products or
components that are subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices.
•
The Draft Regulation, if enacted, would have extra-territorial effect and would apply to:
○
providers (established within or outside the EU) that supply or put an AI system into service in the EU;
○
users of AI systems located within the EU; and
○
providers and users located outside the EU, if the output produced by the AI system is used in the EU.
•
Babylon’s mobile app (including its AI-driven digital health tools, Triage and Healthcheck) is currently available for download within the EU.
Babylon could be determined to be a provider, given that it develops the app and puts it onto the market.
•
If Babylon were determined to be a provider of high-risk AI systems, its substantive obligations would include (among other measures)
implementation of compliant risk-management and data governance
82
Table of Contents
systems, creation and maintenance of technical documentation, record-keeping requirements, detailed transparency obligations and post-market
monitoring. Although Babylon has many of these in place already, the specific requirements may vary. The Draft Regulation also requires high-risk
AI systems to be CE-marked following a conformity assessment procedure. These measures could create additional costs (e.g. additional hires for
product and compliance teams) and potential delays in the development and deployment of Babylon’s AI-based products and services within the
EU. If Babylon were to fail to comply, Babylon may be subject to fines or other penalties.
•
Certain obligations in the Draft Regulation apply to users’ of high-risk AI systems, which could include Babylon’s commercial partners and
licensees. A user is any entity or person under whose authority a provider’s AI system is operated (rather than a human end-user). These
obligations include ensuring input data is relevant for the intended purpose, monitoring the operation of the AI system and keeping logs generated
by the system. As a result, Babylon may be required to implement additional operational procedures and contractual protections (with potentially
negative impacts on commercial partnership and licensing revenues) to enable its partners and licensees to comply with their own obligations when
using Babylon’s AI.
•
If Babylon were not determined to be a provider of high-risk AI systems, it could still be required to adhere to certain transparency standards under
the Draft Regulation.
United Kingdom
•
The Draft Regulation would not be part of UK law in light of Brexit. However, it would apply indirectly to parties in the UK through the extra-
territorial effect detailed above (i.e., UK-based providers/users would need to comply if supplying or using AI systems, or their output, within the
EU). Babylon’s mobile app is currently available for download in the EU. The UK government is expected to publish a national AI strategy in 2021,
but at this stage it is not possible to determine the United Kingdom’s legislative and regulatory position in relation to AI or the impact on Babylon’s
business of any future measures that may be implemented.
United States
•
Policy and legislative developments in the United States over the past two years suggest a greater focus on the regulation of AI, with a particular
emphasis on algorithmic accountability and mitigation of algorithmic bias/discrimination.
•
The Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (No. 13,859) (issued on February 11, 2019), included a guiding
principle of “fostering public trust and confidence in AI technologies”. House Resolution 153 on Supporting the Development of Guidelines for
Ethical Development of Artificial Intelligence (issued by the U.S. House of Representatives on February 27, 2019 but not yet adopted) sets out aims
for the “safe, responsible and democratic development” of AI, through principles such as transparency, privacy, accountability, access, fairness
and safety.
•
The most significant legislative development was the introduction in Congress of the bill for the federal Algorithmic Accountability Act on April
10, 2019 (the Bill”), which would require independent impact assessments to be conducted on “high-risk automated decision systems” to assess
their accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy and security, where the relevant organization meets certain threshold criteria (based on
revenue, volume of data held, or the sale/purchase of personal information). The Bill did not advance in 2019, but there are indications that it will be
reintroduced in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives in 2021.
•
If enacted and if applicable to Babylon, the Bill’s requirement to carry out detailed impact assessments could create additional costs (including
additional hires for compliance teams) and delays in Babylon’s engineering and product development processes. The Bill would also not prevent
the introduction of further legislation at state level which might, if applicable, impose additional (potentially separate or overlapping)
83
Table of Contents
requirements on Babylon. An early example is the bill for the New Jersey Algorithmic Accountability Act (introduced on May 20, 2019), which is
similar in scope and effect to the Bill and is still moving through the New Jersey legislative process.
In the jurisdictions in which we operate, even where we believe we are in compliance with all applicable laws, due to the uncertain regulatory
environment, certain jurisdictions may determine that we are in violation of their laws. In the event that we must remedy such violations, we may be
required to modify our services and products in a manner that undermines our solution’s attractiveness to our customers, consumers or providers or
experts, we may become subject to fines or other penalties or, if we determine that the requirements to operate in compliance in such jurisdictions are
overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate our operations in such places. In each case, our revenue may decline and our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Additionally, the introduction of new services may require us to comply with additional, yet undetermined, laws and regulations. Compliance may
require obtaining appropriate licenses or certificates, increasing our security measures and expending additional resources to monitor developments in
applicable rules and ensure compliance. The failure to adequately comply with these future laws and regulations may delay or possibly prevent some of
our products or services from being offered to customers, or their members and patients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Changes to the regulatory environment and market for health insurance in the United States could affect the adoption of our products and services
and our future revenue.
Our business interacts closely with the U.S. health insurance system, which is evolving and subject to a changing regulatory environment. Our
future financial performance will depend in part on growth in the market for private health insurance, as well as our ability to adapt to regulatory
developments.
Changes and developments in the health insurance system in the United States could reduce demand for our services and harm our business. For
example, there has been an ongoing national debate relating to the health insurance system in the United States. Certain elected officials have introduced
proposals to expand the Medicare program, ranging from proposals that would create a new single-payer national health insurance program for all United
States residents, replacing virtually all other sources of public and private insurance, to more incremental approaches, such as lowering the age of
eligibility for the Medicare program, expanding Medicare to a larger population, or creating a new public health insurance option that would compete with
private insurers. Additionally, proposals to establish a single-payer or government-run health care system at the state level have been introduced in some
of our key states, such as New York and California. At the federal level, President Biden and Congress may consider other legislation and/or executive
orders to change elements of the ACA. In December 2019, a federal appeals court held that the individual mandate portion of the ACA was
unconstitutional and left open the question whether the remaining provisions of the ACA would be valid without the individual mandate. On November
10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in this matter, and in June 2021, the Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no
legal standing to challenge the ACA, upholding the ACA. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order that states it is the policy of
his administration to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the ACA, and to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable to all Americans, and
directs the Secretary of HHS to consider opening a special enrollment period for uninsured and under-insured Americans to seek individual market
coverage through the federal health insurance marketplace. On the same day, in response to the President’s Executive Order, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (“CMS”), announced a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021, which has been extended to August
15, 2021 due to the coronavirus public health emergency, for uninsured and under- insured individuals and families to seek coverage through the federal
health insurance marketplace. The Executive Order also directs federal agencies to examine agency actions to determine whether they are consistent with
that the Administration’s commitment regarding the ACA, and begin rulemaking to suspend, revise, or rescind any inconsistent actions. Areas of focus
include policies or practices that may reduce affordability of coverage, present unnecessary barriers to individuals
84
Table of Contents
and families attempting to access Medicare or ACA coverage, or undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. We continue to evaluate
the effect that the ACA and its possible modifications, repeal and replacement may have on our business.
There may also be changes on the state level that could adversely impact our business. For example, the California Department of Health Care
Services (“DHCS”), is anticipated to begin the process of recontracting with Medi-Cal managed care plans in 2021. If the Medi-Cal managed care plans
that we currently contract with change as a result of this DHCS request for proposal and procurement process, and we are unable to secure new contracts
with the new Medi-Cal managed care plans, the demand in our services may decrease and harm our business.
Opposition in the United Kingdom to the involvement of private sector providers in the delivery of healthcare services could adversely affect our
business.
Our business in England interacts closely with the NHS, including through our delivery of our Babylon GP at Hand offering. The involvement of
independent sector providers in the NHS is a regularly discussed topic. Independent providers have long played a role in the delivery of services in the
NHS. Whilst we are unaware that a central record of independent sector spend by the NHS is retained, critics claim that spend in this area has increased
over time and undermines the NHS core values. In the recent past, both Labour and Conservative governments have used independent providers to
increase patient choice and competition, as well as increasing capacity to provide services. In recent years, there have been large scale attempts to
procure services from providers which have included independent sector providers which have received criticism and created delays. Tenders and
contracts have been abandoned, and the debate on the “privatization of the NHS” has come from local stakeholders including patients, the public and
physicians, as well as being a political topic. It is unlikely that the “privatization of the NHS” narrative will entirely subside. It will remain a risk to our
business and it is likely that significant changes to the state of play of health in the United States may become part of the commentary in this debate.
In February 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care in England published a White Paper titled “Integration and Innovation: working
together to improve health and social care for all”, or the NHS White Paper, which sets out proposals for health and care legislation. The NHS White
Paper brings together proposals that build on recommendations from the NHS system and additional measures relating to the Secretary of State for
Health’s powers over the system. The NHS White Paper is detailed with broad proposals including working together and integration; stripping out
bureaucracy; enhancing public confidence and accountability; and additional proposals to support public health, social care, quality and safety. There is
very little or no detail in the NHS White Paper regarding independent sector providers of health and care services in England. Notably, there is a proposal
to remove the commissioning of NHS and public health services from the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, to be replaced by a bespoke Provider
Selection Regime and a duty on commissioners (purchasers) of NHS services to act in the best interests of members. The procurement of non-clinical
services will remain subject to the procurement rules. The Provider Selection Regime, if implemented as proposed to date, may make it easier for decision
makers not to award contracts through open, competitive procurement processes and that poorly performing services may remain unimproved. The
mechanism for challenge is likely to be through judicial review. There appears, at this stage, to be a move to strengthen the “Any Qualified Provider” or
“AQP” arrangements which may be beneficial to providers of health services. We continue to evaluate the impact of the NHS White Paper and its
possible amendments to existing legislation and NHS guidance on our business.
In February 2021, the NHS Commissioning Board, an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of Health and Social
Care, issued a consultation on proposals for the NHS Provider Selection Regime. The consultation has now closed, and further detail is awaited as
regards the future of NHS clinical and public health service commissioning. In the meantime, there is uncertainty as pertains to the future of procurement
legislation.
In addition, there is a risk that the NHS Commissioning Board could challenge how the Babylon GP at Hand contractual structure operates, or that
the legislation regarding the persons eligible to enter into a general medical
85
Table of Contents
services contract could change such that the contractual structure does not comply with legislation. The Babylon GP at Hand contractual structure is
reliant on four individuals holding the general medical services contract in their individual capacity. While Babylon has broad control regarding two of
these individuals, we are reliant on our working relationship with the other two. We believe that our operations are in line with other corporate entities
delivering general medical services in England; however, any scrutiny, investigation, or litigation with regard to our arrangement could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements
to comply with applicable laws or we are required to restructure at a significant cost, or if we were subject to penalties or other adverse action.
We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to
liability if we violate such laws and regulations.
We and our products in many cases are subject to U.S. import and export controls and trade and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S.
Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury
Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and solutions to certain countries,
governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Exports of our products and services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations
when applicable. If in the future we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal penalties,
including loss of export privileges and substantial fines for us and for the individuals working for us.
In addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and
licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solution or permit the use of our platform in those countries.
Changes in our solution, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our members with international operations from deploying
our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solution to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change
in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by
such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or
potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solution would likely
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments
of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions
and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations,
collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. While we have mechanisms to identify high-risk individuals and entities before contracting with them,
an instance of non-compliance with all such applicable laws could result in our being subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other
sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of such laws by United Kingdom, United
States or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws.
Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “Bribery Act”), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the U.S. domestic bribery statute at
86
Table of Contents
18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws that apply in countries where we do business. The
Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and our employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and
third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of
value, to recipients in the public or private sector in order to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.
We sometimes leverage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing
to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners our third-party
intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may
be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if
we do not explicitly authorize those activities. While we have mechanisms to identify high-risk individuals and entities before contracting with them, we
operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations. We cannot assure you that all of our employees,
agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will not take actions that violate applicable law, for which we may be ultimately
held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.
These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent
any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with those laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees,
agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will take actions that violate our policies and applicable law, for which we may be
ultimately held responsible. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international
operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
Any allegations or violation of the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws
could result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage,
investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from government contracts, all of which may have
an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and prospects. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a
materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.
Failure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results.
In many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to
ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned in each jurisdiction and are taxed accordingly. Although we believe that we are in
substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer
pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed. In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may
or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect.
The enactment of legislation implementing changes in tax legislation or policies in different geographic jurisdictions including the United Kingdom
and the United States could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. Our consolidated effective income tax rate could be materially
adversely affected by several factors, including: changing tax laws,
87
Table of Contents
regulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof; tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration (such as those related to the Organization for
Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, project, the European Commission’s state aid
investigations and other initiatives); the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or
examinations and any related interest or penalties. Such changes may include (but are not limited to) the taxation of operating income, investment income,
dividends received or (in the specific context of withholding tax) dividends, royalties and interest paid.
We are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but
such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase the
estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheets, and otherwise affect our financial position, future results
of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce post-tax
returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance.
The applicability of value-added, sales, use, withholding and other tax laws or regulations on our business is uncertain. Adverse tax laws or
regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could subject us to additional tax liability and related
interest and penalties, increase the costs of our solution and adversely impact our business.
The application of tax laws and regulations to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use, value-added or other tax laws,
statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect), and could be applied solely or
disproportionately to services provided over the internet or could otherwise materially affect our financial position and results of operations.
In addition, different tax jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value-added and other taxes, and these rules and
regulations can be complex and are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or
ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect). Although our customer contracts
typically provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes, our customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and associated
interest or penalties, or we may determine that it would not be commercially feasible to seek reimbursement. In addition, we or our customers could be
required to pay additional tax amounts on both future as well as prior sales, and possibly fines or penalties and interest for past due taxes. If we are
required to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties, and if the amount we are required to collect and pay exceeds our estimates
and reserves, or if we are unsuccessful in collecting such amounts from our customers, we could incur potentially substantial unplanned expenses,
thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. Imposition of such taxes on our services going forward or collection of sales tax from
our customers in respect of prior sales could also adversely affect our sales activity and have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.
Furthermore, a tax authority may disagree with tax positions that we have taken, which could result in increased tax liabilities. For example, Her
Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, or HMRC, or another tax authority could challenge our allocation of income by tax jurisdiction and the amounts paid
between our affiliated companies pursuant to our intercompany arrangements and transfer pricing policies, including methodologies for valuing
developed technology and amounts paid with respect to our intellectual property development. Similarly, a tax authority could assert that we are subject
to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable connection, often referred to as a “permanent establishment” under
international tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, a tax
authority may take the position that material income tax liabilities, interest and penalties are payable by us, where there has been a technical violation of
contradictory laws and regulations that are relatively new and have not been subject to extensive review or interpretation, in which case we expect that
we might contest such
88
Table of Contents
assessment. High-profile companies can be particularly vulnerable to aggressive application of unclear requirements. Many companies must negotiate
their tax bills with tax inspectors who may demand higher taxes than applicable law appears to provide. Contesting such an assessment may be lengthy
and costly and if we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could increase our anticipated effective tax rate, where applicable.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Legal Proceedings
If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology or if the scope of our intellectual property
protection is not sufficiently broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology substantially similar to ours, and our ability to
successfully commercialize our technology may be adversely affected.
Our business depends on internally developed technology and content, including software, databases, confidential information and know-how, the
protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of registered and unregistered rights, including patents and
registered trademarks, as well as trade-secret and copyright laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual
property rights in our internally developed technology and content, as well as our brand. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our
intellectual property through additional patent, trademark and other intellectual property filings. Effective patent, trade-secret, copyright and trademark
protection is expensive and time-consuming to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of
defending our rights. These measures, however, may not be sufficient to offer us meaningful protection.
Much of our technology and software is maintained as trade secret and not protected by patents. Our employees, consultants and other parties
(including independent contractors and companies with which we conduct business) may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secret
information or technology to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally disclosed or obtained and is using any of our internally developed
information, technology or content is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United
States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. We rely, in part, on non-disclosure, confidentiality
and assignment-of-invention agreements (or equivalent contractual provisions) with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and
companies with which we conduct business to protect our trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property and internally developed information.
These agreements may not be self-executing (i.e., they may require further legislative or judicial action before they can take effect or become enforceable),
or they may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach. Moreover, third parties may independently develop similar or
equivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access, whether authorized or unauthorized, to our trade secrets, know-how and other internally
developed information.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and other IP and other proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be
harmed, as third parties may be able to commercialize and use technologies and software products that are substantially the same as ours without
incurring the development and/or licensing costs that we have incurred. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged,
invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Any of our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an
unauthorized manner to third parties or otherwise misappropriated. In addition, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide us with
freedom to operate or technology that will permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide us with competitive advantages,
which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain offerings or other competitive harm.
Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we may seek to analyze our competitors’ services,
and may in the future seek to enforce our intellectual property against
89
Table of Contents
potential infringement. However, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent infringement or
misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual
property. Any inability to meaningfully protect or assert our intellectual property rights could result in harm to our ability to compete and reduce demand
for our technology. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and
business opportunities.
Uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts
and agencies in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual
property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage. Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could
therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of
which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our commercial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize our services and use our internally developed technology without
infringing the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our
business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. As the market for digital healthcare, both in the United States and globally, expands and
more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our technology of which we are not aware or that
we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Whether merited or not, we may face allegations that we, our customers or other
parties indemnified by us have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun
purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements. We may also face
allegations that our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former employers or other third parties. It may
be necessary for us to initiate litigation to defend ourselves in order to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party intellectual property
or proprietary rights, or to establish our respective rights. We may not be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such adversarial proceedings or
litigation. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us we may be required to engage in or to continue claims, regardless
of whether such claims have merit. This can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and financial resources and can be costly to evaluate and
defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop commercializing or using our technology, obtain licenses, modify
our services and technology while we develop non-infringing substitutes or incur substantial damages, settlement costs or face a temporary or
permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected services (which may cause us to breach contractual obligations). If we
require a third-party license, it may not be available, either on reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or
grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights relating to our products, services or solutions. We may also have to redesign our products, services or
solutions so they do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and
time, during which our technology may not be available for commercialization or use. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs,
the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not obtain a third-party license to the infringed
technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or obtain similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be
adversely impacted.
From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. We
are not currently subject to any claims from third parties asserting infringement
90
Table of Contents
of their intellectual property rights. Some third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they
have substantially greater resources. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause
us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be
public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive
these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares. Moreover, any uncertainties resulting from the
initiation and continuation of any legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our
operations. Assertions by third parties that we infringe or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may become subject to medical liability claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses and may require us to pay significant
damages if not covered by insurance.
Our business entails the risk of medical liability claims against both our providers and us. We carry insurance (and in relation to clinical negligence
claims in the United Kingdom arising from care delivered within Babylon GP at Hand NHS primary medical services, we are indemnified by a national
state-backed indemnity scheme under NHS Resolution) covering medical malpractice claims in amounts that we believe are appropriate in light of the risks
attendant to our business and/or as required under applicable law, and the physician-owned entities with which we partner carry insurance for
themselves and each of their healthcare professionals (our providers). However, successful medical liability claims could result in substantial damage
awards that exceed the limits of our and our providers’ insurance coverage. In addition, professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance
premiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our services. As a result, adequate professional liability insurance may not be
available to our providers or to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all.
Any claims made against us that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against, result in substantial damage awards against
us and divert the attention of our management and our providers from our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any claims may adversely affect our business or reputation.
We have been and may in the future become subject to litigation or regulatory investigation, which could harm our business.
Our business entails the risk of liability claims against us, and we have been and may in the future become subject to litigation. Claims against us
may be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of parties, including our customers, our members, vendors of our customers, government agencies, our
current or former employees, our shareholders, or the entities in which we invest and/or their shareholders. We expect there to be an increase in litigation
related to employer practices and healthcare in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and
potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, covered by adequate insurance. Although we carry public liability and
product liability insurance, as well as medical malpractice insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate considering the risks attendant to our
business, successful claims could result in substantial damage awards that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. In addition, any determination
that we are acting in the capacity of a healthcare provider, or exercising undue influence or control over a healthcare provider, or any adverse
determination by a data privacy authority in respect of our users’ data, may subject us to claims not covered by our insurance coverage, or could result in
significant sanctions against us and our clinicians, additional compliance requirements, expense, and liability to us. In addition, insurance coverage is
expensive and insurance premiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our solutions. As a result, adequate coverage may
not be available to us or to our providers in the future at acceptable costs or at all. We generally intend to defend ourselves vigorously; however, we
cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of some of these types of matters against us may result
in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments, and settlements
91
Table of Contents
exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby harming our business and per share trading price of our ordinary
shares. For example, fines or assessments could be levied against us under domestic or foreign data privacy laws (such as HIPAA, the GDPR, or the
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”)) or under authority of privacy enforcing governmental entities (such as the Federal Trade Commission
(“FTC”), or the HHS) or as a result of private actions, such as class actions based on data breaches or based on private rights of action (such as that
contained in the CCPA). Additionally, a successful product liability, warranty, or other similar claim against us could have an adverse effect on our
business, operating results, and financial condition.
Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely
impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and adversely impact our ability to attract directors
and officers. In addition, such litigation could result in increased scrutiny by government authorities having authority over our business, such as the
FTC, the HHS, Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), and state attorneys general.
In England, Babylon and Babylon GP at Hand are both registered providers with the CQC. In the event of enforcement action arising from a clinical
incident by either provider, there is a risk of fines. These can be modest Fixed Penalty Fines (for example for noncompliance with notification deadlines, or
an administrative step in relation to duty of candor); however, if they relate to matters of safe care, fines can be more significant and relate to the
provider’s turnover. This is ring-fenced to the legal entity that is registered, but remains a risk for any healthcare provider registered with the CQC. Other
regulators in the sector continue to present a fines risk, for example the Health and Safety executive, for non-clinical care incidents, and the U.K.
Information Commissioner’s Office for data breaches or noncompliance with information law legislation.
Babylon is also subject to various regulations as to the use of certain medical technology. In certain jurisdictions, the rules governing the
application of Babylon’s technology may not align with the nature of Babylon’s products and services, in which case Babylon may incur costs and
delays in obtaining clearances in those markets or penalties for failure to conform to certain registration requirements. For example, we have in the past
and expect to continue to have interactions with the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency about the proper classification of certain
of our products and services, which may result in requiring us to register different products and services or changing, reducing functionality of or access
to certain of our products and services.
Risks Related to Information Technology and Data
Security breaches and incidents, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or members, or
prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, use and disclose sensitive data, including protected health information (“PHI”), and other
types of personal data or personally identifiable information (“PII”). We also process and store, and use additional third parties to process and store,
sensitive information including intellectual property and other proprietary business information, including that of our members and customers. Our
member information is encrypted but not always de-identified and/or anonymized. We manage and maintain our solution and data utilizing a combination
of on-site systems, managed data center systems and cloud-based computing center systems.
We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to securely process, transmit and store this
critical information. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar
breaches, and employee or contractor error, negligence or malfeasance, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure or
modifications of confidential information, causing member health information to be accessed or acquired
92
Table of Contents
without authorization or to become publicly available. We utilize third-party service providers for important aspects of the collection, storage and
transmission of customer, user and member information, and other confidential and sensitive information, and therefore rely on third parties to manage
functions that have material cybersecurity risks. Because of the sensitivity of the PHI, other PII, and other confidential information we and our service
providers collect, store, transmit, and otherwise process, the security of our technology platform and other aspects of our services, including those
provided or facilitated by our third-party service providers, are important to our operations and business strategy. We take certain administrative,
physical and technological safeguards to address these risks, such as by requiring outsourcing subcontractors who handle customer, user and member
information for us to enter into agreements that contractually obligate those subcontractors to use reasonable efforts to safeguard PHI, other PII, and
other sensitive information. In addition, Babylon Holdings’ audit committee, which reports to Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, has historically been
responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity risk management processes. Our audit committee is responsible for reviewing our policies with respect to
data protection and cybersecurity risk assessment and risk management. Measures taken to protect our systems and those of our subcontractors, or the
PHI, other PII, or other sensitive data we or our subcontractors process or maintain, may not adequately protect us from the risks associated with the
collection, storage and transmission of such information. Although we take steps to help protect confidential and other sensitive information from
unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure or those of our subcontractors may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers
or viruses, failures or breaches due to third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
A privacy or data protection violation, or a security breach or incident, that leads to disclosure or unauthorized use, modification of, or other
processing, or that prevents access to or otherwise impacts the confidentiality, security, or integrity of, member information, including PHI or other PII, or
other sensitive information we or our subcontractors maintain or otherwise process, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with breach
notification laws, cause us to incur significant costs for remediation, fines, penalties, notification to individuals and for measures intended to repair or
replace systems or technology and to prevent future occurrences, potential increases in insurance premiums, and require us to verify the accuracy of
database contents, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement
satisfactory remedial measures, or if it is perceived that we have been unable to do so, our operations could be disrupted, we may be unable to provide
access to our platform, and could suffer a loss of customers or users or a decrease in the use of our platform, and we may suffer loss of reputation, harm
to our market position, adverse impacts on customer, user and investor confidence, financial loss, governmental investigations or other actions,
regulatory or contractual penalties, and other claims and liability. In addition, security breaches and incidents and other inappropriate access to, or
acquisition or processing of, information can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying such incident, mitigating and otherwise responding to any
incidents, or in providing any notification of such incidents may lead to increased harm. Finally, insurance market conditions are evolving given the
extent of security incidents creating premium and coverage availability risk.
Any such breach or incident, or disruption to or interruption of our systems or any of our third-party information technology partners, could
compromise our networks or data security processes, disrupt our operations, and sensitive information could be destroyed, corrupted, or inaccessible or
could be accessed, obtained, or disclosed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such interruption in access, improper access,
disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy of member
information or other personal information, such as HIPAA, the GDPR, the DPA 2018, and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (“U.K. GDPR”), and
regulatory fines or penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to perform our services,
provide member assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide
information about our current and future solutions and engage in other user and clinician education and outreach efforts. Any such breach or incident
could also result in the loss or compromise of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could adversely affect our business and
competitive position. While we maintain insurance
93
Table of Contents
covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all
liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.
Our use, disclosure, and other processing of information relating to individuals, including health information, is subject to HIPAA, the GDPR, the
DPA 2018, the U.K. GDPR, and other privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with those laws and
regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold and that is processed in our business could result in significant liability or reputational
harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base and revenue.
Numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity,
and other processing of PHI and PII. These laws and regulations include HIPAA. HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for
the protection of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered
entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Babylon’s U.S. entities that directly provide healthcare
services are covered entities under HIPAA. Babylon U.S. entities are both covered entities under HIPAA and business association under HIPAA. We
execute business associate agreements with our customers.
HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is used or
disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the use of
standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare
transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.
HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations start at $100 per
violation and are not to exceed $50,000 per violation, subject to a cap of $1.5 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. However,
a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their
residents. Courts may award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private
right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil
suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.
In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates for
compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were
the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator.
HIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that
compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees
or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days
after discovery of the breach.” If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the
name of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the
local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and
security of PHI and other types of PII. These laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its
implementing rules. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changed or differing
94
Table of Contents
interpretations, and we expect new laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in
the future.
For example, the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), provides new data privacy rights for California residents. The
enforcement of the CCPA by the California Attorney General commenced July 1, 2020. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or
operations, but we may be required to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in connection with
our compliance or the compliance of our customers, service providers, or other third parties. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties and a private right
of action for violations, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act
(“CPRA”), was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on
January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. We will continue to monitor
developments related to the CPRA, and anticipate needing to incur additional costs and expenses associated with compliance with CPRA compliance.
Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these
areas. Many obligations under the CCPA and these other laws and legislative proposals remain uncertain, and we cannot fully predict their impact on our
business. If we fail to comply with any of these laws or standards, we may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions, civil litigation, fines and
other penalties, all of which may generate negative publicity and have a negative impact on our business.
Outside of the United States, we, along with a significant number of our customers, are subject to laws, rules, regulations, guidance and industry
standards related to data privacy and cyber security, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection,
retention or transfer of data. For example, the GDPR and, now that the U.K. has exited the EU, the DPA 2018 and the U.K. GDPR, contain numerous
requirements and changes from previous European Union law, including more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers and heavier
documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Specifically, the numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the
EU were introduced, including greater control over personal data by data subjects (e.g., the “right to be forgotten”), increased data portability for EU
consumers, data breach notification requirements (which differ to those listed under HIPAA above and increased fines. In particular, under the GDPR, the
Data Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. GDPR, fines of up to €20 million (£17.5 million in the UK) or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the
noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for certain violations. The GDPR and Data Protection 2018 requirements apply not only to
third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. Depending on the
contractual relationship with out relevant counterparty, we are required to comply with the GDPR and the DPA 2018 as a “Data Controller” and a “Data
Processor” as appropriate. In 2018, we appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee and supervise our compliance with GDPR and the DPA 2018 data
protection regulations. As a result of various changes in relation to European data transfer rules existing and future transfers of European originated
personal data will have to be assessed and possibly revisited to take into consideration the changes. This is likely to trigger specific remediation costs
and expenses in 2021 and 2022.
Globally, governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards
covering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, online, the use of data to inform
marketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use,
processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users. For example, in addition to the GDPR, the
European Commission has another draft regulation in the approval process that focuses on a person’s right to conduct a private life. The proposed
legislation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “ePrivacy Regulation”) would replace the current ePrivacy Directive.
Originally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still being negotiated. Most recently, on
February 10, 2021, the Council of the EU agreed on its
95
Table of Contents
version of the draft ePrivacy Regulation. If adopted, the earliest date for entry into force is in 2023, with broad potential impacts on the use of internet-
based services and tracking technologies, such as cookies. Aspects of the ePrivacy Regulation remain for negotiation between the European
Commission, the European Parliament and the Council. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of the ePrivacy Regulation as
it is finalized for implementation. In the UK, a well known privacy campaigning organization is driving a cookie compliance campaign. They also submitted
complaints against hundreds of companies and their website ePrivacy (namely cookie) practices, and whether or not they give users the option to
consent to the placement of certain cookies or not. This campaign means that there is a higher risk of enforcement action. More generally, new laws,
regulations, or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase the costs of doing
business and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.
While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the GDPR, the DPA 2018, and the U.K. GDPR, on us and despite our ongoing efforts to bring
practices into compliance, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control, such as limited financial or human resources, or
other factors outside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the GDPR or other data
protection laws, leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU member states or between the United Kingdom and one or more countries in the
European Economic Area (“EEA”) or otherwise. Any failure or perceived failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures, or
measures relating to privacy, data protection, data security, marketing, or customer communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies,
legal or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy, data protection, or data security, may result in
governmental investigations and other proceedings, and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, as well as claims,
complaints, and litigation and other proceedings from private actors, and resulting damages and other liabilities, and could cause our customers lose trust
in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.
This complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection, and information security creates significant compliance issues for us and
our customers and potentially exposes us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. While we have implemented measures in an effort to
comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, some PHI and other PII or confidential information is
transmitted to us by third parties, who may not implement adequate security and privacy measures, and it is possible that laws, rules and regulations
relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices or those of
third parties who transmit PHI and other PII or confidential information to us. If we or these third parties are accused of having violated such laws, rules
or regulations, it could result in claims, proceedings, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, damages, liabilities, and government-imposed
fines, penalties (including audits and enforcement actions to stop data processing activities), orders requiring that we or these third parties change our or
their practices, or criminal charges, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to
incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.
We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing,
consumer communications and data security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such
future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed
interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new services and maintain and grow our customer base and
increase revenue.
Any disruption of service at our third-party data and call centers or Amazon Web Services could interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our services
to our customers.
We currently host our platform, serve our customers primarily using Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), a provider of cloud infrastructure services.
We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of our data
96
Table of Contents
and call center providers or AWS. Also, there are limited auditing rights for us to exercise against such data processors under Article 28. As such, there is
a greater risk of not being able to confirm compliance and meet other contractual obligations, such as obligations to customers that we have sufficient
controls in place with third party suppliers. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber
security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism,
a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our solution. The
facilities also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. Our solutions’ continuing
and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Because our solutions and services are used by our members for health purposes, it is critical
that our solutions be accessible without interruption or degradation of performance. Members may become dissatisfied by any system failure that
interrupts our ability to provide our solutions to them. Outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to
our customers, in which case, we may not be fully indemnified for such losses pursuant to our agreement with AWS. We may not be able to easily switch
our AWS operations to another cloud provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of AWS. Sustained or repeated system failures would
reduce the attractiveness of our solution to customers and members and result in contract terminations, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative
publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our solution. We may not carry sufficient
business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.
Neither our third-party data and call center providers nor AWS have an obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable
terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these providers on commercially reasonable terms, if our agreements with our providers are
prematurely terminated, or if in the future we add additional data or call center providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the
transfer to, or the addition of, new providers. If these providers were to increase the cost of their services, we may have to increase the price of our
solutions, and our operating results may be adversely impacted.
We rely on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software and other third parties for providing services
to our customers and members, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could expose us to litigation and
negatively impact our relationships with customers and members, adversely affecting our operating results.
Our ability to deliver our digital services depends on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. This
includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, bandwidth capacity and security. Our services are
designed to operate without interruption. However, we may experience future interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. In the
event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of our systems, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could
negatively impact our relationship with customers and members. Outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of
credits to our customers, in which case, we may not be fully indemnified for such losses pursuant to our agreement with our service providers. In
addition, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solution to customers and members and result in contract
terminations, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may
adversely impact use of our solution. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:
•
damage from fire, power loss, natural disasters and other force majeure events outside our control;
•
communications failures;
•
software and hardware errors, failures, and crashes;
•
security breaches and incidents, computer viruses, hacking, denial-of-service and ransomware attacks, and similar disruptive problems; and
•
other potential interruptions.
97

We also rely on software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services. These licenses are generally commercially available on varying
terms. However, it is possible that this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use
any of this software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is
identified, obtained and integrated. Furthermore, our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements
with third parties, and integration of our software with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our
time and resources.
Also, any interruption in the services provided by our third-party service providers, undetected errors or defects in third-party software could
prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our software, delay new updates or enhancements to our solution, result in a failure of our solution,
and injure our reputation. For example, we rely on third-party billing provider software to transmit the actual claims to payers based on the specific payer
billing format. If this provider experiences an interruption in service or makes changes to its invoicing system, we may experience delays in claims
processing. If we are required to switch to a different software provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process
these claims and receipt of payments from payers, or possibly denial of claims for lack of timely submission, which would have an adverse effect on our
revenue and our business.
There can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers, including third party providers of data services
or cloud infrastructure services, have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats, and we cannot guarantee that our systems
and networks or those of our third-party service providers have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could
result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. While we
maintain measures designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and security of our data and other data we maintain or otherwise process, our security
measures or those of our third-party service providers could fail and result in unauthorized access to or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or
destruction of such data.
Neither our service providers nor our licensors have an obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If
we are unable to renew our agreements with such parties on commercially reasonable terms or if our agreements with our providers are prematurely
terminated, or if in the future we add additional service providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition
of, new providers. If these providers were to increase the cost of their services, we may have to increase the price of our solutions, and our operating
results may be adversely impacted.
Risks Related to Ownership of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Operating as a Public Company
The trading price of our Babylon Class A Shares could be volatile, and the value of our Babylon Class A Shares may decline.
We cannot predict the prices at which our Babylon Class A Shares will trade. The price of our Babylon Class A Shares may not bear any
relationship to the market price at which our Babylon Class A Shares will trade after the Transactions or to any other established criteria of the value of
our business and prospects, and the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares following the Transactions may fluctuate substantially and may be lower
than the price agreed by Alkuri with Babylon in connection with the Transactions. In addition, the trading price of our Babylon Class A Shares following
the Transactions is likely to be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These
fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Babylon Class A Shares as you might be unable to sell your shares at or above
the price you paid in the Transactions. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Babylon Class A Shares include the following:
•
price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
98
Table of Contents
•
volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of technology and healthcare company stocks;
•
changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in
particular;
•
sales of shares of our Babylon Class A Shares by us or our shareholders;
•
failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or
our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
•
the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;
•
announcements by us or our competitors of new products or contracts;
•
the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;
•
changes in how customers perceive the benefits of our products and services, and future product offerings;
•
changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;
•
rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;
•
actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;
•
actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;
•
litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;
•
developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;
•
any significant data breach involving our products, services or site or data stored by us or on our behalf;
•
announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, commercial relationships, products, services, or technologies by us or our
competitors;
•
new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;
•
changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;
•
any adverse consequences related to our dual-class capital structure, such as stock index providers excluding companies with dual-class
capital structures from certain indices;
•
any significant change in our management; and
•
general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.
In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our
Babylon Class A Shares could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The trading price of our Babylon
Class A Shares might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the
past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that
company. If our share price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert
our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Table of Contents
A market for our securities may not develop or be sustained, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our Babylon Class A Shares.
Following the Closing, the price of our Babylon Class A Shares may fluctuate significantly due to the market’s reaction to the Business
Combination and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities following the Business Combination may never
develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities after the Business Combination can vary due to general economic
conditions and forecasts, Babylon’s general business condition and the release of Babylon’s financial reports. Additionally, if our securities become
delisted from the NYSE and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national
securities exchange) or Babylon’s securities are not listed on the NYSE and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the liquidity and price of our securities
may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, the NYSE or another national securities exchange. The lack of an
active market may impair your ability to sell your Babylon securities at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An
inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling securities and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies
using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.
Because Babylon will become a public reporting company by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, the shareholders of
Babylon may face additional risks and uncertainties.
Because Babylon will become a public reporting company by means of consummating the Business Combination rather than by means of a
traditional underwritten initial public offering, there is no independent third-party underwriter selling the shares of Babylon’s common stock, and,
accordingly, the shareholders of Babylon will not have the benefit of an independent review and investigation of the type normally performed by an
unaffiliated, independent underwriter in a public securities offering. Due diligence reviews typically include an independent investigation of the
background of the company, any advisors and their respective affiliates, review of the offering documents and independent analysis of the plan of
business and any underlying financial assumptions. Because there is no independent third-party underwriter selling Babylon’s ordinary shares, Alkuri
Stockholders must rely on the information included in this proxy statement/prospectus. Although Alkuri’s management conducted a due diligence review
and investigation of Babylon Holdings in connection with the Business Combination, the lack of an independent due diligence review and investigation
increases the risk of investment in Babylon because it may not have uncovered facts that would be important to a potential investor.
Moreover, the shareholders of Babylon will not benefit from possible recourse against an underwriter for material misstatements or omissions in
this proxy statement/prospectus or additional roles of the underwriters in a traditional underwritten initial public offering, such as the book-building
process, which helps inform efficient price discovery, and underwriter support to help stabilize the public price of the new issue immediately after listing.
The lack of such recourse process and support in connection with Babylon’s ordinary shares could result in greater potential for errors, diminished
investor demand, inefficiencies in pricing and a more volatile public price for the shares during the period immediately following the listing.
In addition, because Babylon will not become a public reporting company by means of a traditional underwritten initial public offering, security or
industry analysts may not provide, or be less likely to provide, coverage of Babylon. Investment banks may also be less likely to agree to underwrite
secondary offerings on behalf of Babylon than they might if Babylon became a public reporting company by means of a traditional underwritten initial
public offering, because they may be less familiar with Babylon as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media. The failure to receive
research coverage or support in the market for Babylon’s ordinary shares could have an adverse effect on Babylon’s ability to develop a liquid market for
Babylon’s ordinary shares.

If securities or industry analysts publish reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community or publish negative research reports
about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our Babylon Class A Shares depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts
publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts or the information contained in their reports. If one or more analysts
publish research reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community, or have a negative tone regarding our business, financial condition
or results of operations, industry or end-markets, our share price could decline. In addition, if a majority of these analysts cease coverage of our company
or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.
The dual class structure of our ordinary shares has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Founder, which will limit your ability to
influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.
Our Babylon Class B Shares have fifteen (15) votes per share, and our Babylon Class A Shares have one (1) vote per share. Upon the Closing, the
Founder will hold all of the issued and outstanding Babylon Class B Shares, including the Stockholder Earnout Shares. Accordingly, assuming no
redemptions by Alkuri Stockholders with respect to their shares of Alkuri Common Stock, Dr. Parsadoust will hold 81.7% of the voting power (taking
account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon’s outstanding ordinary shares following Closing. Therefore, our Founder will be able to
significantly influence and pass without other shareholder support matters submitted to Babylon shareholders for approval, including the election and
removal of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, issuance of new shares, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all
of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Founder may in certain circumstances have sufficient voting control over Babylon to amend
Babylon’s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights attached to Babylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder
terminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control of Babylon following his separation and continue to have the rights
described in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon. Our Founder may have interests that differ from yours and may vote or take corporate
action in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,
preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Babylon
Class A Shares as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares.
Future transfers by our Founder of Babylon Class B Shares will generally result in those shares converting into Babylon Class A Shares, subject to
limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. For information about our dual class structure, see the
section titled “Description of Babylon’s Share Capital and Articles of Association.”
We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the trading market for our Babylon Class A Shares.
We cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Babylon Class A Shares or in adverse
publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class
share structures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public
companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P
MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened
public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices;
however, in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new
index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria.
Under the announced policies, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual
funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt
101
Table of Contents
to passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will
have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to
those of other similar companies that are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we
cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to
track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Babylon Class A Shares
less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares could be adversely affected.
We are an “emerging growth company,” and our election to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our
ordinary shares less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we may remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i)
the last day of the fiscal year (A) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Alkuri IPO, (B) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at
least $1.07 billion, or (C) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our outstanding ordinary shares that are
held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
during the prior three year period.
For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that
are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the independent auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, being required to provide fewer years of audited financial statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a
non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may
choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of these reduced reporting burdens. Accordingly, the information we provide to our shareholders may be
different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.
Babylon will be a “foreign private issuer” and, as a result, we will be permitted to rely on exemptions from certain stock exchange corporate
governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers. This may afford less protection to holders of Babylon Class A Shares.
Upon the Closing, as a foreign private issuer whose ordinary shares are listed on the NYSE, we will be permitted to follow certain home country
corporate governance practices in lieu of requirements under U.S. securities laws that apply to U.S. domestic public companies, including
•
the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;
•
the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under
the Exchange Act; and
•
the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for
insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time.
We will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our
results on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the NYSE rules. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will
also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely
compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that
would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.
102
Table of Contents
In addition, as a foreign private issuer we will be exempt from the provisions of Regulation Fair Disclosure (“Regulation FD”), which prohibits
issuers from making selective disclosure of material nonpublic information. Even though we intend to comply voluntarily with Regulation FD, these
exemptions and leniencies will reduce the frequency and scope of information and protections to which our shareholders are entitled as investors.
Furthermore, Babylon Shares are not listed and we do not currently intend to list Babylon Shares on any market in the Bailiwick of Jersey, our
country of incorporation. As a result, we are not subject to the reporting and other requirements of companies listed in the Bailiwick of Jersey.
We are a “foreign private issuer.” As such, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain stock exchange corporate governance standards. As
a result, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than shareholders of companies that are subject to all Exchange Act and the NYSE
corporate governance requirements.
As a foreign private issuer, we have the option to follow certain home country corporate governance practices rather than those of the NYSE,
provided that we disclose the requirements we are not following and describe the home country practices we are following. Currently, we intend to follow
certain home country corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise required under the NYSE rules for U.S. issuers, as further disclosed in
“Management Following the Business Combination—Foreign Private Issuer.”
Any foreign private issuer exemptions we avail ourselves of in the future may reduce the scope of information and protection to which you are
otherwise entitled as an investor. As result, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject
to all the NYSE corporate governance requirements. For more information, see “Management Following the Business Combination—Foreign Private
Issuer.”
We may lose our foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional cost and expense.
In order to maintain our current status as a foreign private issuer, either (a) more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities must be either
directly or indirectly owned of record by non-residents of the United States or (b)(i) a majority of our executive officers or directors may not be U.S.
citizens or residents, (ii) more than 50% of our assets cannot be located in the United States and (iii) our business must be administered principally
outside the United States. We expect to lose our foreign private issuer status for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of increased contacts with
the United States. If we lose our foreign private issuer status, we will be required to file with the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S.
domestic issuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. We would also have to mandatorily
comply with U.S. federal proxy requirements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders will become subject to the short-swing profit
disclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we may also be required to make changes in our corporate governance
practices in accordance with various SEC and the NYSE rules. The additional requirements that we would become subject to if we were to lose our foreign
private issuer status could lead us to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses.
Although we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption, we will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE
rules, and we will qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.
Because the Founder will, collectively, own at least a majority of our voting rights following the Closing, we will be considered a “controlled
company” as that term is set forth in the NYSE rules. Under these rules, a
103
Table of Contents
company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a “controlled company” and may
elect not to comply with certain stock exchange rules regarding corporate governance, including:
•
the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;
•
the requirement that its nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written
charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and
•
the requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the
committee’s purpose and responsibilities.
These requirements will not apply to us as long as we remain a “controlled company.” Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not
expect to rely on this exemption and intend to comply with relevant corporate governance requirements under the NYSE. However, if we were to utilize
some or all of these exemptions, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the stock
exchange rules regarding corporate governance.
Our issuance of additional Babylon Class A Shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, or otherwise
will dilute all other shareholders.
We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other shareholders. We expect to grant equity awards to
employees, directors, and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our
business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any
such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause shareholders to experience significant dilution of their
ownership interests and the per share value of our Babylon Class A Shares to decline.
We will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to
compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.
As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, which we expect to
further increase after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public
companies. Our management and other personnel are not experienced in managing a public company and will be required to devote a substantial amount
of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make
some activities more time-consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the
specific timing of such costs.
Some of our management team has limited experience managing a public company.
Members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and
complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage us as a
public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny
of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert
their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if our remediation of such material weaknesses is not
effective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to
produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.
We will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year that coincides with the filing of our second annual report on
Form 20-F. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial
reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting in our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
In connection with the audits of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we identified certain control deficiencies
in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses specifically resulted from (i) lack of documented
evidence for management review controls related to areas of significant judgment and estimation uncertainty and non-routine transactions and (ii)
insufficient segregation of duties and management oversight. We are in the process of designing and implementing measures to improve our internal
control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses related to our financial reporting as of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.
This includes implementing timelier review procedures within our accounting and finance department and hiring additional accounting resources.
Specifically, we have identified that we lack timely, documented evidence of management review controls related to areas of significant judgment
and estimation uncertainty and non-routine transactions and that we have insufficient segregation of duties and evidence of management oversight to
support the implementation and execution of some of our controls.
We are in the process of designing and implementing measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material
weaknesses related to its financial reporting as of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. This includes implementing additional, timelier, review
procedures within our accounting and finance department and hiring additional accounting resources. At the time of this proxy statement/prospectus,
these material weaknesses have not been remediated.
While we are designing and implementing measures to remediate the material weaknesses, we cannot predict the success of such measures or the
outcome of our assessment of these measures at this time. We can give no assurance that these measures will remediate either of the deficiencies in
internal control or that additional material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to
implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that may lead to a restatement
of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If a material weakness was identified and we are unable to assert that its
internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to
express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and
completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Ordinary Shares could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or
investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.
105
Table of Contents
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS and our key metrics require management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and amounts reported in our key metrics. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section
titled “Babylon’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The results of these estimates form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to
allowance for doubtful accounts, assessment of the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, fair value of guarantees included in revenue
arrangements, fair values of stock-based awards, warrants, contingent consideration, and income taxes. Our results of operations may be adversely
affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall
below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of Babylon Shares.
U.S. holders that directly or indirectly own 10% or more of our equity interests may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences under
rules applicable to U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations.
A non-U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “CFC”), if “10% U.S.
equityholders” (as defined below) own, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 50% of either (i) the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of such corporation entitled to vote or (ii) the total value of the stock of such corporation. We do not believe that Babylon Holdings would be
classified as a CFC at the time of Closing, although CFC status is determined after taking into account complex constructive ownership rules and,
accordingly, there can be no assurance in this regard. However, certain of Babylon Holdings’ non-U.S. subsidiaries may be classified as CFCs (as a result
of the application of certain constructive ownership rules which treat Babylon Holdings’ U.S. subsidiaries as owning the equity of those non-U.S.
subsidiaries), and it is possible that we may be classified as a CFC in the future. The U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. holders who at all
times are not 10% U.S. equityholders would not be affected by the CFC rules. However, a U.S. holder that owns (or is treated as owning, directly,
indirectly or constructively, including by applying certain attribution rules) 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled
to vote or the total value of our equity interests (including equity interests attributable to a deemed exercise of options and convertible debt instruments),
or a “10% U.S. equityholder”, if we were classified as a CFC, would generally be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation on a portion of our
applicable subsidiaries’ earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and our earnings and profits, regardless of whether
such 10% U.S. equityholder receives any actual distributions. In addition, if we were classified as a CFC, a portion of any gains realized on the sale of our
common shares by a 10% U.S. equityholder may be treated as ordinary income. A 10% U.S. equityholder will also be subject to additional U.S. federal
income tax information reporting requirements with respect to our subsidiaries that are classified as CFCs and with respect to us (if we were classified as a
CFC) and substantial penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. We cannot provide any assurances that Babylon will assist U.S. Holders in
determining whether Babylon or any of its subsidiaries are treated as a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or whether any
U.S. Holder is treated as a 10% U.S. equityholder with respect to any of such controlled foreign corporations or furnish to any holder information that
may be necessary to comply with reporting and tax paying obligations if Babylon, or any of its subsidiaries, is treated as a controlled foreign corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the CFC rules and whether such U.S. holder may be a
10% U.S. equityholder for purposes of these rules.
Our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are classified as a “passive foreign investment company.”
106
Table of Contents
A non-U.S. corporation generally will be treated as a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any
taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally based on
an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.
Based on the current and anticipated composition of the income, assets and operations of Babylon and its subsidiaries and certain factual assumptions,
Babylon does not expect to be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year ending December 31, 2021. However, there can be no assurances in this regard,
because PFIC status is determined annually and requires a factual determination that depends on, among other things, the composition of a company’s
income, assets and activities in each taxable year, and can only be made annually after the close of each taxable year, and is thus subject to significant
uncertainty. Furthermore, because the value of our gross assets is likely to be determined in part by reference to our market capitalization, a decline in the
value of our ordinary shares may result in Babylon becoming a PFIC. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for
any taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”)
holds our ordinary shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. Holder. Prospective U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to them. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Tax
Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants—Passive Foreign Investment Company
Rules.”
The Internal Revenue Service may not agree that Babylon should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Although Babylon is incorporated in the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) may assert that it should be treated as a U.S.
corporation (and therefore a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. For U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a corporation is generally considered a U.S. “domestic” corporation (or U.S. tax resident) if it is organized in the United States, and a
corporation is generally considered a “foreign” corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) if it is not a U.S. corporation. Because Babylon is an entity
incorporated in the Bailiwick of Jersey, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874
of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated and foreign tax resident entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S.
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
As more fully described in the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon
—Tax Residence of Babylon for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes,” based on the terms of the Business Combination and certain factual assumptions,
Babylon is not currently expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code after the
Business Combination. However, the application of Section 7874 of the Code is complex and is subject to detailed regulations (the application of which is
uncertain in various respects and would be impacted by changes in such U.S. Treasury regulations with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to
certain factual uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the status of Babylon as a foreign corporation under
Section 7874 of the Code or that such challenge would not be sustained by a court.
If the IRS were to successfully challenge under Section 7874 of the Code Babylon’s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Babylon and certain Babylon shareholders would be subject to significant adverse tax consequences, including a higher effective corporate
income tax rate on Babylon and future withholding taxes on certain Babylon shareholders, depending on the application of any income tax treaty that
might apply to reduce such withholding taxes.
See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon—Tax Residence of Babylon for U.S.
Federal Income Tax Purposes” for a more detailed discussion of the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination. Investors in
Babylon should consult their own advisors regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination.

Section 7874 of the Code may limit the ability of Alkuri to use certain tax attributes following the Business Combination, increase Babylon’s U.S.
affiliates’ U.S. taxable income or have other adverse consequences to Babylon and Babylon’s shareholders.
Following the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S.
Following the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S.
corporation and its U.S. affiliates to use U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. taxable income resulting
from certain transactions, as well as result in certain other adverse tax consequences, even if the acquiring foreign corporation is respected as a
foreign corporation for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code. In general, if a foreign corporation acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation and after the acquisition, the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least
60% (by either vote or value) but less than 80% (by vote and value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the
acquired U.S. corporation, subject to other requirements, certain adverse tax consequences under Section 7874 of the Code may apply.
If these rules apply to the Business Combination, Babylon and certain of Babylon’s shareholders may be subject to adverse tax consequences
including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of tax attributes with respect to “inversion gain” recognized over a 10-year period following the
transaction, disqualification of dividends paid from preferential “qualified dividend income” rates and the requirement that any U.S. corporation owned
by Babylon include as “base erosion payments” that may be subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax any amounts treated as reductions in gross
income paid to certain related foreign persons. Furthermore, certain “disqualified individuals” (including officers and directors of a U.S. corporation) may
be subject to an excise tax on certain stock-based compensation held thereby at a rate of 20%.
As more fully described in the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon
—Utilization of Alkuri’s Tax Attributes and Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to Babylon and Babylon’s Shareholders,” based on the terms of
the Business Combination and certain factual assumptions, Babylon is not currently expected to be subject to these rules under Section 7874 of the Code
after the Business Combination.
However, even if Babylon is not subject to the above adverse consequences under Section 7874, Babylon may be limited in using its equity to
engage in future acquisitions of U.S. corporations over a 36-month period following the Business Combination. If Babylon were to be treated as acquiring
substantially all of the assets of a U.S. corporation or U.S. partnership within a 36-month period after the Business Combination, the Section 7874
Regulations would exclude certain shares of Babylon attributable to the Business Combination for purposes of determining the Section 7874 Percentage
of that subsequent acquisition, making it more likely that Section 7874 of the Code will apply to such subsequent acquisition.
See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon—Utilization of Alkuri’s Tax Attributes
and Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to Babylon and Babylon’s Shareholders” for a more detailed discussion of the application of Section 7874
of the Code to the Business Combination. Investors in Babylon should consult their own advisors regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code
to the Business Combination.
Risks Related to Our Incorporation in Jersey
Your rights and responsibilities as a shareholder will be governed by Jersey law, which differs in some material respects with respect to the rights and
responsibilities of shareholders of U.S. companies.
Babylon is organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast
of Normandy, France. Jersey is not a member of the European Union. Jersey legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law
principles. The rights and responsibilities of the holders of our ordinary shares will be governed by the Babylon Articles and by Jersey
108
Table of Contents
law, including the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some material respects from the rights and
responsibilities of shareholders in U.S. corporations.
In particular, Jersey law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of companies may bring derivative actions and, in most
cases, only the corporation may be the proper claimant or plaintiff for the purposes of maintaining proceedings in respect of any wrongful act committed
against it. Neither an individual nor any group of shareholders has any right of action in such circumstances. Jersey law also does not afford appraisal
rights to dissenting shareholders in the form typically available to shareholders of a U.S. corporation.
See “Comparison of Rights of Babylon Shareholders and Alkuri Stockholders” in this proxy statement/prospectus for a description of the
principal differences between the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law applicable to us and the DGCL relating to shareholders’ rights and protections.
However, there can be no assurance that Jersey law will not change in the future or that it will serve to protect the investors in a similar fashion afforded
under corporate law principles in the United States, which could adversely affect the rights of investors.
It may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us or our directors and officers outside the United States, or to assert U.S. securities law claims
outside of the United States.
A number of our directors and executive officers are not residents of the United States, and the majority of our assets and the assets of these
persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for investors to effect service of process upon us within the
United States or other jurisdictions, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.
Investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the United States, including Jersey, for
liabilities under the securities laws of the United States. The Babylon Articles will provide that, unless Babylon consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Courts of Jersey shall (to the fullest extent permitted by law) be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions,
actions for breach of fiduciary duty by Babylon directors and officers, actions arising out of Jersey Companies Law or actions arising out of or in
connection with the Babylon Articles (pursuant to any provisions of Jersey law) or otherwise relating to the constitution or conduct of the company
itself (other than any such action of the company that may arise out of a breach of any federal law of the United States or the laws of any U.S. state). The
exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in
a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims. In addition, unless the company consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, U.S federal district courts shall be the sole and exclusive form for any resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act.
Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions will benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of U.S. federal
securities laws and the laws of Jersey in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, these provisions may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a
judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, shareholders, officers, or others, or may increase the cost of doing so, both of
which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provision. Further, in the event a court finds the exclusive
forum provisions contained in the Babylon Articles to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with
resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.

special meeting of Alkuri Stockholders and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with information
you need to know to be able to vote or instruct your vote to be cast at the special meeting.
Date, Time and Place of Special Meeting of Alkuri’s Stockholders
The special meeting will be held on October 20, 2021, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, solely over the Internet by means of a live audio webcast. You may
attend the special meeting webcast by accessing the web portal located at https://www.cstproxy.com/alkuriglobal/2021 and following the instructions set
forth on your proxy card.
Purpose of the Alkuri Special Meeting
At the special meeting, Alkuri is asking its stockholders:
1.
Proposal No. 1—The Business Combination Proposal—to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, and the
transactions contemplated therein, including the Business Combination;
2.
Proposal No. 2—The Equity Plan Proposal—to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the 2021 Plan, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C;
3.
Proposal No. 3—The Adjournment Proposal—to consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to
a later date or dates, if necessary, if the parties are not able to consummate the Business Combination.
Recommendation of Alkuri Board of Directors
Alkuri’s board of directors has determined that each of the proposals outlined above is fair to and in the best interests of Alkuri and its
stockholders and recommended that Alkuri Stockholders vote “FOR” the Business Combination Proposal, “FOR” the Equity Plans Proposal and “FOR”
the Adjournment Proposal, if presented.
Record Date; Persons Entitled to Vote
Alkuri Stockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the special meeting if they owned shares of Alkuri Common Stock at the
close of business on September 14, 2021, which is the record date for the special meeting. Stockholders will have one vote for each share of Alkuri
Common Stock owned at the close of business on the record date. If your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you
should contact your broker, bank or nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. Alkuri’s warrants do
not have voting rights. On the record date, there were 12,792,156 shares of Alkuri Common Stock outstanding, of which 4,167,156 were Alkuri public
shares.
Quorum
A quorum is the minimum number of shares of Alkuri Common Stock that must be present to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present at the
Alkuri special meeting if a majority of all the outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock entitled to vote at the meeting are represented at the virtual
special meeting or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will count as present for the purposes of establishing a quorum. The Alkuri Class A
Common Stock and Alkuri Class B Common Stock are entitled vote together as a single class on all matters to be considered at the special meeting.
113Table of Contents
Vote Required
The proposals to be presented at the special meeting will require the following votes:
Business Combination Proposal — The approval of the Business Combination Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “against” the
Business Combination Proposal. Brokers are not entitled to vote on the Business Combination Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial
holder and, consequently, broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “against” the Business Combination Proposal. The Transactions will not
be consummated if Alkuri has less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act) either
immediately prior to or upon consummation of the Transactions.
Equity Plan Proposal — The approval of the Equity Plan Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Alkuri Common Stock present and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “against” the Equity
Plan Proposal. Brokers are entitled to vote on the Equity Plan Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder because the proposal is
considered “routine.” Consequently, there should be no broker non-votes with respect to the Equity Plan Proposal.
Adjournment Proposal — The approval of the Adjournment Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Alkuri Common Stock present and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “against” the Adjournment
Proposal. Brokers are entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder because the proposal is
considered “routine.” Consequently, there should be no broker non-votes with respect to the Adjournment Proposal.
Voting Your Shares
If you are a holder of record of Alkuri Common Stock, there are two ways to vote your shares of Alkuri Common Stock at the special meeting:
•
By Mail. You may vote by proxy by completing the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid return envelope. If you vote by
proxy card, your “proxy,” whose name is listed on the proxy card, will vote your shares as you instruct on the proxy card. If you sign and
return the proxy card but do not give instructions on how to vote your shares, your shares will be voted “FOR” all of the proposals in
accordance with the recommendation of the Alkuri board of directors. Proxy cards received after a matter has been voted upon at the special
meeting will not be counted.
•
In Person. You may attend the special meeting webcast and vote electronically using the ballot provided to you during the webcast. You
may attend the special meeting webcast by accessing the web portal located at https://www.cstproxy.com/alkuriglobal/2021 and following

How do I attend the special meeting?” for more information.
Revoking Your Proxy
If you are a holder of record of Alkuri Common Stock and you give a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by doing any one of
the following:
•
you may send another proxy card to Alkuri’s secretary with a later date so that it is received prior to the vote at the special meeting or attend
the live webcast of the special meeting and vote electronically;
•
you may notify Alkuri’s secretary in writing, prior to the vote at the special meeting, that you have revoked your proxy; or
114
Table of Contents
•
you may attend the live webcast of the special meeting and vote electronically or revoke your proxy electronically, although your
attendance alone will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given.
If you hold your Alkuri Common Stock in “street name,” you may submit new instructions on how to vote your shares by contacting your broker,
bank or other nominee.
Who Can Answer Your Questions About Voting Your Shares
If you are an Alkuri Stockholder and have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares of Alkuri Common Stock, you
may call Continental Stock & Transfer Co., at 1 917-262-2373, or banks and brokers can call at 1 917-262-2373.
Redemption Rights
Pursuant to the SPAC Charter, a holder of Alkuri public shares may demand that Alkuri redeem such shares for cash if the Business Combination is
consummated; provided that Alkuri may not consummate the Business Combination if it has less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets either immediately
prior to or upon consummation of the Business Combination. Holders of Alkuri public shares will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if they
deliver their shares to Alkuri’s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the special meeting. Holders of Alkuri public shares do not need
to affirmatively vote on the Business Combination Proposal or be a holder of such Alkuri public shares as of the record date to exercise redemption
rights. If the Business Combination is not consummated, these shares will not be redeemed for cash. If a holder of Alkuri public shares properly demands
such redemption, delivers his, her or its shares to Alkuri’s transfer agent as described above, and the Business Combination is consummated, Alkuri will
redeem each Alkuri public share into a full pro rata portion of the trust account, calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the date of the special
meeting. It is anticipated that this would amount to approximately $10.00 per share. If a holder of Alkuri public shares exercises his, her or its conversion
rights, then it will be redeeming its shares of Alkuri Common Stock for cash and will not become a shareholder of Babylon.
Alkuri’s Sponsor, officers and directors do not have redemption rights with respect to any Babylon Class A Shares owned by them, directly or
indirectly.
Alkuri requires public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to
Alkuri’s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the vote on the Business Combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent
electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. There is a nominal cost
associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will
typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder.
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination. Furthermore,
if a holder of an Alkuri public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote
on the Business Combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or
electronically).
If the Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then Alkuri Stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights
would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, Alkuri will promptly return any shares
delivered by public holders.

Appraisal Rights
Alkuri Stockholders and holders of Alkuri Warrants do not have appraisal rights in connection with the Transactions under the DGCL.
Proxy Solicitation Costs
Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone or in person. Alkuri has engaged Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies, and it will
pay such firm $37,500 plus disbursements for such services.
Other Matters
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Alkuri board of directors does not know of any business to be presented at the special
meeting other than as set forth in the notice accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus. If any other matters should properly come before the special
meeting, it is intended that the shares represented by proxies will be voted with respect to such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons
voting the proxies.
Interests of Alkuri’s Officers and Directors in the Transactions
In considering the recommendation of Alkuri’s board of directors to vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri
Stockholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and Alkuri’s directors and executive officers have interests in such proposal that are different from, or
in addition to, those of Alkuri Stockholders generally. In particular:
•
If the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such
later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming
100% of the outstanding Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of
directors, dissolving and liquidating. In such event, the Alkuri Securities held by the Sponsor and Alkuri’s directors and officers, which
were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to
participate in any redemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based
upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated,
each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
•
The Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private. This purchase took place on a private
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from these purchases were
placed in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $8,484,666 based upon the closing price of
$1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants had an
aggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The private
placement warrants and the Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants will become worthless if Alkuri does
not consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an
amendment to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each outstanding whole warrant will
become a Babylon warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation of the Business Combination and
each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
•
If Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under certain
circumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the
116
Table of Contents
trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for
services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri consummates a business combination, on the other hand, Alkuri will
be liable for all such claims.
•
The Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them
in connection with certain activities on Alkuri’s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business
combinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have any claim
against the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business Combination
or another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an
amendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri’s officers and directors and their affiliates had incurred
approximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.
•
The Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have agreed
to purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the
other PIPE Investors.
•
Until the first anniversary of Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will
have the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.
•
The Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri’s current directors and officers and the continuation of
directors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri’s current directors and officers.
•
Alkuri’s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the
extent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.
Interests of Babylon Holdings’ Directors and Officers in the Business Combination
In considering the recommendation of Alkuri’s board of directors in favor of the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, stockholders
should keep in mind that Babylon’s directors and officers may have interests in such proposal that are different from, or in addition to, those of Alkuri
Stockholders and warrant holders generally. These interests include, among other things, the interests listed below:
•
Entities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust, Babylon Holdings’ Chief Executive Officer and chairman of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors,
have agreed to purchase 200,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and
conditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth, member of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder
of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’ share capital, and (ii) Georgi Ganev, member of Babylon’s board of directors, and Invik S.A., a
holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’ share capital, have each agreed to purchase 500,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to
Subscription Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.
•
Certain of Babylon Holdings’ directors and executive officers will serve as officers of Babylon following the consummation of the Business
Combination. As such, in the future they will receive any cash or equity-based compensation that the Babylon board determines to pay to
such officers. For additional information, see the section entitled “Management Following the Business Combination.”
•
Dr. Ali Parsadoust will receive the Stockholder Earnout Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For additional information, see the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Earnout.”
117
Table of Contents
Purchases of Alkuri Shares
At any time prior to the special meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding Alkuri or its
securities, the Sponsor, Alkuri’s officers and directors and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares from institutional and other investors who
vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination Proposal, or execute agreements to purchase shares from such investors in the
future, or they may enter into transactions with such investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire shares of Alkuri Common Stock or
vote their shares in favor of the Merger Agreement. The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions may be to increase the likelihood of
satisfaction of the requirements to consummate the Business Combination where it appears that such requirements would otherwise not be met.
While the exact nature of any such arrangements has not been determined as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, they might include,
without limitation, arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their shares, including the granting of put options
and, with Babylon’s consent, the transfer to such investors or holders of shares or warrants owned by the Sponsor for nominal value.
Entering into any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on Alkuri Common Stock. For example, as a result of these arrangements, an
investor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to sell the shares he
owns, either prior to or immediately after the special meeting.
If such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Business Combination to be approved in circumstances where such
approval could not otherwise be obtained. Purchases of shares by the persons described above would allow them to exert more influence over the
approval of the Business Combination Proposal and other proposals and would likely increase the chances that such proposals would be approved. No
agreements dealing with the above arrangements or purchases have been entered into as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.

The following is a discussion of the proposed Business Combination and the Merger Agreement. This is a summary only and may not contain all
of the information that is important to you. This summary is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Merger Agreement, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. Alkuri Stockholders are urged to read this entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully,
including the Merger Agreement, for a more complete understanding of the Business Combination.
General
Transaction Structure
The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Alkuri with and into Merger Sub, with Alkuri surviving the Business Combination as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Babylon.
Pro Forma Capitalization
The pro forma equity valuation of Babylon upon consummation of the Transactions is estimated to approximate $4.2 billion. We estimate that at the
Effective Time without giving effect to the issuance of Earnout Shares and assuming none of Alkuri’s public stockholders demand of their Alkuri public
shares pursuant to the SPAC Charter, the securityholders of Babylon and Babylon’s management will own more than 75% of the outstanding Babylon
Shares and the securityholders of Alkuri, the Sponsor, the Founder, and certain accredited investors purchasing PIPE Shares will own the remaining
Babylon Shares. At Closing, the Founder will own all outstanding shares of Babylon Class B Shares.
Merger Consideration
The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon at $3.515 billion. Prior to the
Closing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of Babylon Holdings will be reclassified into Babylon Class A Shares,
other than the Babylon
119Table of Contents
Holdings Class A Shares, which will be reclassified as Babylon Class B Shares. As a result of the Reclassification, each outstanding Babylon Class A
Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00 (based on the $3.515 billion equity value of Babylon
Holdings). At the Closing, the Babylon Class B Shares will be held by the Founder. The Babylon Class B Shares will have the same economic terms as the
Babylon Class A Shares, but the Babylon Class B Shares will have 15 votes per share (while each Babylon Class A Share will have one vote per share).
Ownership of Babylon after the Business Combination
It is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri’s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the Babylon
Shares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon; (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power
of Babylon; (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Earnout Shares) and
0.6% of the voting power of Babylon; and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the Babylon Shares and
95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon being held by the
Founder. These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately
following the Business Combination; (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata
portion of the funds in Alkuri’s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing also excludes shares being
purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE
Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon assuming no
redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon assuming maximum redemptions.
Background of the Business Combination
The terms of the Business Combination are the result of negotiations between the representatives of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings. The following
is a brief description of the background of these negotiations and the resulting Business Combination.
Alkuri is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December 1, 2020 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Alkuri’s intention was to
capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of its management team and advisors in order to identify and combine with
one or more businesses in the disruptive technology sector broadly with a spotlight on Consumer Internet and Marketplaces, Healthtech, Fintech and
Mobility.
On February 9, 2021, Alkuri consummated its initial public offering (taken together with the underwriter’s full exercise of the over-allotment option)
of 34,500,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one warrant, generating total gross
proceeds of $345,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of
$25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri’s IPO and the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of which entitles the holder to purchase one share
of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of approximately
$8,900,000.
Prior to the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, neither Alkuri, nor anyone on its behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or
indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with Alkuri.
120
Table of Contents
After the Alkuri IPO, Alkuri’s officers, advisors and directors commenced an active search for prospective businesses or assets to acquire in its
initial business combination. Representatives from the Alkuri management team contacted, and were contacted by, numerous individuals, financial
advisors and other entities who offered to present ideas for business combination opportunities. In addition, certain Alkuri advisors and directors also
identified potential business combination candidates for Alkuri.
In light of the volume of potential partners to a business combination (including Babylon Holdings, the “Potential Targets”) with whom Alkuri had
an opportunity to engage in discussions, the Alkuri management team commenced standing weekly update calls with the Alkuri board of directors on
February 26, 2021.
Between February 2021 and April 2021, Alkuri engaged in discussions, including at least one meeting, with forty Potential Targets. The industries
in which these Potential Targets operated included the following: Healthcare, Consumer Internet/Ecommerce, Financial Services Technology, Enterprise
Software and Clean Energy Technology.
Of these Potential Targets that Alkuri met with at least one time, Alkuri also:
•
Entered into non-disclosure agreements with 24 such Potential Targets (including Babylon Holdings);
•
Received management presentations or confidential information memorandums from twenty Potential Targets (including Babylon Holdings);
•
Fielded two meetings with three Potential Targets;
•
Fielded three to four meetings with an additional seven Potential Targets;
•
Fielded over six meetings with an additional four Potential Targets (including Babylon Holdings);
•
Obtained access to a virtual dataroom, and conducted additional due diligence of varying degrees, with respect to eleven Potential Targets
(including Babylon Holdings); and
•
Provided a letter of intent with respect to a business combination to three Potential Targets (one in the Consumer Internet/Ecommerce
sector, one in the Enterprise Software sector and Babylon Holdings).
Following such reviews, and at various points in time, these discussions with Potential Targets (other than Babylon Holdings) were discontinued
for one or various reasons, including the maturity of the business, the lack of a near-term path to profitability, the valuation of the Potential Target, the
strength of the management team of the Potential Target, and the lack of competitive advantages or sufficient barriers to entries for the Potential Target.
With respect to one of the two Potential Targets (other than Babylon Holdings) that had progressed to the stage where Alkuri presented a letter of intent,
although Babylon and the Potential Target exchanged a few drafts of the letter of intent with certain transaction terms, discussions were ultimately
discontinued before a letter of intent was entered into with Babylon Holdings because of Alkuri’s belief that the valuation expectations of the Potential
Target were too high to justify further discussion. With respect to the second Potential Target (other than Babylon Holdings) that had progressed to the
stage where Alkuri presented a letter of intent, although Babylon and the Potential Target exchanged a few drafts of the letter of intent with certain
transaction terms, discussions were discontinued for the reasons described below in connection with Alkuri’s decision to enter into a letter of intent with
Babylon Holdings (the “LOI”).
On March 10, 2021, Dominic Lester and a team of European based investment bankers at Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), in the course of representing
Babylon Holdings in relation to a possible business combination, contacted Alkuri in order to determine whether Alkuri would be willing to explore a
potential business combination with Babylon Holdings. The Jefferies team indicated their belief that Alkuri’s experience in global operations, hyper-
scaling and healthcare technology, could allow Alkuri to offer a differentiating level of expertise for Babylon Holdings while also providing Alkuri’s
stockholders with a compelling value creation
121
Table of Contents
opportunity. During this meeting, Alkuri was provided background on Babylon’s business, management team and competitive position.
On March 12, 2021, Alkuri held internal conversations (including with a Jefferies team advising Alkuri based in the United States and led by Guarav
Kittur and Jeffrey Snyder) in order to consider the prospects for a potential business combination with Babylon Holdings. Prior to such meeting, Jefferies
had put customary insulation wall-procedures in place to prevent the U.S. team from communicating with the team led by Mr. Lester regarding Babylon
Holdings or otherwise accessing information regarding Babylon Holdings. Members of the Alkuri team were familiar with the Babylon Holdings brand,
and had previously worked with select members of Babylon Holdings US-based management team in previous roles at unrelated companies, however the
Alkuri team had not met with or engaged Babylon Holdings management or executives prior to these internal conversations.
On March 15, 2021, Alkuri entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Babylon Holdings and subsequently received access to the data room in
order to facilitate Alkuri’s due diligence review of Babylon Holdings. The non-disclosure agreement did not include a standstill.
On March 16, 2021, Alkuri held a follow-up conversation with a team of investment bankers led by Dominic Lester, during which Alkuri was
afforded an opportunity to ask additional questions with respect to Babylon Holdings and the proposed process related to a potential business
combination.
On March 17, 2021, members of Babylon Holdings’ management met with Alkuri in order to provide Alkuri with a management presentation on the
Babylon Holdings business.
On March 19, 2021, Rich Williams and Dr. Ali Parsadoust, spoke directly in order to familiarize themselves with each other, their goals and the
respective teams at Alkuri and Babylon Holdings. In addition, the call included a high-level discussion of enterprise value to revenue multiples (“EV-Rev
multiple”) attributed to well-known and slower growth peer companies of Babylon Holdings, which Dr. Ali Parsadoust indicated ranged between 10-15x
revenue, with some companies trading even higher despite more limited services and capabilities than those offered by Babylon Holdings.
In parallel with the foregoing discussions, Alkuri directed the Jefferies U.S. team to conduct a valuation analysis based on comparable companies
of Babylon Holdings, the first draft of which was delivered to Alkuri on March 22, 2021. This analysis consisted of the Selected Peer Companies. The
analysis demonstrated: (i) 2021 EV-Rev multiples ranging from 10.5x to 32.3x, with a median of 15.5x, and (ii) 2022 EV-Rev multiples ranging from 6.7x to
22.2x, with a median of 11.1x. Viewing 2021 and 2022 data showed the Selected Peer Companies growing at a median below 40% and a 2020-2022
Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) median of 39.6%, compared to Babylon Holdings’ projected 3-year CAGR of approximately 200%. As a result,
the analysis demonstrated that the valuation ranges presented by Dr. Ali Parsadoust were well within the bounds of then current market data and
trending toward the lower-end of the valuation ranges. Accordingly, Alkuri believed that, subject to obtaining diligence comfort on Babylon Holdings’
ability to execute on 2021 and 2022 revenue projections, a potential business combination with Babylon Holdings presented a strong potential for
outsized returns to Alkuri Stockholders.
Between March 23, 2021 and March 26, 2021, Alkuri engaged in a series of diligence meetings with Babylon Holdings and its representatives in
order to, among other things, better understand Babylon Holdings’ operations, financial model, products and technology.
In parallel, multiple discussions were held in order to better understand Babylon Holdings’ expectations on material terms in connection with any
potential business combination. These parallel discussions included a call on March 24, 2021 between Rich Williams and Dr. Ali Parsadoust. Although
there was little discussion with respect to either parties’ specific expectations in regard to valuation, during this call Mr. Williams articulated his
122
Table of Contents
thematic focus on deal certainty and pricing an initial business combination in a manner that was fair to all parties (including, in particular, to Alkuri
Stockholders) and that would create what Alkuri Stockholders and other prospective investors would ideally see as an attractive investment opportunity
that held the potential to generate outsized returns and long-term value creation. Additional high-level discussion also included concepts such as post-
closing consideration structures (such as an earnout), post-closing governance matters, exclusivity, process and timing related to any potential business
combination. The representatives of Babylon Holdings also proposed to continue the super-voting rights of Dr. Parsadoust as part of the post-closing
governance provisions.
Following such initial business diligence and high-level discussions with respect to business expectations for any potential business combination,
on March 26, 2021, Alkuri provided Babylon Holdings with a first draft of the LOI. This first draft of the LOI ascribed a closing enterprise valuation to
Babylon Holdings of $3.078 billion. In addition, as a result of feedback provided during the call on March 24, 2021, Alkuri included a post-closing earnout
opportunity for Babylon’s shareholders and agreed to subject a portion of the Sponsor shares to an earnout in its first draft of the LOI. The earnout
opportunity for Babylon’s shareholders contemplated additional consideration to be provided in the form of 30,776,875 additional shares that vested in
two equal tier earnout tranches when Babylon Shares trade above $15 and $20, respectively for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. In the LOI, the
Sponsor also agreed to subject 15% of its existing shares to the same earnout vesting schedule Alkuri proposed these economic terms in order to, among
other things, de-risk Babylon Holdings’ performance against its projections, particularly in light of the early stage of Alkuri’s diligence on Babylon
Holdings’ revenue pipeline that supported its projections. Specifically, Alkuri believed that setting closing consideration toward the low end of valuation
ranges of the Selected Peer Companies would provide an important protection to its stockholders in the event that Babylon Shares failed to trade-up in
line with expectations (including because Babylon Holdings failed to execute in full against its projections). On the other hand, a meaningful earnout
opportunity provided a reward to Babylon executives who participate in the long-term incentive plan to be adopted by Babylon Holdings in connection
with the Business Combination in an upside scenario where Babylon traded toward the higher end of the valuation range, while also creating a
meaningful economic incentive for these Babylon executives to perform (or over perform) against its projections.
On March 29, 2021, representatives from Alkuri, the Jefferies team with whom Alkuri was working, Babylon Holdings, Winston & Strawn LLP,
Alkuri’s legal counsel (“Winston”) and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Babylon Holdings’ legal counsel (“WSGR”) held a video conference meeting
to discuss high-level terms of a potential business combination between Alkuri and Babylon Holdings and a possible timeline for such business
combination.
Also, on March 29, 2021, Babylon Holdings indicated its desire for Alkuri to enter into non-disclosure agreements with select potential investors in
order to assess the strength of interest in a potential business combination between Alkuri and Babylon Holdings, including the willingness of such
investors to participate in a private placement fundraise (the “PIPE Investment”) in connection with such potential business combination.
Between March 29, 2021 and April 7, 2021, Alkuri entered into non-disclosure agreements with, and previewed the potential business combination
for, eight prospective investors in the PIPE Investment.
Throughout the course of these discussions, the Alkuri management team worked with the Jefferies U.S. team to continue work on the valuation
analysis of Babylon Holdings. As part of this work, Alkuri and its advisors looked at the Selected Peer Companies in order to both understand a broader
range of potential trading outcomes and investor sentiment in related categories. This work included reviewing the Selected Peer Companies, which were
not viewed as being direct peers by the Alkuri management team or Jefferies. The Alkuri management team believed the group of Selected Peer companies
consisted of a variety of companies at divergent ends of the valuation spectrum. This broader review was conducted because Alkuri management and
Jefferies believed that reviewing and understanding a broader range of data would help them to better understand potential value ranges, the factors
driving divergent valuation outcomes and, as a result, focus diligence efforts on key valuation drivers. Based on this broader review, Alkuri believed that
key differentiators for Babylon Holdings that would need to be confirmed as part of the diligence process included the sustainability of its
123
Table of Contents
historic growth into the future, the diversification of its business model and comparatively strong margins and/or revenue scale. Additionally, while this
broader review resulted in slightly lower median 2021 EV-Rev multiples of 11.1x and 2022 EV-Rev multiples of 7x, it also lowered median growth rates to
below 35%. As a result, Alkuri management believed the Selected Peer Companies, confirmed that the valuation ranges under discussion with Babylon
Holdings (as detailed below) remained a meaningful discount to median EV-Rev multiples, while increasing the growth disparity between Babylon
Holdings and the Selected Peer Companies. Accordingly, Alkuri continued to believe that a potential business combination with Babylon Holdings
presented the potential for outsized returns to its stockholders.
From March 26, 2021 through April 7, 2021, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings also continued active negotiations with respect to the terms of the LOI.
The focus of the negotiations on the LOI related to, among other things, the enterprise value ascribed to Babylon Holdings, share price vesting
thresholds for the Stockholder Earnout Shares and the post-closing governance terms of Babylon Holdings, including the super-voting rights.
During the course of these negotiations and based on requests from Babylon Holdings, closing enterprise valuation was increased from $3.078
billion to $3.5 billion, the number of Earnout Shares to be made available to Babylon executives was increased from 30,7776,875 shares to 40,000,000
shares (which were ultimately divided into 38,800,000 Stockholder Earnout Shares to be issued to the Founder and 1,200,000 awards to be issued to other
Babylon executives (rather than all of the Babylon shareholders) under a long-term incentive plan to be adopted by Babylon Holdings in connection with
the Business Combination), additional share price vesting tiers for when the Earnout Shares trade above $12.50 and $17.50, respectively, for 20 out of 30
consecutive trading days, were added to the two originally proposed trading price thresholds by Alkuri (of $15 and $20) and the post-closing ratio to be
attributed to the “high-vote” shares to be received by the Founder was increased from a 10 to 1 ratio to a 15 to 1 ratio because such “high-vote” shares
would only be received in respect of the existing Babylon Holdings Class A ordinary shares (which are “high-vote” shares) which represents some, but
not all, of the shares of Babylon Holdings held by the Founder.
The increase in the closing enterprise valuation was agreed to by Alkuri due to a number of factors, including:
•
Indications from Babylon Holdings’ board of directors was expecting a valuation in the high $3 billions and would not accept anything less
than $3.5 billion;
•
As a result of increasing visibility into, and comfort with, the prospect pipeline supporting Babylon Holdings’ forecasted 2022 revenue
projections of approximately $710 million; and
•
In light of Alkuri’s belief that, based on its valuation work in consultation with Jefferies, the increased closing enterprise valuation
continued to represent a meaningful discount to comparable median valuations.
The increase in the earnout opportunity was agreed to by Alkuri because it believed that the total economics of the deal continued to represent a
meaningful discount to the valuations of the Selected Peer Companies, particularly in light of its increasing visibility into, and comfort with, the prospect
pipeline supporting Babylon Holdings’ forecasted 2022 revenue projections. Alkuri also agreed to the additional share priced vesting tiers because, while
it might make the earnout more likely to be achieved in part, it would continue to incentivize management participants in the long-term incentive plan
described above in scenarios where one or both of the tiers in Alkuri’s original proposal (of $15 and $20) were unlikely to be achieved, but the Babylon
Shares were nonetheless trading at a range that represented an outsized return to Alkuri Stockholders. In addition, Alkuri also believed that the additional
share priced vesting tiers might be beneficial to stock price performance because having four tiers (rather than two) at which the earnout vested on a
ratable basis, may help to alleviate or reduce any trading overhang that might result from two larger vesting tiers (with half of the consideration vesting at
each tier).
The post-closing super-voting governance structure was agreed upon by Alkuri due to the existing governance terms held by the Founder
(including shares that then currently provided him super-voting powers)
124
Table of Contents
and in order to provide stability and allow the management team to focus on long-term shareholder value creation during an expected period of sustained
accelerated growth and expansion.
While Alkuri continued to field weekly update calls with the board of directors of Alkuri throughout this process, Alkuri also held a special meeting
of the board of directors on the morning of April 7, 2021 in order to review the status of discussions with, and work completed on, Babylon Holdings. At
this special meeting it was determined that Alkuri should proceed to enter into an LOI with Babylon Holdings that contained mutual exclusivity
obligations and, accordingly, discontinue discussions with the other Potential Target with whom discussions were ongoing on a letter of intent. This
determination was made, among other things, based on Babylon Holdings’ size, highly differentiated growth profile, a belief that Babylon Holdings’
position was more defensible in its marketplace, more established and predictable operations and financial profile (including over the prior two years
where Babylon Holdings had delivered on significant growth), visibility and confidence with respect to Babylon Holdings’ ability to continue delivering
accelerated growth compared to the Selected Peer Companies which were trading at meaningfully higher revenue multiples and the willingness of
Babylon Holdings’ shareholders and the request of Alkuri to “roll” all of their equity in the potential business combination (and forego the opportunity to
receive cash consideration).
Later in the day on April 7, 2021, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings entered into an LOI, with mutual exclusivity running through April 30, 2021. Babylon
Holdings required exclusivity given the costs and resources they were going to devote to the potential business combination and Alkuri believed that
the relatively short exclusivity period would provide adequate opportunity for Alkuri to conduct further diligence and begin the process of negotiating
definitive transaction documents, and if necessary abandon the transaction and pursue alternative business combination targets if there were any issues
uncovered that in Alkuri’s view would cause Alkuri to rethink the valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings in the LOI. This exclusivity period was
ultimately extended multiple times to June 4, 2021.
On April 12, 2021, Alkuri formally engaged Jefferies as its financial advisor in order to, among other things, provide financial advice on the potential
business combination with Babylon Holdings, assist Alkuri in requesting and analyzing due diligence information received from Babylon Holdings,
review financial information of Babylon Holdings, develop presentations for the Alkuri board of directors and provide other customary financial advisory
and investment banking services. Alkuri selected Jefferies in part because of its pre-existing relationship with Jefferies (who had previously acted as the
underwriter for the Alkuri IPO), the likelihood of being able to obtain favorable economic terms from Jefferies (due to Jefferies having acted as the
underwriter for the Alkuri IPO) and Jefferies’ extensive experience in healthcare and technology.
On April 12, 2021, Alkuri retained Jefferies to act as lead left placement agent on the PIPE Investment. At the request of Babylon Holdings, Alkuri
also retained Citi as an additional non-lead placement agent on the PIPE Investment in order to, among other things, ensure that Babylon Holdings had
direct visibility into the PIPE Investment process. Babylon Holdings had previously retained Ardea and Citi as its financial advisors in connection with
the merger, which will receive $7,500,000 and $4,000,000, respectively, and any additional amount at Babylon Holdings’ discretion in fees for their
respective involvement in such transactions.
Also, on April 12, 2021, despite having previously operated under insulation walls between the Jefferies’ team advising Alkuri and the team
advising Babylon Holdings, Jefferies formally withdrew from its pre-existing representation of Babylon Holdings in order to avoid the appearance of
impropriety or a conflict of interest.
On or about April 12, 2021, Alkuri began the process of formally wall-crossing certain prospective investors in the PIPE Investment (in addition to
the eight prospective investors discussed above that were previously brought-in by Alkuri under a non-disclosure agreement in order to consider the
potential business combination with Babylon Holdings).
On April 16, 2021, in addition to the weekly meetings that, for the most part, continued to be held by Alkuri management with the board of directors
of Alkuri, at the request of the independent directors of Alkuri (i.e.,
125
Table of Contents
Stephen Smith, Jason Harinstein and Katie May), Winston fielded a separate call with the independent directors of Alkuri. This meeting was requested by
the independent directors in order to obtain Winston’s guidance on how best to oversee the work of Alkuri’s management and advisors and to carry-out
and execute their duties as fiduciaries of the Alkuri Stockholders. During this call, the independent directors also discussed the diligence process to date
and the diligence process that would be conducted prior to the entry into any definitive agreements in respect of the potential business combination with
Babylon Holdings.
During the months of April and early May, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings (together with their respective advisors) engaged in a series of
discussions regarding the considerations on the structuring of the potential business combination, including with respect to tax implications with respect
thereto. During the course of these discussions, various structuring options were proposed and considered by the parties, including structures that
might provide Alkuri Stockholders with more certain tax treatments. However, following thorough exploration of these various structuring alternatives,
Babylon Holdings indicated that it viewed the alternative structures as problematic from a tax perspective and was, therefore, unwilling to proceed with
the potential business combination on the basis of any structure other than that contemplated by the ultimate structure provided for in the Merger
Agreement. Further, during the course of these discussions, various structuring options were proposed and considered by the parties with regard to the
Earnout Shares and various terms and provisions were proposed and considered with respect to the dual class structure. After considering the various
options, the parties agreed upon the structure and terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement and Babylon Articles.
Also during the months of April and May, members of the Alkuri management team together with its advisors (including Jefferies, Winston,
Sheppard Mullin, Alkuri’s healthcare and regulatory counsel (“Sheppard”), Cary Olsen Jersey LLP, Alkuri’s local counsel in Jersey, and Moss Adams LLP,
Alkuri’s tax, accounting and financial advisors (“Moss Adams”), Barrington Advisory Group, Alkuri’s strategic, process and financial advisor
(“Barrington”) and other advisors of Alkuri reviewing the business, product and technology of Babylon Holdings) engaged in a review of due diligence
materials provided with respect to Babylon Holdings, held telephonic conferences and virtual meetings with the Babylon Holdings management team and
their representatives in order to discuss commercial, regulatory, tax, legal and other elements of Babylon Holdings’ business and future prospects. During
this time, Alkuri’s management team and advisors also provided supplemental diligence requests based on the materials provided and the discussions
during such virtual meetings and received supplemental requests from Babylon Holdings in response.
Following completion of preliminary due diligence and preliminary structuring discussions, it was determined that Alkuri would provide the first
draft of the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, on May 4, 2021, Winston sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to WSGR so that the Merger
Agreement could be advanced in parallel with completion of structuring discussions, the PIPE Investment and Alkuri’s due diligence. WSGR responded
with revised drafts on May 9, 2021 and an updated revised draft on May 12, 2021.
Starting May 10, 2021, the leadership of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings (and, to the extent necessary, relevant advisors from each company), began
holding daily update calls. During the course of these calls the leadership teams updated each other on process, open items and responsibilities.
Commencing on May 14, 2021 through the signing of the Merger Agreement, Alkuri invited certain of its external advisors to join weekly update
calls with the Alkuri board of directors, in order to update the Alkuri board of directors on the status of negotiations with respect to the Merger
Agreement and the results of due diligence.
The parties held a call on May 17, 2021, involving members of the Alkuri and the Babylon Holdings management team, along with representatives
from Winston and WSGR in order to discuss material issues remaining in the Merger Agreement, which included deal certainty for Alkuri with respect to
shareholder approvals and support arrangements to be delivered by shareholders of Babylon Holdings at or prior to signing,
126
Table of Contents
allocation of risk in the representations and warranties and the covenants of each party, including the ability of the Alkuri board of directors to change its
recommendation to its stockholders to the extent required by law and Babylon Holdings’ obligations with respect to post-closing tax filings.
On May 19, 2021, Winston provided WSGR with an updated draft of the Merger Agreement. Thereafter, the parties continued to negotiate the
Merger Agreement, other ancillary documents and the disclosures schedules to the Merger Agreement.
In parallel with Alkuri’s due diligence and the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, commencing on April 16 and extending through May 18, Alkuri
and Babylon Holdings, with assistance from Jefferies, Citi and Pareto conducted over 65 investor meetings with potential investors. Commitments from
subscribers in the aggregate amount of $230 million were obtained from investors (including $13 million in the aggregate from Alkuri’s Chairman, CEO,
CFO and the Sponsor). In parallel with these discussions and the negotiations of the Merger Agreement, the parties negotiated with prospective PIPE
Investors the terms of their investment. Among the points negotiated for by the PIPE investors was the inclusion of a condition with respect to the
funding by each of the other PIPE Investors. Because this construct did not allow flexibility in the event any of the PIPE investors defaulted on their
commitment, Babylon Holdings and Alkuri negotiated for a reduction in this commitment to $210 million in funding by the PIPE Investors (assuming full
funding by the applicable subscriber), which provided the parties with $20 million in flexibility in the event of failures to fund (in whole or in part) by one
or more PIPE Investors.
On May 31, 2021, the Alkuri board of directors held a special meeting to consider the terms of the Merger Agreement and the other definitive
agreements contemplated thereby. At this meeting, Winston advised the members of the Alkuri board of directors of their fiduciary duties and
summarized the material transaction terms for the Alkuri board of directors. Following the overview provided by Winston, representatives from Jefferies
reviewed for the Alkuri board of directors, management’s valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and the
financial projections for the combined business. Included in this presentation by Jefferies noted for the board of directors that the Transaction was priced
based upon forecasted 2022 revenue projections of $710 million for Babylon Holdings, with a 5.1x multiple ascribed to the 2022 revenue projections of
$710 million. Jefferies noted that this multiple represented a 35% discount to the median peer multiple. Certain projections for 2023 were also included in
the presentation for the sole purpose of understanding trends with respect to CAGR compared to the Selected Peer Companies and whether the 5.1x
multiple ascribed to the 2022 revenue projection was reasonable. Following Jefferies’ presentation, Winston and Sheppard summarized the legal and
regulatory due diligence conducted during the course of the process and the results of that review. Thereafter, Moss Adams, Barrington Advisors and
members of Alkuri management discussed the tax, business and accounting diligence conducted on Babylon Holdings. Both during and after these
summary reviews, the Alkuri board of directors engaged in extensive discussion, including with respect to the peer group selected by Alkuri management
and Jefferies, the diligence comfort obtained with respect to the forecasted 2022 revenue projections and other matters. In particular, the board of
directors of Alkuri asked questions on the diligence approach and ability of Alkuri management and its advisors to confirm Babylon Holdings’ pipeline of
prospects that provided support for the 2022 revenue projections. Alkuri management indicated that it had been provided access to Babylon Holdings’
salesforce data in order to better understand the nature and extent of contacts with the pipeline of prospects.
Following thorough discussion, the Alkuri board of directors determined to adjourn in order to afford directors more time to study the materials
presented to the board of directors and to review the proposed Merger Agreement and the other definitive agreements contemplated thereby.
Between May 31, 2021 and June 3, 2021, Alkuri management and advisors also obtained additional information and comfort in order to assist it in
the independent validation of the pipeline of prospects supporting the forecasted 2022 revenue projections. This included a review of evidentiary
support (such as emails or other communications) for the salesforce information previously reviewed by Alkuri, interviews with members of the Babylon
Holdings sales team (and its leadership) and other pipeline tracking information.
127
Table of Contents
Also, between May 31, 2021 and June 3, 2021, Babylon Holdings and their advisors finalized the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
contemplated thereby.
On June 3, 2021, via action taken by written consent, the Alkuri board of directors unanimously approved the entry into the Merger Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements contemplated thereby.
Later that day, Babylon Holdings and Alkuri issued a press release announcing the entry into the Merger Agreement.
Alkuri’s Reasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors
This explanation of Alkuri’s reasons for the Business Combination and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature
and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
On June 3, 2021, via action taken by written consent, the Alkuri board of directors, among other things, unanimously (i) approved the Merger
Agreement and related transaction agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) determined that the Business Combination is in the best
interests of Alkuri and its stockholders, and (iii) recommended that Alkuri’s stockholders approve and adopt the Business Combination.
Before reaching the above decision, the Alkuri board of directors reviewed the results of the due diligence conducted by Alkuri’s management,
which included:
•
review of Babylon Holdings’ material contracts, intellectual property, financial results and prospects, taxes, legal and regulatory issues,
leased properties, environmental challenges, insurance, engineering and technical achievements and challenges, and financial accounting,
including both audited and unaudited financial statements and internal controls;
•
meetings and calls with the management team and advisors of Babylon Holdings regarding operations, forecasts and the Business
Combination;
•
discussions with Babylon Holdings regarding its addressable market and competitive landscape;
•
financial projections prepared by Babylon Holdings’ management team; and
•
review of analyst reports and market trends in the telehealth care sector, publicly traded comparable companies (including traditional and
online healthcare and medical device providers and category-leading de-SPAC companies), and comparable transactions in the broader
healthcare sector.
As described under “—The Background of the Business Combination” above, Alkuri’s board of directors, in evaluating the Business Combination,
consulted with Alkuri’s management and advisors. In reaching its unanimous decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Alkuri’s board of directors considered a range of factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed
below. In light of the complexity of such factors, Alkuri’s board of directors, as a whole, did not consider it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it took into account in reaching its decision. Individual members of Alkuri’s board of directors
may have given different weight to different factors.
In considering the Business Combination, Alkuri’s board of directors gave considerable weight to the following factors:
•
Visionary Founder and World Class Management Team. Dr. Ali Parsadoust and the Babylon Holdings management team have a deep
understanding of both their direct customers (payer entities) and end users (network participants) and, with over a century of collective
experience in healthcare and
128
Table of Contents
technology, have the drive and competency to grow the business and provide healthcare in a manner that improves the end user’s
experience and reduces costs for its customers. Importantly, in a space like healthcare, with large and entrenched incumbents and relatively
high barriers to entry, Alkuri believes it is critical to combine the experience, competency and drive of a qualified and accomplished
management team like Babylon Holdings’ with a proven entrepreneurial leader like Dr. Ali Parsadoust, who brings a bold vision to drive
change in the segment using technology and a customer-focused approach. Dr. Ali Parsadoust built the first private company to run a U.K.
National Health Service (NHS) hospital, Circle Health, which then became Europe’s largest partnership of clinicians before going public in
2012. Dr. Ali Parsadoust has been named by The Times among the 100 global people to watch, and by the Health Service Journal among the
100 most influential people in U.K. healthcare.
•
Large market opportunity. The $10 trillion global healthcare market, is expected to grow over the coming decades and there is a clear need
for accessibility, quality and affordability. Alkuri also believes that the market is early in its adoption of technology, even in large economies
like the United States. To date, Babylon Holdings has deployed its technology in 16 countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Canada, the United States, Rwanda and the
United Kingdom) and actively provides clinical services in three (the United States, the United Kingdom and Rwanda). Babylon Holdings is
focused on developing its technology and growing its existing market in the United States, which represents an almost $4 trillion healthcare
market opportunity, while also planting roots in new geographical markets.
•
Disruptors. Babylon Holdings is paving the way in the digital transformation of healthcare. By reengineering the healthcare value change
and balancing accessibility, affordability and quality, Babylon Holdings is using its technology platform to connect users to clinical experts
and provide virtual care, in-person medical care and post-care offerings. In Alkuri’s view, Babylon Holding is unique in applying a mobile
native, digital-first approach at scale to proactive and preventative end-to-end healthcare, which disrupts the traditional in-person, reactive,
“sick care” model that is prevalent in health systems around the world. As evidenced by other market segments like retail and entertainment,
Alkuri believes that digital-first platforms and products that are well- aligned to the changing needs of its customers can demonstrate more
rapid growth, claim significant market share, and deliver the potential for outsized returns relative to their physical-first peers. As a digital-
first disruptor that breaks the mold of a system dominated by clinic- and physical-first competitors, Alkuri believes Babylon Holdings
represents a similar potential opportunity in the healthcare segment, as evidenced in particular by its accelerated growth in the United
States over the past year. For example, the median growth rate for 2019, 2020 and expected 2021 revenue for the Selected Peer Companies in
both integrated care and telemedicine was roughly 40% per year, based on publicly available information, including public filings, while the
Babylon Holdings revenue growth rate for the same period is over 300% per year.
•
Next generation technology. Babylon Holdings’ artificial intelligence (“AI”) architecture and fully integrated technology platform is
designed to help its members navigate their deeply-personal healthcare journeys. Babylon Holdings’ AI has been designed with a focus on
delivering insights and efficiencies to members and clinicians. The AI’s core features include: interpretability and explainability to provide a
layer of transparency over insights and, efficiencies, quantification on uncertainty providing for less uncertainty and more accurate
predictions, data efficiency and flexibility enabling Babylon to adapt to multiple sources of information and consider latest clinical
guidelines, public studies and multiple sources of medical knowledge. In addition, unlike many of its peers which either focus on bringing
patients into their clinics or provide a single solution like fee-based telemedicine consultations, the broader technology platform is designed
to help manage the end-to-end care for a member, and represents what Alkuri believes is the cutting edge of digital-first healthcare and a
multi-year advantage over “technology enabled” industry incumbents and others seeking to enter the market.
•
Scalable, durable business model Babylon Holdings’ digital-first model is highly scalable and enables it to deliver fully-integrated,
personalized healthcare across the entire care spectrum through mobile
129
Table of Contents
devices the vast majority of individuals in Babylon Holdings’ target markets already own or access. Alkuri expects healthcare spending to
continue rising globally as the population in key markets like the United States continue to age, and Alkuri believes durable secular
industry trends toward digital solutions as well as value-based care will continue to drive adoption of digital healthcare services like those
offered by Babylon Holdings. Babylon Holdings has shown an ability to find market fit and rapidly scale both its software licensing
services and value-based care services, yet the 24 million members served by Babylon Holdings represent a small fraction of the total
addressable market. Alkuri believes Babylon Holdings’ technology advantages can enable it to grow revenues on a rate basis faster than its
peers, as it has for multiple years, by expanding the covered population and scope of services in its existing markets and customers,
expanding to new markets with new and existing customers, pursuing strategic partnership and inorganic growth through acquisitions and
continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure to improve capabilities. Furthermore, while demand for and adoption of telemedicine
solutions has generally been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it has demonstrated its benefit and importance in reaching patients,
Babylon Holdings believes that in the post-COVID-19 world, its technology and business model will enable it to outperform its competitors,
in particular, those deploying a fee-for-services model who may have shown temporary increases in revenues.
•
Consumer and Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) go-to-market characteristics While in many cases the contracted customers of the
Babylon Holdings service will be a corporate entity like an insurance company, we believe that developing a strong consumer brand and
deep consumer relationships represents a significant opportunity for Babylon Holdings over time. Alkuri believes a unique characteristic of
the Babylon Holdings model is that, unlike most traditional “sick care” systems in healthcare, which generally reward expensive and
episodic emergency care, Babylon Holdings’ business and gross margin can actually improve as more members engage with the product,
provide data to enable preventative care, and avoid costly urgent care, emergency room and hospital visits. Alkuri expects that building
strong direct relationships and brand equity with Babylon Holdings’ consumer members can create both significant potential bottom-line
improvements and retentive capacity for its payer clients and contracts while enhancing Babylon Holdings’ overall market position and
ability to differentiate itself from its competitors. Alkuri’s management’s deep expertise in scaling consumer brands, business models and
products, particularly in mobile, by using digital marketing strategies and technology-enabled salesforces to help scale businesses may be
instrumental in helping Babylon Holdings reach new customers and end users, and to build a differentiated brand positioning and
awareness in a market that we believe is lacking in strong consumer-oriented brands.
•
Organic and inorganic growth potential Babylon Holdings has experienced robust growth in its early stages yet Alkuri sees significant
addressable market expansion opportunities, with potential expansion in the United States and other new geographies, as well as potential
opportunities for inorganic growth through acquisitions. Notably, the potential for market expansion and inorganic growth is not
contemplated in the current growth projections of Babylon Holdings.
•
Defensible market position. The healthcare industry and, to a lesser extent, the telemedicine and digital self-care industries in which we
operate are highly competitive, however most of Babylon Holdings’ competitors are generally focused on one specific slice of the
healthcare spectrum, single chronic condition or a single mode of service (e.g., telemedicine), or are limited to specific and smaller
geographic ranges due to their reliance on operating owned physical locations, rather than delivering the entire healthcare needs of a
member on a national or even global basis. Babylon Holdings has developed a digital platform and business model that Alkuri believes will
be difficult for other companies in the healthcare and traditional fee-for-service space to emulate.
•
Attractive Valuation. The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon
Holdings at $3.515 billion (or 5.1x projected 2022E revenues of $710 million) which represents a sizeable discount to public trading market
valuations of comparable companies across digital and telehealth industries and digitally enabled healthcare providers. The set of
comparable companies to Babylon Holdings was selected based on the existing universe of publicly traded companies at
130
Table of Contents
the time of the transaction. Additionally, the valuation discount is relative to companies that are growing at lower rates than Babylon
Holdings. Adjusting for Babylon Holdings’ accelerated growth resulted in the valuation range representing an even more sizeable discount
to its peers, which we believe positions the Business Combination as an attractive opportunity for Alkuri Stockholders.
Alkuri’s board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Business
Combination, including, but not limited to, the following:
•
Potential Inability to Complete the Business Combination. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility that the Business
Combination may not be completed and the potential adverse consequences to Alkuri if the Business Combination is not completed, in
particular the expenditure of time and resources in pursuit of the Business Combination and the loss of the opportunity to participate in the
transaction. They considered the uncertainty related to factors outside of the control of the parties to the transaction. The Business
Combination Agreement also includes an exclusivity provision that prohibits Alkuri from soliciting other initial business combination
proposals, which restricts Alkuri’s ability to consider other potential initial business combinations until the earlier of the termination of the
Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Business Combination.
•
The Risk that Alkuri’s Public Stockholders Would Vote Against the Business Combination Proposal or Exercise Their Redemption
Rights. The Alkuri board of directors considered the risk that some of the current public stockholders would vote against the Business
Combination proposal or decide to exercise their redemption rights, thereby depleting the amount of cash available in the trust account to
an amount below the minimum required to consummate the Business Combination. Further, the fact that public stockholders may vote for
the Business Combination proposal while also exercising their redemption rights mitigates against any incentive a public stockholder might
have to vote against the Business Combination proposal, especially to the extent that they hold public warrants which would be worthless
if the Business Combination is not completed.
•
Babylon Holdings’ Business Risks. The Babylon Holdings board of directors considered that Babylon Stockholders would be subject to
the execution risks associated with Babylon Holdings if they retained their public shares following the Closing, which were different from
the risks related to holding public shares of Alkuri prior to the Closing. In this regard, the Alkuri board of directors considered that there
were risks associated with successful implementation of Babylon Holdings’ long term business plan and strategy and Babylon Holdings
realizing the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination on the timeline expected or at all. The Alkuri board of directors considered
that the failure of any of these activities to be completed successfully may decrease the actual benefits of the Business Combination and
that Alkuri Stockholders may not fully realize these benefits to the extent that they expected to retain the public shares following the
completion of the Business Combination. For additional description of these risks, please see “Risk Factors.”
•
Post-Business Combination Corporate Governance. The Alkuri board of directors considered the corporate governance provisions of the
Merger Agreement and Babylon Holdings’ anticipated organizational documents and the effect of those provisions on the governance of
Babylon Holdings following the Closing. In particular, they considered that, assuming no redemptions by Alkuri Stockholders, the Founder
will individually control shares representing approximately 81.7% of Babylon Holdings’ voting power (taking account of the Stockholder
Earnout Shares) upon completion of the Business Combination and have the right to designate a majority of directors to the board of
directors of Babylon Holdings for as long as he hold certain amounts of shares of Babylon Shares and will have a right to approve or reject
transactions involving Babylon Holdings. The Alkuri board of directors also considered the circumstances under which the “high vote”
stock would convert into “low vote” stock. The Alkuri board of directors was aware that these rights are not generally available to
stockholders of Alkuri, including stockholders that may hold a large number of shares, or directors of Alkuri. See “Agreements Entered Into
in Connection with the Merger Agreement” for detailed discussions of the terms and conditions of these agreements.
131
Table of Contents
•
No Survival of Remedies for Breach of Representations, Warranties or Covenants by Babylon Holdings. The Alkuri board of directors
considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement provide that neither Alkuri nor its stockholders will have any recourse against Babylon
Holdings or its current shareholders after the Closing of the Business Combination to recover for losses as a result of any inaccuracies or
breaches of the Babylon Holdings representations, warranties or covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement.
•
Litigation. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility of litigation challenging the Business Combination or that an adverse
judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could enjoin consummation of the Business Combination.
•
Fees and Expenses. The Alkuri board of directors considered the fees and expenses associated with completing the Business Combination,
which it estimated as approximately $68.5 million.
•
Diversion of Management. The Alkuri board of directors considered the potential for diversion of management and employee attention
during the period prior to the completion of the Business Combination, and the potential negative effects on Babylon Holdings’ business.
•
Alkuri’s Management and Directors May Have Different Interests in the Business Combination Than the Public Stockholders. The
Alkuri board of directors also considered the fact that members of Alkuri’s management and board of directors may have interests that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of its stockholders generally, including the matters described under “The Merger
Agreement— Interests of Alkuri’s Officers and Directors in the Transactions” above. However, Alkuri’s board of directors concluded that
the potentially disparate interests would be mitigated because (i) these interests were disclosed in the Alkuri IPO prospectus, and (ii) these
disparate interests would exist or may be even greater with respect to a business combination with another target company.
•
Risks Related to the Dual-Class Share Structure. The Alkuri board of directors also considered the risk of concentrating voting control in
the dual-class share structure (with “super-voting” rights for the Founder), but determined that they were outweighed by the long-term
benefits that a founder-controlled company would provide to Alkuri Stockholders and future shareholders of Babylon after Closing.
Unaudited Projected Financial Information
Babylon Holdings does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future sales, earnings, or other results. However, the management of
Babylon Holdings has prepared the prospective financial information set forth below to present key elements to the forecasts provided to Alkuri. The
accompanying prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of
Babylon Holdings’ management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the
best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of Babylon Holdings. However,
this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/prospectus
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.
Neither Babylon Holdings’ independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or
performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form
of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial
information.
The projections are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain and, though considered
reasonable by Babylon Holdings’ management as of the date of its
132
Table of Contents
preparation, are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in the prospective financial information, including, among others, risks and uncertainties, as described in the “Risk
Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” The prospective financial information is subjective in many respects;
and since the prospective financial information covers multiple years, that information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Babylon Holdings or that actual results
will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information. Furthermore, the prospective financial information does not take
into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that information was prepared.
The financial projections were requested by, and disclosed to, Alkuri for use as a component in its overall evaluation of Babylon Holdings and are
included in this proxy statement/prospectus on that account. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this proxy statement/prospectus
should not be regarded as a representation by Babylon Holdings, Alkuri or any other person that the results contained in the prospective financial
information will be achieved, and should not be regarded as an indication that Alkuri, the Alkuri board of directors, or their respective affiliates, advisors
or other representatives considered, or now considers, such financial projections necessarily to be predictive of actual future results or to support or fail
to support your decision whether to vote for or against the Business Combination. You are cautioned not to rely on the projections in making a decision
regarding the transaction, as the projections may be materially different than actual results. We will not refer back to the financial projections in our future
periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act.
Babylon Holdings does not expect to generally publish its business plans and strategies or make external disclosures of its anticipated financial
position or results of operations. Accordingly, Babylon Holdings does not intend to update or otherwise revise the prospective financial information to
reflect circumstances existing since its preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying
assumptions are shown to be in error. Furthermore, Babylon Holdings does not intend to update or revise the prospective financial information to reflect
changes in general economic or industry conditions.
Additional information relating to the principal assumptions used in preparing the projections is set forth below. See “Risk Factors” for a
discussion of various factors that could materially affect Babylon Holdings financial condition, results of operations, business, prospects and securities.
The key elements of the projections provided by management of Babylon Holdings to Alkuri are summarized in the table below (dollars in millions):

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as profit (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization, net finance income (costs), income taxes, share-based
compensation, impairment expenses and foreign exchange gains or losses. For a description of how we calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
and the limitations of these non-IFRS financial measures, see “—Key Business and Financial Metrics— EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.”
Babylon Holdings’ revenue projections are based on management’s expectation of executed contracts delivering revenue in line with contractual
terms. Additionally, Babylon Holdings’ management expects to grow
133
Table of Contents
its number of members as part of its Babylon 360 solution, delivering recurring revenue through the signing of additional contracts with both existing and
new customers. Finally, Babylon Holdings’ management expects to sign new contracts, licensing out its technology platform. These revenue assumptions
were incorporated as part of Babylon Holdings’ projections, with each of value based care, clinical services and software licensing revenue assumed to
deliver different adjusted EBITDA margin contributions. In addition to the above assumptions, projected adjusted EBITDA reflects management’s
expectation of increasing headcount, marketing expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses with adjusted EBITDA margin improving over
the course of the projection.
Babylon Holdings’ management and board of directors determined the reasonableness of the projections based upon the terms of executed
contracts, the status of current commercial discussions relating to the expansion of existing and execution of new contracts and consistency with our
strategic focus on growing our value-based care services. The projections reflected a probability weighting of the future revenue opportunities pipeline,
projections of cost of care delivery that reflect our historical experience of providing clinical and value-based care services, estimates of platform &
application expenses and research & development expenses that reflect our historical expenditures and projected technology roadmap and our expected
increases in sales, general and administration expenses. The cost projections as a proportion of revenue were additionally benchmarked against our own
historical results and those disclosed by other businesses operating in similar markets. The projections were subject to review and approval by each
member of the senior leadership team with oversight of each business function and then subject to a final review by the Babylon Holdings board and
finance team, which resulted in an increase in the cost projections relating to some functions and the lowering of revenue projections provided by the
commercial team. The projections do not include the Higi acquisition as it was not contemplated at the time the projections were compiled.
Satisfaction of 80% Test
After consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section entitled “Proposal One—The Business Combination Proposal—Alkuri’s
Reasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors,” Alkuri’s board of directors concluded that the Business
Combination met all of the requirements disclosed in the prospectus for the Alkuri IPO with respect to Alkuri’s initial business combination, including
that the Business Combination had a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of execution of the
Merger Agreement.
Interests of Certain Persons in the Business Combination
See “Special Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders—Interests of Alkuri’s Officers and Directors in the Transactions” and “Special Meeting of Alkuri
Stockholders—Interests of Babylon Holdings’ Directors and Officers in the Business Combination”.
Involvement of Underwriter of Alkuri IPO in the Transactions
Jefferies served as the sole underwriter for the Alkuri IPO and will receive approximately $12.1 million of deferred underwriting commissions
therefrom in connection with the consummation of Alkuri’s initial business combination. Jefferies has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred
underwriting commissions held in the Trust Account in the event that Alkuri does not complete its initial business combination prior to the end of the
completion window (subject to any extension period thereof), and in such a circumstance, will not receive any of such funds.
As described further below, Jefferies is also providing certain services in connection with the Transactions and will receive compensation in
connection therewith. Jefferies’ receipt of the deferred underwriting commissions is not dependent on its provision of services in connection with the
Transactions.
134
Table of Contents
As discussed under “Proposal No. 1—The Business Combination Proposal—Background of the Business Combination,” Jefferies is serving as
Alkuri’s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies’ engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to provide
Alkuri with financial advice and assistance in connection with the Transactions, including providing financial advice on the potential business
combination with Babylon Holdings, assisting Alkuri in requesting and analyzing due diligence information received from Babylon Holdings, reviewing
financial information of Babylon Holdings, developing presentations for the Alkuri board of directors and providing other customary financial advisory
and investment banking services. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies will receive a financial advisory fee of $10 million (the “Jefferies
Financial Advisory Fee”). Alkuri also has agreed to provide Jefferies with customary expense reimbursement, including fees and expenses of its counsel,
and to indemnify it and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of Jefferies’ financial advisory engagement and the Transactions. No entity
(other than Jefferies) is serving as Alkuri’s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions.
Additionally, as discussed under “Proposal No. 1—The Business Combination Proposal—Background of the Business Combination,” Jefferies is
serving as lead placement agent in connection with the PIPE Investment together with Citi and Pareto Securities AB. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies’
placement agent engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to assist Alkuri in (i) identifying and contacting potential PIPE Investors, (ii) preparing an
investor presentation and/or marketing materials for distribution to potential PIPE Investors, (iii) soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Babylon Class
A shares pursuant to the PIPE Investment and (iv) negotiating the financial aspects of the PIPE Investment on Alkuri’s behalf. In respect of such
services, upon the consummation of the Transactions, the placement agents, including Jefferies, will collectively receive a placement fee equal to 3.0% of
the aggregate price at which such Babylon Class A shares are sold pursuant to the PIPE Investment, which is expected to be $6.9 million in the aggregate
and of which $738,000 will be payable to Jefferies (the “Jefferies Placement Fee”), and whether or not the Transactions are consummated, Jefferies will
receive expense reimbursement customary for a PIPE transaction of this nature (subject to the terms and conditions of its engagement letter with Alkuri).
Alkuri also has agreed to indemnify Jefferies and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of its placement agent engagement or information
contained in or omitted from the offering materials in connection with the PIPE Investment.
Because (i) Jefferies will only receive its deferred underwriting commissions upon the consummation of Alkuri’s initial business combination during
the completion window (subject to any extension period thereof), (ii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Financial Advisory Fee upon the
consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Placement Fee upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies
has an interest in the Transactions being consummated. Such interest may have presented, and may in the future present, a conflict of interest. Alkuri was
aware of and considered such potential conflicts in engaging Jefferies as its financial advisor and as lead placement agent. Alkuri’s stockholders should
consider the role of Jefferies in evaluating “Proposal No. 1—The Business Combination Proposal” and the other proposals.
On April 12, 2021, Alkuri retained Jefferies to act as lead left placement agent on the PIPE Investment. At the request of Babylon Holdings, Alkuri
also retained Citi as an additional non-lead placement agent on the PIPE Investment in order to, among other things, ensure that Babylon Holdings had
direct visibility into the PIPE Investment process. Babylon Holdings had previously retained Ardea and Citi as its financial advisors in connection with
the merger, who will receive $7,500,000 and $4,000,000 respectively, and any additional amount at Babylon Holdings’ discretion in fees for their respective
involvement in such transactions.
Anticipated Accounting Treatment
The Transactions are comprised of a series of transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as described elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus. For accounting purposes, the Transactions will be effectuated in three main steps:
1.
The exchange of shares held by Babylon Holdings’ shareholders, which is accounted for as a recapitalization in accordance with IFRS.
135
Table of Contents
2.
The merger of Alkuri with Merger Sub, which is not within the scope of IFRS 3 (“Business Combinations”) since Alkuri does not meet the
definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Any difference between the fair value of Babylon Class A Shares issued and the fair
value of Alkuri’s identifiable net assets should to be recorded as a transaction expense related to the recapitalization. For purposes of the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, it is assumed that the fair value of each individual Babylon Class A Share
issued to Alkuri Stockholders is equal to the fair value of each individual Babylon shareholder resulting from the $3.515 billion equity value
assigned to Babylon Holdings in the Merger Agreement.
3.
The Subscription Agreements related to the PIPE Investment, which were executed concurrently with and following the Merger Agreement,
will result in the issuance of Babylon Class A Shares, leading to an increase in share capital and share premium.
Regulatory Matters
The Business Combination is not subject to any federal or state regulatory requirement or approval, except for the filings with the State of Delaware
necessary to effectuate the Business Combination.
No Appraisal Rights
Under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of Alkuri Common Stock will not have appraisal rights in
connection with the Business Combination.
Resale of Babylon Shares
The Babylon Class A Shares to be issued to Alkuri Stockholders (other than certain Babylon Class A Shares to be issued to the Sponsor) in
connection with the Business Combination will be freely transferable under the Securities Act except for shares issued to any shareholder who may be
deemed for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act an “affiliate” of Alkuri immediately prior to the Effective Time or an “affiliate” of Babylon
following the Business Combination. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are
under common control with, Babylon or Alkuri (as appropriate) and may include the executive officers, directors and significant shareholders of Babylon
or Alkuri (as appropriate).
Stock Exchange Listing of Babylon Class A Shares
Babylon Holdings will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, prior to the Effective Time, the Babylon Class A Shares and warrants
(including Babylon Class A Shares and warrants issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement) to be approved for listing on the NYSE under the symbols
“BBLN” and “BBLN.W,” respectively, subject to official notice of issuance. Approval of the listing on the NYSE of the Babylon Class A Shares (subject
to official notice of issuance) is a condition to each party’s obligation to complete the Business Combination.
Delisting and Deregistration of Alkuri Securities
If the Business Combination is completed, shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock, Alkuri Warrants and Alkuri units will be delisted from Nasdaq
and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.
Implications of being an “Emerging Growth Company” and a “Foreign Private Issuer”
Each of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings is, and consequently, following the Business Combination, Babylon will be, an “emerging growth company,”
as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, Babylon will be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting
136
Table of Contents
requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to
comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in their periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find Babylon’s securities less
attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Babylon’s securities and the prices of Babylon’s securities may be more volatile.
Babylon will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the
closing of the Alkuri IPO, (b) in which Babylon has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which Babylon is deemed to be a large
accelerated filer, which means the market value of Babylon’s common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day
of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter; and (ii) the date on which Babylon has issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt
securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Babylon Holdings is also considered a “foreign private issuer” and will report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with “foreign private
issuer” status. This means that, even after Babylon Holdings no longer qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” as long as it qualifies as a “foreign
private issuer” under the Exchange Act, it will be exempt from certain provisions of and intends to take advantage certain exemptions from the Exchange
Act that are applicable to U.S. public companies, including:
•
the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under
the Exchange Act;
•
the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for
insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and
Babylon Holdings may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until such time as it is no longer a “foreign private issuer.” Babylon Holdings
could lose its status as a “foreign private issuer” under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of Babylon Holdings’ outstanding voting
securities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of the Babylon Holding’s
directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents; (ii) more than 50% of Babylon Holdings’ assets are located in the United States; or (iii)
Babylon Holdings’ business is administered principally in the United States.
Babylon Holdings’ may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. Babylon Holdings has taken advantage of reduced
reporting requirements in this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus may be different
from the information you receive from Babylon Holdings’ competitors that are public companies, or other public companies in which you have made an
investment. We expect to lose our foreign private issuer status for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of increased contacts with the United
States.
Vote Required for Approval
The approval of the Business Combination Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Alkuri Common Stock. The failure to attend (or provide a proxy) or abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “against” the Business Combination
Proposal. Brokers are not entitled to vote on the Business Combination Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder and, consequently,
broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “against” the Business Combination Proposal.
The approval of the Business Combination Proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Transactions. If the Business Combination Proposal
is not approved, the other proposals (except the Adjournment Proposal, as described below) will not be presented to Alkuri Stockholders for a vote.

Overview
We are seeking shareholder approval for the Babylon Holdings Limited 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan is being
adopted by Babylon Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and will become effective upon the Closing. The 2021 Plan is intended to
replace Babylon Holding’s Prior Plans (as defined below). Shareholder approval of the 2021 Plan is being sought in accordance with the Merger
Agreement. Approval of the 2021 Plan will allow Babylon to provide equity awards as part of Babylon’s compensation program, an important tool for
motivating, attracting and retaining talented employees and for creating shareholder value. Non-approval of the 2021 Plan may compel Babylon to
significantly increase the cash component of employee compensation following the Closing to attract and retain key employees because Babylon would
need to replace components of compensation Babylon Holdings historically delivered in the form of equity awards, which could therefore reduce
Babylon’s operating cash flow.
The Alkuri board of directors believes that long-term incentive compensation programs align the interests of management, employees and
shareholders to create long-term shareholder value. Equity plans such as the 2021 Plan increase Babylon’s ability to achieve this objective, and, by
allowing for several different forms of long-term incentive awards, helps Babylon recruit, reward, motive, and retain talented personnel. The Babylon
Holdings board of directors believes that the approval of the 2021 Plan is essential to Babylon’s continued success, and in particular, Babylon’s ability to
attract and retain outstanding and highly skilled individuals in the extremely competitive labor markets in which Babylon will compete. Equity awards are
also crucial to Babylon’s ability to motivate employees to achieve its goals.
Key Plan Provisions
•
The 2021 Plan will continue until the 10th anniversary of the Closing, unless earlier terminated by the Babylon board of directors of directors
or its delegee;
•
The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of share options (including “incentive stock options” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
and options that are not incentive stock options), share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, and other share based

Summary of the 2021 Plan
The following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal features of the 2021 Plan and its operation. However, this summary is not a complete
description of all of the provisions of the 2021 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the specific language of the 2021 Plan. A copy of the 2021 Plan is
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.
139Table of Contents
The purpose of the 2021 Plan is to enhance Babylon’s ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who make (or are expected to make) important
contributions to Babylon by providing these individuals with equity ownership opportunities. These incentives will be provided through the grant of
share options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, or other share based awards as the administrator may determine. The
2021 Plan and all awards thereunder will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.
Eligibility
The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of “incentive stock options,” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, to Babylon’s employees and any
parent and subsidiary corporations’ employees, and for the grant of other share options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share
units, and other share based awards to employees and consultants of Babylon and its subsidiaries and directors of Babylon, provided that consultants
and directors who are not employees are only eligible to be granted awards under the Non-Employee Sub-Plan (the holder of an award is referred to here
as a “participant”). The actual number of individuals who will receive awards under the 2021 Plan cannot be determined in advance because the
administrator has the discretion to select the participants on the basis of their service to Babylon and its subsidiaries. We expect Babylon and its
subsidiaries to have as of immediately following the Closing, approximately 3 non-employee directors, 1,200 full-time employees (including our employee
directors), 600 part-time employees and 0 consultants who would be eligible to participate in the 2021 Plan.
Authorized Shares
Subject to the adjustment provisions contained in the 2021 Plan and the evergreen provision described below, the maximum aggregate number of
Babylon Class A Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan is (i) 45,335,210 Babylon Class A Shares, plus (ii) any Babylon Class
A Shares subject to share options granted under the Prior Plans and which are subsisting on the Closing Date and expire, lapse or are terminated,
exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased or cancelled without having been fully exercised, or withheld to satisfy a tax withholding obligation
terminate as a result of being unexercised or forfeited to or repurchased by Babylon, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2021 Plan
pursuant to clause (ii) equal to 23,902,282 Babylon Class A Shares. The 2021 Plan also includes an evergreen provision that provides for an automatic
annual increase to the number of Babylon Class A Shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the
2022 fiscal year, equal to the least of:
•
45,335,210 Babylon Class A Shares;
•
5% of the total number of all classes of Babylon shares outstanding as of the last day of its immediately preceding fiscal year; or
•
Such lesser amount determined by the administrator.
The 2021 Plan provides that the evergreen provision will terminate following the increase on the first day of the 2031 fiscal year.
If all or any part of an award or awards granted under the 2021 Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) expires, lapses or is terminated,
exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased or cancelled without having been fully exercised, or is withheld to satisfy a tax withholding obligation in
connection with an award or to satisfy a purchase or exercise price of an award, the unused Babylon Class A Shares covered by the award or awards
granted under the 2021 Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) will, as applicable, become or again be available for awards granted under the 2021
Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan).

profits, distribution, share split, reverse share split, spin-off, rights offering, re-designation, redenomination, consolidation recapitalization through a
large, nonrecurring cash dividend, or any similar equity restructuring transaction, that affects the number or class of shares (or other Babylon securities)
or the nominal value of Babylon Class A Shares (or other Babylon securities) and causes a change in the per share value of the Babylon Class A Shares
underlying outstanding awards (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the conversion of any convertible securities of Babylon), the administrator will
equitably adjust (i) class(es) and maximum number of shares subject to the 2021 Plan, (ii) the class(es) and maximum number of shares that may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of “incentive stock options” and (iii) each outstanding award as it deems appropriate to reflect such transaction, which may
include adjusting the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding award and/or the award’s exercise price or grant price (if applicable),
granting new awards to award holders, and making a cash payment to award holders.
The price of Babylon Holdings ordinary shares as determined in connection with the Business Combination is $3.02 per share.
Plan Administration
To the extent that the applicable laws permit, the Babylon board of directors may delegate any or all of its powers under the 2021 Plan to one or
more committees or officers of Babylon or any of its subsidiaries. The Babylon board of directors may abolish any committee or re-vest in itself any
previously delegated authority at any time.
The administrator has authority to (i) determine which service providers receive awards, (ii) grant awards, and (iii) set award terms and conditions,
in each case subject to the conditions and limitations in the 2021 Plan and all applicable laws. The administrator also has the authority to take all actions
and make all determinations under the 2021 Plan, to approve the forms of award agreements for use under the 2021 Plan, to interpret the 2021 Plan and the
terms of awards and to adopt, amend and repeal administrative rules, guidelines and practices as it deems advisable. The administrator may correct
defects and ambiguities, supply omissions and reconcile inconsistencies in the 2021 Plan or any award as it deems necessary or appropriate to administer
the 2021 Plan and any awards. The administrator’s determinations under the 2021 Plan are in its sole discretion and will be final and binding on all persons
having or claiming any interest in the 2021 Plan or any award.
Share Options and Share Appreciation Rights
Options and share appreciation rights may be granted under the 2021 Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan, the administrator will
determine the terms and conditions of options, including when such options vest and become exercisable (and the administrator will have the discretion
to accelerate the time at which such options will vest or become exercisable). The administrator will establish each option’s and share appreciation right’s
exercise price and specify the exercise price in the award agreement. The exercise price will be no less than the nominal value of a Babylon Class A Share,
provided that, in respect of participants who are subject to tax in the United States, the exercise price generally may not be less than less than 100% of the
fair market value of a Babylon Class A Share on the grant date of the option or share appreciation right, and, provided further that, in respect of
participants who own 10% of the voting power of all classes of equity securities of Babylon or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations, the exercise
price of an “incentive stock option” generally may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of a Babylon Class A Share on the grant date of the
option or share appreciation rights. The term of an option or share appreciation right generally cannot exceed 10 years, provided that, in respect of
participants who own 10% of the voting power of all classes of equity securities of Babylon or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations, the term of an
“incentive stock option” generally may not be more than five years. After a participant’s service terminates, he or she generally may exercise the vested
portion of his or her option for the period of time stated in his or her option agreement.
Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units
Restricted shares and restricted share units may be granted under the 2021 Plan. Restricted share awards are grants of shares that vest in
accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. Restricted
141
Table of Contents
share units are bookkeeping entries representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share. The administrator will determine the number of
shares of restricted shares or restricted share units granted to any service provider and may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be
appropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance goals or continued service to Babylon
or its subsidiaries), and the administrator will have the discretion to accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Dividends or
dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any restricted shares or restricted share units, as determined (and on such
terms as may be determined) by the administrator and specified in the award agreement, subject to applicable law. Unless otherwise determined by the
administrator, a participant holding restricted shares will have voting and other rights as a shareholder of Babylon with respect to such restricted shares,
except that any redesignation and subsequent redemption and forfeiture provisions of Babylon will apply. A participant holding restricted share units will
have no rights of a shareholder with respect to such restricted share units unless and until the shares are delivered in settlement of the restricted share
units.
Other Share Based Awards
Other share based awards may be granted to service providers, including awards entitling service providers to receive Babylon Class A Shares to
be delivered in the future (whether based on specified performance criteria, performance goals or otherwise), in each case subject to any conditions and
limitations in the 2021 Plan. Such other share based awards will also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other awards, as standalone
payments and as payment in lieu of compensation to which a service provider is otherwise entitled. Other share based awards may be paid in Babylon
Class A Shares or other property, as the administrator determines. Subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan, the administrator will determine the terms
and conditions of each other share based award, including any purchase price, performance condition, performance goal, transfer restrictions, and
vesting conditions, which will be set forth in the applicable award agreement.
Non-Transferability of Awards
Except as the administrator may determine or provide in an award agreement or otherwise for awards, awards may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during
the life of the participant, will be exercisable only by the participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit
transfer of an award pursuant to a domestic relations order or in such other manner that is not prohibited by applicable tax and securities laws upon the
participant’s request and provided that the participant and the transferee enter into a share transfer and other agreements as required by Babylon. If an
option is an “incentive stock option,” such option may be deemed to no longer qualify as an “incentive stock option” as a result of a transfer.
Corporate Events
In the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, amalgamation, repurchase, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or sale,
transfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale or exchange of Shares or other securities of Babylon
or a “change in control” (referred to here as a “corporate event”), the administrator, on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, is hereby
authorized to take any one or more of the actions set forth in the 2021 Plan whenever the administrator determines that such action is appropriate,
including that an award be continued or substituted by the successor corporation, that vesting and exercisability of an award may accelerate
automatically upon consummation of the transaction, or that the unvested portions of an award may be terminated without consideration. The
administrator need not take the same action or actions with respect to all awards or portions thereof or with respect to all participants. The administrator
may take different actions with respect to the vested and unvested portions of an award.
142
Table of Contents
Clawback
All awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit the participant actually or constructively receives upon receipt or exercise of
any award or the receipt or resale of any Babylon Class A Shares underlying the award) will be subject to Babylon claw-back policy that may be adopted
from time to time to the extent such policy applies to the relevant participant, including any claw-back policy adopted to comply with applicable laws
(including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder) as set forth in such
claw-back policy or the award agreement, to the extent applicable and permissible under applicable laws. No recovery of compensation under such a claw-
back policy will be an event giving rise to a participant’s right to voluntary terminate employment upon a “resignation for good reason,” or for a
“constructive termination” or any similar term under any plan of or agreement with the Company.
Amendment or Termination
The Plan will come into existence on the day it is adopted by the Alkuri board of directors but no awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan prior
to the Closing. Unless earlier terminated by the Babylon board of directors, the 2021 Plan will remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the Closing,
but Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date in accordance with the 2021 Plan. No “incentive stock options” may be granted after the
tenth anniversary of the earlier of (i) the date the 2021 Plan is adopted by the Board, or (ii) the date the 2021 Plan is approved by Alkuri Stockholders. The
administrator may amend, suspend or terminate the 2021 Plan at any time; provided that no amendment, suspension or termination may materially impair
any award outstanding at the time of such amendment without the affected participant’s written consent. No awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan
during any suspension period or after 2021 Plan termination. Awards outstanding at the time of any 2021 Plan suspension or termination will continue to
be governed by the 2021 Plan and the award agreement, as in effect before such suspension or termination. The Babylon board of directors will obtain
shareholder approval of any amendment to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws.
Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following summary is intended only as a general guide to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of participation in the 2021 Plan. The
summary is based on existing U.S. laws and regulations as of July 2021, and there can be no assurance that those laws and regulations will not change in
the future. The summary does not purport to be complete and does not discuss the tax consequences upon a participant’s death, or the provisions of the
income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which the participant may reside. As a result, tax consequences for any particular
participant may vary based on individual circumstances. Interested parties should consult their own tax advisors as to specific tax consequences,
including the application and effect of foreign, state and local laws.
Incentive Stock Options
A participant recognizes no taxable income for regular income tax purposes as a result of the grant or exercise of an option that qualifies as
“incentive stock option” under Section 422 of the Code. If a participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares
acquired through the exercise the option after both the two-year anniversary of the date the option was granted and the one-year anniversary of the
exercise, the participant will recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the sale price of the shares and the exercise price, and we will
not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes.
However, if the participant disposes of such shares either on or before the two-year anniversary of the date of grant or on or before the one-year
anniversary of the date of exercise (a “disqualifying disposition”), any gain up to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise
over the exercise price generally will be taxed as ordinary income, unless the shares are disposed of in a transaction in which the participant would
143
Table of Contents
not recognize a gain (such as a gift). Any gain in excess of that amount will be a capital gain. If a loss is recognized, there will be no ordinary income, and
such loss will be a capital loss. Any ordinary income recognized by the participant upon the disqualifying disposition of the shares generally should be
deductible by us for federal income tax purposes, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.
For purposes of the alternative minimum tax, the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the exercise
date is treated as an adjustment item in computing the participant’s alternative minimum taxable income in the year of exercise. In addition, special
alternative minimum tax rules may apply to certain subsequent disqualifying dispositions of the shares or provide certain basis adjustments or tax credits.
Nonstatutory Stock Options
A participant generally recognizes no taxable income as the result of the grant of such an option. However, upon exercising the option, the
participant normally recognizes ordinary income equal to the amount that the fair market value of the shares on such date exceeds the exercise price. If the
participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of the shares
acquired by the exercise of such an option, any gain or loss (based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the exercise date)
will be taxed as capital gain or loss. No tax deduction is available to us with respect to the grant of such an option or the sale of the shares acquired
through the exercise of such an option, provided that we generally will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
ordinary income realized by the optionee in the year of exercise.
Share Appreciation Rights
In general, no taxable income is reportable when a share appreciation right is granted to a participant. Upon exercise, the participant generally will
recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of any shares received. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income
generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares
would be capital gain or loss.
Restricted Share Awards
A participant acquiring restricted shares generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date
(i.e., the date restrictions on the shares lapse). If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and
employment taxes. The participant may elect, pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code to accelerate the ordinary income tax event to the date of acquisition
by filing an election with the IRS no later than thirty days after the date the shares are acquired. Upon the sale of shares acquired pursuant to a restricted
share award, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the date the ordinary income tax event occurs,
will be taxed as capital gain or loss.
Restricted Share Unit Awards
There are no immediate tax consequences of receiving an award of restricted share units. A participant who is awarded restricted share units
generally will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of shares issued to such participant at the end of the
applicable vesting period or, if later, the settlement date elected by the administrator or a participant. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary
income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of any
shares received would be capital gain or loss.
144
Table of Contents
Section 409A
Section 409A of the Code provides certain requirements for non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements with respect to an individual’s
deferral and distribution elections and permissible distribution events. Awards granted under the 2021 Plan with a deferral feature will be subject to the
requirements of Section 409A. If an award is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the recipient of that award may recognize
ordinary income on the amounts deferred under the award, to the extent vested, which may be prior to when the compensation is actually or
constructively received. Also, if an award that is subject to Section 409A fails to comply with Section 409A’s provisions, Section 409A imposes an
additional 20% federal income tax on compensation recognized as ordinary income on the participant, as well as interest on such deferred compensation.
The administrator may, without participant consent, amend the 2021 Plan or awards, adopt policies and procedures or take any other actions intended to
preserve the tax treatment of awards under the 2021 Plan, including any such actions intended to exempt the 2021 Plan or awards thereunder from Section
409A or comply with Section 409A.
Tax Effect for Babylon
Babylon generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the 2021 Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income
realized by a participant and at the time the participant recognizes such income (for example, the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option) except to the
extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code. Special rules limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our chief executive
officer and certain “covered employees” as determined under Section 162(m) and applicable guidance. Under Section 162(m), the annual compensation
paid to any of these specified individuals will be deductible only to the extent that it does not exceed $1,000,000.
THE FOREGOING IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF THE EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION UPON PARTICIPANTS AND BABYLON
WITH RESPECT TO AWARDS UNDER THE 2021 PLAN. IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE AND DOES NOT DISCUSS THE IMPACT
OF EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER TAX REQUIREMENTS, THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF A PARTICIPANT’S DEATH, OR THE PROVISIONS OF
THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, STATE, OR FOREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANT MAY RESIDE.
New Plan Benefits
The benefits or amounts that an employee, director, or consultant may receive under the 2021 Plan is in the discretion of the administrator and
therefore cannot be determined in advance. Alkuri has not previously sponsored an equity incentive plan, and, therefore, the aggregate number of
Babylon Class A Shares, which would have been received by or allocated to our named executive officers; executive officers, as a group; directors who
are not executive officers, as a group; and all other current employees who are not executive officers, as a group is not currently determinable. The value
of future awards granted under the 2021 Plan will depend on a number of factors, including the fair market value of the ordinary shares on future dates,
the exercise decisions made by the participants and the extent to which any applicable performance goals necessary for vesting or payment are achieved.
Babylon will grant share options to three Babylon employees under the 2021 Plan, effective as of the Closing and subject to the employee continuing to
provider service through the Closing, as agreed by Parties.
Employee Compensation Plan Information
Alkuri did not maintain, or have any securities authorized for issuance under, any equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2020.

Table of Contents
Vote Required for Approval
Approval of the 2021 Plan requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Failure to vote by proxy or to vote in person at the special meeting, or a broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of the vote
on this proposal.
Resolution
The full text of the resolution to be passed is as follows:
“RESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution, that the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and any form award agreements thereunder, be
approved, ratified and confirmed in all respects.”
Recommendation of the Alkuri board of directors:
THE ALKURI BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE
APPROVAL OF THE EQUITY PLAN PROPOSAL.
The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of Alkuri’s directors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of such
director(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of Alkuri and its shareholders and what he, she or they may believe is best
for himself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that shareholders vote for the proposals. In addition, Alkuri’s officers have interests in the
Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a shareholder. See the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions” for a further discussion of these considerations.

The Adjournment Proposal, if adopted, will allow Alkuri’s board of directors to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary. In
no event will Alkuri solicit proxies to adjourn the special meeting or consummate the Transactions beyond the date by which it may properly do so under
the SPAC Charter and Delaware law. The purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to provide more time to meet the requirements that are necessary to
consummate the Transactions. See the section titled “Proposal One – The Business Combination Proposal —Interests of Certain Persons in the
Business Combination.”
Consequences If the Adjournment Proposal Is Not Approved
If the Adjournment Proposal is presented to the meeting and is not approved by the stockholders, Alkuri’s board of directors may not be able to
adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to provide additional time to allow the parties to consummate the Transactions. In such
event, the Transactions may not be completed.
Required Vote
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Alkuri Common Stock
present and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, abstentions of votes in attendance at the meeting will have the same effect as a vote
“against” the Adjournment Proposal. Brokers are entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder
because the proposal is considered “routine.” Consequently, there should be no broker non-votes with respect to the Adjournment Proposal.

For a discussion of the Business Combination structure and merger consideration provisions of the Merger Agreement, see the section entitled
“Proposal One – The Merger Agreement Proposal.” Such discussion and the following summary of other material provisions of the Merger Agreement
is qualified by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. All
Alkuri Stockholders are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the
Business Combination.
The Merger Agreement summary below is included in this proxy statement/prospectus only to provide you with information regarding the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement and not to provide any other factual information regarding Alkuri, Babylon or their respective businesses.
Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read
only in conjunction with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Terms of the Merger; Reclassification; Merger Consideration
Prior to the Closing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of Babylon Holdings will be reclassified into Babylon
Class A Shares, other than the Babylon Holdings Class A Shares, which will be reclassified as Babylon Class B Shares. As a result of the Reclassification,
each outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00 (based on the
$3.515 billion equity value of Babylon Holdings). At the Closing, the Babylon Class B Shares will be held by the Founder. The Babylon Class B Shares
will have the same economic terms as the Babylon Class A Shares, but the Babylon Class B Shares will have 15 votes per share (while each Babylon Class
A Share will have one vote per share).
At the Closing, Merger Sub will merge with and into Alkuri, with Alkuri continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Babylon. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock (excluding shares held in treasury by Alkuri) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive one (1) Babylon Class A Share.
It is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri’s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the Babylon
Shares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon; (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power
of Babylon; (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Earnout Shares) and
0.6% of the voting power of Babylon; and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the Babylon Shares and
95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon being held by the
Founder. These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately
following the Business Combination; (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata
portion of the funds in Alkuri’s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing also excludes shares being
purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE
Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon assuming no
redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon assuming maximum redemptions.
Closing and Effective Time of the Transactions
The Closing of the Transactions will take place as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the third business day following
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Closing Date”) and summarized below under the subsection entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the Transactions,” unless Alkuri and Babylon agree in writing to another time or unless the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms. The Transactions are expected to be consummated promptly after the special meeting of Alkuri
Stockholders described in this proxy statement/prospectus.
148Table of Contents
Earnout
The Merger Agreement contemplates that Alkuri will issue at the Closing (i) Stockholder Earnout Shares and (ii) Sponsor Earnout Shares. The
Earnout Shares will, in four equal portions, be subject to pricing milestones at $12.50, $15.00, $17.50 and $20.00 (each, an “Earnout Price”). The release of
applicable restrictions placed on the Stockholder Earnout Shares will occur, subject to certain procedural requirements, if (i) after nine months following
the Closing Date, the Babylon Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds the applicable Earnout Price per share for twenty (20) of any thirty (30)
consecutive trading days on the NYSE or (ii) Babylon consummates a transaction which results in all the stockholders of Babylon having the right to
exchange all of their shares for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding the applicable Earnout Price. The release of the
Sponsor Earnout Shares will occur, subject to certain procedural requirements, if (i) after the Closing Date, the Babylon Class A Common Stock equals or
exceeds the applicable Earnout Price per share on the NYSE or (ii) Babylon consummates a transaction which results in all the stockholders of Babylon
having the right to exchange all of their shares for cash, securities or other property. In the event such milestones are not met, all of the Earnout Shares
for which the applicable milestone has not been met will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Babylon which Babylon can redeem for
$1.00.
Representations and Warranties
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of Alkuri relating, among other things, to:
•
corporate matters, including organization and power to conduct its business, qualifications, solvency, corporate authorizations,
enforceability and organizational documents;
•
absence of violations;
•
capitalization

The following discussion summarizes material provisions of certain Ancillary Agreements entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement.
Complete copies of the form of the Ancillary Agreements described below are set forth in the exhibits to the registration statement to which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, and are incorporated by reference.
Subscription Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings entered into certain Subscription Agreements with the
PIPE Investors, whereby each PIPE Investor subscribed for, and Babylon Holdings agreed to sell and issue to such PIPE Investor, a number of Babylon
Class A Shares at and in connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, in an amount not exceed 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares in the
aggregate.
Entities affiliated with the Sponsor have agreed to purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on
substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. Entities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust have agreed to purchase 200,000
Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth,
member of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’ share capital, and (ii)
Georgi Ganev, member of Babylon’s board of directors, and Invik S.A., a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’ share capital, have each agreed
to purchase 500,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE
Investors.
As of the date hereof, issuance or sale of the Babylon Class A Shares in connection with the Subscription Agreement has not been registered
under the Securities Act. Babylon has agreed, within 15 calendar days of Closing to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of
such Babylon Class A Shares and will use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing
thereof, but in any event no later than the earlier of (1) sixty (60) calendar days (or ninety (90) calendar days if the SEC notifies Babylon that it will
“review” the registration statement) following the Closing and (ii) the tenth (10th) business day after the date of Babylon is notified (in writing) by the
SEC that the registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will be subject to further review.
Voting and Support Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Babylon Holdings and Alkuri entered into the Voting and Support Agreement with
certain Babylon Holdings’ shareholders, whereby each such Babylon Holdings’ shareholder agreed to (i) not revoke their written consents approving the
Business Combination as shareholders of Babylon Holdings’, and (ii) vote (or cause to be voted) all of such Babylon Holdings’ shareholder’s Covered
Shares (as defined in the Voting and Support Agreement): (A) in favor of any other matters necessary for consummation of the Transactions, (B) against
authorizing the company to take action set forth in Section 5.01(a) of the Merger Agreement, and (C) against any Alternative Transaction or Proposed
Alternative Transaction (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement), or any other action that would reasonably be expected to materially impede
the Transactions. These obligations of such Babylon Holdings’ shareholders apply regardless of any recommendation by Babylon’s board of directors.
The Voting and Support Agreement also contains other negative covenants, pursuant to which each Babylon Holdings’ shareholders party to the
agreement promises not to (i) enter into any agreement of voting trust or grant a proxy or power of attorney with respect to any of such Babylon
Holdings’ shareholder’s Covered Shares that is inconsistent with such shareholder’s obligations under the Voting and Support Agreement, (ii) enter into
any agreement or undertaking that is otherwise inconsistent with, interfere with, or prohibit the Babylon Holdings’ shareholder from satisfying its
obligation under the Voting and Support Agreement, or (iii) solicit, negotiate, approve, resolve or endorse or take certain other actions with respect to any
Alternative Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
160Table of Contents
The Voting and Support Agreement will terminate with respect to each Babylon Holdings’ shareholder upon the earliest of (i) the Effective Time of
the Business Combination, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement, (iii) upon the mutual written agreement of Alkuri and such shareholder, and (iv)
the election of such shareholder in his, her or its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement following any amendment, supplement, waiver or other
modification of any term or provision of the Merger Agreement that has a material adverse impact on such shareholder.
Registration Rights Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Sponsor entered into a certain Registration Rights Agreement by and among Babylon
Holdings, Sponsor and certain Babylon Holdings’ shareholders, pursuant to which Babylon agreed (i) to file, within 30 days of the Closing Date, and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective as soon as practicable thereafter, a registration statement for a shelf registration on
Form F-1 or Form S-1, as applicable or, if Babylon is eligible to use a registration statement on Form F-3 or Form S-3, as applicable in each case, covering
the resale of all the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) on a delayed or continuous basis, (ii) to maintain a shelf
registration statement in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, (iii) to prepare and file with the SEC such amendments,
including post-effective amendments, and supplements as may be necessary to keep a Shelf continuously effective, available for use and in compliance
with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities, and in the event Babylon files a Form F-1 shelf,
(iv) to use commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Form F-1 shelf to a Form F-3 shelf as soon as practicable after Babylon Holdings is eligible to
use Form F-3.
Further, if any shelf ceases to be effective under the Securities Act, Babylon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such shelf to again
become effective. If a subsequent shelf registration is filed, Babylon Holdings agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause such
subsequent shelf registration to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly after the filing thereof; and (ii) keep such subsequent shelf
registration continuously effective, available for use in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any
Registrable Securities.
If any of Sponsor or any other Babylon shareholder following the Effective Time holds Registrable Securities that are not registered for resale on a
delayed or continuous basis, Babylon, upon written request of Alkuri, agreed to promptly use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the resale of
such Registrable Securities to be covered. The Sponsor or any Major Legacy Equity Holder may request to sell all or any portion of its Registrable
Securities in an underwritten offering or other coordinated offering that is registered pursuant to the shelf; provided, that Babylon will only be required to
effect an underwritten offering if such offering includes Registrable Securities expected to exceed $30 million (the lesser of (i) $10 million and (ii) all
remaining Registrable Securities owned by such holder in the case of a Block Trade); and each Demanding Holder may request three underwritten shelf
take downs per calendar year. All requests for underwritten shelf takedowns shall be made by giving written notice to Babylon Holdings specifying the
approximate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the underwritten shelf takedown.
If Babylon Holdings or any holder proposes to conduct a registered offering of, or if Babylon Holdings proposes to file a registration statement
under the Securities Act with respect to the Registration of, equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercised or exchangeable for, or
convertible unto equity securities, for its own account or for the account of Babylon shareholders (other than a registration statement (i) filed in
connection with an employee stock option or benefit plan, (ii) pursuant to registration statement filed on Form F-4 or Form S-4, as applicable, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into Babylon’s equity securities, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, or (v) for a rights offering), then Babylon will
provide written notice of such proposed offering to all Sponsor and all other Babylon shareholders then holding Registrable Securities describing the
amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing
underwriter(s), in such offering, and offering such Registerable Securities to such Babylon shareholders at least 10 days before the anticipated filing date
of such registration statement or, in the case of an underwritten offering pursuant to a shelf registration, the applicable “red herring” prospectus or
prospectus supplement used for marketing such offering.
161
Table of Contents
Babylon also agreed (i) to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended plan of distribution thereof and (ii) to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Babylon shareholder party to the
Registration Rights Agreement, its officers, directors and agents and each person who controls such Babylon shareholder, as applicable, against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any
registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement.
On June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into the Letter Agreement in connection with the Higi acquisition. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement,
Babylon and 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three largest shareholders in Higi, agreed that, among other things, Babylon would provide registration rights
to such shareholders at least as favorable as those being offered to PIPE Investors.
Lockup Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Babylon Holdings, the Sponsor and certain shareholders of Babylon have entered into a
lockup agreement (collectively, the “Lockup Agreement”). Pursuant to the Lockup Agreement, the Sponsor and such shareholders have agreed they will
not (A) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate or pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or enter into an agreement
to dispose of or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidation with respect to or decrease of a call equivalent position within the meaning
of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to any security, (B) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise,
or (C) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (A) or (B) with respect to their Babylon Shares, subject to certain
exceptions, (i) until the earlier of (A) a period of six months following the Closing (or, in the case of Dr. Ali Parsadoust or his affiliates, for a period of nine
months following the Closing) and (B) subsequent to the Closing, the date on which (x) the closing price of the Babylon Class A Shares equals or
exceeds $15.00 per share (as adjusted for share capital subdivisions, consolidations, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20
trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 90 days after the Closing or (y) Babylon completes a liquidation, merger, share capital
exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of Babylon’s members have the right to exchange their Babylon Shares for cash,
securities or other property(the “Transfer Restrictions”). The Sponsor has agreed that it shall not transfer its warrants to acquire Babylon Shares and the
Babylon Shares issuable upon the settlement or exercise of such warrants for 30 days after the Closing. The Transfer Restrictions do not apply to any
shares acquired pursuant to the Subscription Agreement or 3,665,625 Babylon Class A Shares to be received by the Sponsor in connection with the
Closing of the Business Combination as consideration for the exchange of its shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock of Babylon Holdings into Babylon
Class A Shares.
Director Nomination Agreement
Works Capital LLC (“Works Capital”), an entity affiliated with Alkuri’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, entered into that certain
Director Nomination Agreement with Babylon Holdings, pursuant to which Works Capital received the right to appoint a nominee to Babylon’s board of
directors following the consummation of the Business Combination until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, and Babylon Holdings agreed to take
all action necessary to ensure that such nominee is (i) included in Babylon’s slate of director nominees and recommended by Babylon Holdings’ board of
directors, and (ii) included in Babylon Holdings’ proxy statement when such nominee is up for election.
162
Table of Contents
Sponsor Agreement Amendment
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Sponsor entered into a certain letter agreement by and between Alkuri, Sponsor and
certain Sponsor insiders, pursuant to which Sponsor agreed (i) to vote all shares of Alkuri Common Stock owned by Sponsor in favor of the Business
Combination, against any SPAC Acquisition Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement), any other action that would be reasonably expected to
impede any of the Transactions, or any change in Alkuri’s board or management, (ii) to not redeem any Alkuri shares owned by such person in
connection with shareholder approvals related to any such shareholder approval, (iii) that the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be subject to the conditions
set forth in Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) to waive certain anti-dilution provisions set forth in Alkuri’s Certificate of Incorporation

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,"MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax considerations for U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined
below, and together, “Holders”) of Alkuri Common Stock and warrants exercisable for shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock (“Alkuri Warrants” and,
together with Alkuri Common Stock, each, an “Alkuri Security”) (other than the Sponsor or any of its affiliates) of (i) electing to have their Alkuri
Common Stock redeemed for cash if the Business Combination is completed, (ii) the Business Combination, and/or (iii) the ownership and disposition of
Babylon Class A Shares and warrants exercisable for Babylon Class A Shares (the ”Babylon Warrants”) after the Business Combination. This section
applies only to Holders that hold their Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares, and Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, as “capital assets” for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment). For purposes of this discussion, because the components of an Alkuri unit are
generally separable at the option of the Holder, the Holder of an Alkuri unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the
owner of the underlying Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrant components of the Alkuri unit. Accordingly, the separation of an Alkuri unit into the
one share of Alkuri Common Stock and the one-fourth of one Alkuri Warrant underlying the Alkuri unit generally should not be a taxable event for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. This position is not free from doubt, and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not
sustain, a contrary position. Holders of Alkuri Securities are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and any non-U.S.
tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination (including any redemption of Alkuri Common Stock) with respect to
any Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants held through Alkuri units (including alternative characterizations of Alkuri units). This discussion
generally assumes that the characterization of Alkuri units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion is included for general informational purposes only, does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
might be relevant to a Holder, and does not constitute, and is not, a tax opinion for or tax advice to any particular Holder. This discussion is limited to U.S.
federal income tax considerations and does not address estate or any gift tax considerations or considerations arising under the tax laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address any tax consequences to investors that directly or indirectly hold equity
interests in Babylon prior to the Business Combination. With respect to consequences of holding Babylon Class A Shares, this discussion is limited to
holders who acquire such Babylon Class A Shares in connection with the Business Combination or as a result of the exercise of a Babylon Warrant, and
with respect to Babylon Warrants, this discussion is limited to holders who hold such Babylon Warrants as a result of their ownership of Alkuri Warrants
prior to and through the Business Combination. This discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
to you in light of your particular circumstances, including the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on certain investment income and the different
consequences that may apply if you are subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax law that apply to certain types of investors, such as:
•
financial institutions or financial services entities;
•
broker-dealers;
•
taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules with respect to the Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares and/or
Babylon Warrants, as the case may be;
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares and/or
Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement;
•
tax-exempt entities;
•
governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;
•
insurance companies;
•
mutual funds;
164Table of Contents
•
pension plans;
•
regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;
•
partnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes);
•
U.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;
•
persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more (by vote or value) of Alkuri Common Stock, or, following the Business
Combination, Babylon Class A Shares (except as specifically provided below);
•
the Sponsor or its affiliates, officers or directors;
•
S corporations;
•
trusts and estates;
•
persons that acquired their Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, pursuant to an exercise of
employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation;
•
persons who purchase Babylon Class A Shares as part of the PIPE Investment;
•
persons that hold their Alkuri Securities or who will hold Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants as part of a straddle, constructive
sale, constructive ownership transaction, hedging, wash sale, synthetic security, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction;
•
U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; or
•
“specified foreign corporations” (including “controlled foreign corporations”), “passive foreign investment companies” or corporations
that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax.
If a partnership (or any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class
A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, the tax treatment of such partnership and a person treated as a partner of such partnership will
generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding any Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares
and/or Babylon Warrants, and persons that are treated as partners of such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal
income tax consequences to them. This discussion also assumes that any distribution made (or deemed made) on Alkuri Common Stock and any
consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition of Alkuri Common Stock will be in U.S. dollars.
This discussion is based on the Code, proposed, temporary and final Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax
considerations described herein.
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any rulings from the IRS as to any U.S. federal income tax considerations described herein. There
can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions inconsistent with the considerations discussed below or that any such positions would not be
sustained by a court.
THIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
BUSINESS COMBINATION, EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE ALKURI COMMON STOCK AND THE OWNERSHIP
AND DISPOSITION OF BABYLON CLASS A SHARES AND BABYLON WARRANTS. EACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX
ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE FOREGOING, INCLUDING THE
APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF BABYLON
Tax Residence of Babylon for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes
Although Babylon is organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off
the coast of Normandy, France, the IRS may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and therefore a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered a U.S. “domestic”
corporation (or U.S. tax resident) if it is organized in the United States, and a corporation is generally considered a “foreign” corporation (or non-U.S. tax
resident) if it is not a U.S. corporation. Because Babylon is an entity which is organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, it
would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under
which a foreign incorporated and foreign tax resident entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
Under Section 7874 of the Code, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a foreign corporation) will nevertheless be
treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes when (i) the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the
assets held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the U.S. corporation by acquiring the outstanding
shares of the U.S. corporation), (ii) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 80% (or 60% if the Third Country
Rule, as defined herein, applies) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired
corporation (the “Section 7874 Percentage”), and (iii) the foreign corporation’s “expanded affiliated group” does not have substantial business activities
in the foreign corporation’s country of organization relative to such expanded affiliated group’s worldwide activities (the “Substantial Business Activities
Exception”). In order to satisfy the Substantial Business Activities Exception, at least 25% of the employees (by headcount and compensation), real and
tangible assets and gross income of the foreign acquiring corporation’s “expanded affiliated group” must be based, located and derived, respectively, in
the country in which the foreign acquiring corporation is a tax resident after the acquisition. The Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 7874 of
the Code (the “Section 7874 Regulations”) generally also provide that if (i) there is an acquisition of substantially all of the assets held directly or
indirectly by a U.S. corporation after which the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 60% of the shares of the
foreign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation, and (ii) in a related acquisition, such foreign acquiring
corporation acquires another foreign corporation exceeding a certain threshold value, and the foreign acquiring corporation is not tax resident in the
foreign country in which the acquired foreign corporation was tax resident prior to the transactions, then the foreign acquiring corporation will be treated
as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (clauses (i) and (ii), the “Third Country Rule”). The Section 7874 Regulations further
provide for a number of special rules that aggregate multiple acquisitions of U.S. corporations or U.S. partnerships for purposes of Section 7874 of the
Code as part of a plan or conducted over a 36-month period. Moreover, certain acquisitions of U.S. corporations over a 36-month period will impact the
Section 7874 Percentage, making it more likely that Section 7874 of the Code will apply to a foreign acquiring corporation.
Babylon will indirectly acquire substantially all of the assets of Alkuri through the Business Combination. Babylon does not expect the Third
Country Rule to be applicable to the Business Combination. As a result, Section 7874 of the Code may apply to cause Babylon to be treated as a U.S.
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Business Combination depending on whether the Section 7874 Percentage equals or
exceeds 80%, subject to the applicability of the Substantial Business Activities Exception.
Based upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code and the Section 7874
Regulations, and certain factual assumptions, Alkuri and Babylon currently expect the Section 7874 Percentage of Alkuri Stockholders in Babylon to be
less than 80% after the Business Combination. Accordingly, Babylon is not expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under Section 7874 of the Code. The calculation of the Section 7874 Percentage is complex and is subject to detailed regulations (the application
of which is uncertain in various respects and would be
166
Table of Contents
impacted by changes in such U.S. Treasury regulations with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to certain factual uncertainties. Whether the
Section 7874 Percentage is less than 80% must be finally determined after completion of the Business Combination, by which time there could be adverse
changes to the relevant facts and circumstances. Moreover, former Alkuri securityholders will be deemed to own an amount of Babylon Shares in respect
to certain redemptions by Alkuri of Alkuri Common Stock prior to the Business Combination for purposes of determining the ownership percentage of
former Alkuri securityholders for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code. As a result, no opinion of counsel has or will be provided regarding the
application of Section 7874 to the Business Combination. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the status of Babylon as
a foreign corporation under Section 7874 of the Code or that such challenge would not be sustained by a court.
If the IRS were to successfully challenge under Section 7874 of the Code Babylon’s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Babylon and certain Babylon shareholders would be subject to significant adverse tax consequences, including a higher effective corporate
income tax rate on Babylon and future withholding taxes on certain Babylon shareholders, depending on the application of any income tax treaty that
might apply to reduce such withholding taxes.
However, even if the Section 7874 Percentage was such that Babylon were still respected as a foreign corporation under Section 7874 of the Code,
Babylon may be limited in using its equity to engage in future acquisitions of U.S. corporations over a 36-month period following the Business
Combination. If Babylon were to be treated as acquiring substantially all of the assets of a U.S. corporation within a 36-month period after the Business
Combination, the Section 7874 Regulations would exclude certain shares of Babylon attributable to the Business Combination for purposes of
determining the Section 7874 Percentage of that subsequent acquisition, making it more likely that Section 7874 of the Code would apply to such
subsequent acquisition.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that Babylon will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section
7874 of the Code.
Utilization of Alkuri’s Tax Attributes and Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to Babylon and Babylon’s Shareholders.
Following the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S.
corporation and its U.S. affiliates to use U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. taxable income resulting
from certain transactions, as well as result in certain other adverse tax consequences, even if the acquiring foreign corporation is respected as a foreign
corporation for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code. Specifically, Section 7874 of the Code can apply in this manner if (i) the foreign corporation
acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation, (ii) after the acquisition, the former
shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least 60% (by either vote or value) but less than 80% (by vote and value) of the shares of the
foreign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the acquired U.S. corporation, (iii) the Third Country Rule does not apply, and (iv) the
foreign corporation’s “expanded affiliated group” does not meet the Substantial Business Activities Exception.
Based upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code and the Section 7874
Regulations, and certain factual assumptions, Alkuri and Babylon currently expect that the Section 7874 Percentage should be less than 60% after the
Business Combination. Accordingly, the limitations and other rules described above are not expected to apply to Babylon or Alkuri after the Business
Combination.
If the Section 7874 Percentage applicable to the Business Combination is at least 60% but less than 80% and the Third Country Rule does not apply
(as expected), Babylon and certain of Babylon’s shareholders may be subject to adverse tax consequences including, but not limited to, restrictions on
the use of tax attributes with respect to “inversion gain” recognized over a 10-year period following the transaction, disqualification of
167
Table of Contents
dividends paid from preferential “qualified dividend income” rates and the requirement that any U.S. corporation owned by Babylon include as “base
erosion payments” that may be subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax any amounts treated as reductions in gross income paid to certain related
foreign persons. Furthermore, certain “disqualified individuals” (including officers and directors of a U.S. corporation) may be subject to an excise tax on
certain stock-based compensation held thereby at a rate of 20%. However, as a blank check company whose assets are primarily comprised of cash and
cash equivalents, it is not expected that Alkuri will have a significant amount of inversion gain as a result of the Business Combination.
The above determination, however, is subject to detailed regulations (the application of which is uncertain in various respects and would be
impacted by future changes in such U.S. Treasury regulations, with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to certain factual uncertainties. Whether the
Section 7874 Percentage is less than 60% must be finally determined after completion of the Business Combination, by which time there could be adverse
changes to the relevant facts and circumstances. As a result, no opinion of counsel has or will be provided regarding the application of Section 7874 to
the Business Combination. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge whether Babylon is subject to the above rules or that
such a challenge would not be sustained by a court. If the IRS successfully applied these rules to Babylon, significant adverse tax consequences could
result for Babylon and for certain Babylon shareholders, including a higher effective corporate tax rate on Babylon.
U.S. HOLDERS
As used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of an Alkuri Security, Babylon Class A Share, and/or Babylon Warrants, as the case may be,
who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as
created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
•
a trust if (1) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more United States persons have
the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a United States person.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders
Tax Consequences of the Business Combination
The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination will depend primarily upon whether the Business Combination qualifies as
a tax-deferred “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, which is not currently expected to be the case.
For the Business Combination to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, Babylon must, either directly or
indirectly through certain controlled entities, either continue a significant line of Alkuri’s historic business or use a significant portion of Alkuri’s historic
business assets in a business, in each case, within the meaning of Treasury regulations Section 1.368-1(d). In addition, in order for the Business
Combination to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, it generally must satisfy the requirements under either
Section 368(a)(1)(B) or Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code. In order for the Business Combination to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(B) or
Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, it is necessary that a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interests in Alkuri be preserved in the Business
Combination and, in order for the Business Combination to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, it is necessary that Alkuri
hold “substantially all” of its properties following the Business Combination. Sufficiently substantial levels of redemptions would be expected to cause
the Business Combination not to satisfy some or all of the applicable requirements.
168
Table of Contents
Due to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition
companies and the risk that similar levels of redemptions could occur in connection with the Business Combination, the Business Combination is not
expected to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction, including as a “reorganization” under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that is the
case, a U.S. Holder of Alkuri Securities generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to its Alkuri Securities in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between the fair market value of the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants received in the Business Combination and the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in its Alkuri Securities surrendered. Such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss provided that a U.S. Holder’s holding period
for Alkuri Securities is more than one year at the date of the Business Combination. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Alkuri
public shares have suspended the applicable holding period for this purpose. Long-term capital gains recognized by U.S. Holders that are not
corporations generally are eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. A U.S.
Holder should have a tax basis in the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants received equal to the fair market value on the date of the
exchange, and the U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to such Babylon Class A Shares should begin on the day after the Business Combination.
U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Alkuri Securities (generally, Alkuri Securities purchased or acquired on different dates or at different
prices) or who hold both Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants will generally be required to calculate gain or loss separately for each block of Alkuri
Securities and with respect to Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants. Such U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine how the
above rules apply to them, and the discussion above does not specifically address all of the consequences to U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of
Alkuri Securities.
If, contrary to the discussion above, the level of redemptions occurring in connection with the Business Combination were low enough and the
other applicable requirements (including the other requirements discussed above) were met, and the Business Combination were to qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, subject to additional requirements under Section 367(a) of the Code being satisfied
(including, for U.S. Holders that are “five-percent transferee shareholder” of the transferee non-U.S. corporation, as defined in the Treasury regulations,
that they enter into a “gain recognition agreement”), U.S. Holders of Alkuri Securities generally would not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes in connection with the Business Combination. In that case, a U.S. Holder’s basis in the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants
received in the Business Combination would generally equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in the exchanged Alkuri Securities, and the U.S. Holder’s holding
period for the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants received in the Business Combination would generally include the U.S. Holder’s holding
period in the surrendered Alkuri Securities. Special considerations could apply to U.S. Holders who participated in the redemption but also exchanged
Alkuri Securities pursuant to the Business Combination.
No ruling has been requested, nor is one intended to be requested, from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business
Combination. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination is subject to both legal and factual uncertainty, is not free from doubt,
and may change depending on the actual level of redemptions that occur in connection with the Business Combination. No opinion of counsel has or will
be provided regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not
assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to that described above. Accordingly, each U.S. Holder of Alkuri Securities is urged to
consult its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequence of the Business Combination to such U.S. Holder.
Tax Effects to U.S. Holders of Exercising Redemption Rights
Characterization of Redemptions
The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder of Alkuri Common Stock that exercises its redemption rights with respect to its Alkuri
Common Stock to receive cash in exchange for all or a portion of its Alkuri Common Stock will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of
Alkuri Common Stock under Section 302 of the Code or is treated as a distribution under Section 301 of the Code.
169
Table of Contents
If the redemption qualifies as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock by a U.S. Holder, the tax consequences to such U.S. Holder are as described below
under the section entitled “ —Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale of Alkuri Common Stock.” If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of Alkuri
Common Stock, a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences to such U.S. Holder as described
below under the section entitled “—Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Distribution.”
Whether a redemption of Alkuri Common Stock qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of Alkuri Common Stock treated
as held by the redeemed U.S. Holder before and after the redemption (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. Holder, as a result of owning
Alkuri Warrants or due to the ownership of Alkuri Common Stock by certain related individuals or entities in which such U.S. Holder has an interest or
that have an interest in such U.S. Holder) relative to all Alkuri Common Stock outstanding both before and after the redemption. The redemption of Alkuri
Common Stock generally will be treated as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock (rather than as a corporate distribution) if the redemption (1) is “substantially
disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. Holder, (2) results in a “complete termination” of the U.S. Holder’s interest in Alkuri, or (3) is “not essentially
equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.
In determining whether any of the foregoing tests result in a redemption qualifying for sale treatment, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only
Alkuri Common Stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also Alkuri Common Stock that are constructively owned by it under certain attribution
rules set forth in the Code. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and
entities in which the U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any stock that the holder has a right to acquire by
exercise of an option, which would generally include Alkuri Common Stock which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of Alkuri Warrants.
In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of Alkuri’s outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by
the U.S. Holder immediately following the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock must, among other requirements, be less than eighty percent (80%) of the
percentage of Alkuri’s outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately before the redemption (taking into
account redemptions by other holders of Alkuri Common Stock). There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder’s interest if either (1) all Alkuri
Common Stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (2) all Alkuri Common Stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder are
redeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned by certain
family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other Alkuri Common Stock (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S.
Holder as a result of owning Alkuri Warrants). The redemption of Alkuri Common Stock will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if the redemption
results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in Alkuri. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a
U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in Alkuri will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling
that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation where such stockholder exercises
no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.”
If none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, then the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock generally will be treated as a corporate distribution to the
redeemed U.S. Holder and the tax effects to such a U.S. Holder generally will be as described below under the section entitled “ —Taxation of
Redemption Treated as a Distribution.” After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed Alkuri Common
Stock will be added to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining Alkuri Common Stock, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in its Alkuri Warrants or possibly in other Alkuri Common Stock constructively owned by it.

Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Distribution
If the redemption of a U.S. Holder’s shares of Alkuri Common Stock is treated as a corporate distribution, as discussed above under the section
entitled “ —Characterization of Redemptions,” the amount of cash received in the redemption generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income
tax purposes to the extent paid from Alkuri’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.
Distributions in excess of Alkuri’s current and accumulated earnings and profits generally will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against
and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Alkuri Common Stock. Any remaining excess generally will be treated
as gain realized on the sale of Alkuri Common Stock, treated as described below under the section entitled “ —Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale
of Alkuri Common Stock.”
Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale of Alkuri Common Stock
If the redemption of a U.S. Holder’s Alkuri Common Stock is treated as a sale, as discussed above under the section entitled “—Characterization
of Redemptions,” a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received in
the redemption and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Alkuri Common Stock redeemed. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for the Alkuri Common Stock so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains recognized
by non-corporate U.S. Holders generally will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Alkuri Common Stock (including as a result of holding different blocks of Alkuri Common Stock
purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to them.
U.S. Holders who actually or constructively own at least five percent (5%) (or, if Alkuri Common Stock is not then publicly traded, at least one
percent (1%)) or more of Alkuri Common Stock may be subject to special reporting requirements with respect to a redemption of Alkuri Common Stock,
and such Holders should consult with their tax advisors with respect to their reporting requirements.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants
Dividends and Other Distributions on Babylon Class A Shares
Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below under the heading “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” distributions (including, for the
avoidance of doubt and for the purpose of the balance of this discussion, deemed distributions) on Babylon Class A Shares will generally be taxable as a
dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from Babylon’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S.
federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of Babylon’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will
be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Babylon Class A Shares. Any remaining excess will be
treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Babylon Class A Shares and will be treated as described below under the heading “—Gain
or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants.” If Babylon does not provide
calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. Holder should expect all cash distributions to be reported as
dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any such distribution will include any amounts withheld by Babylon (or another applicable
withholding agent). Amounts treated as dividends that Babylon pays to a U.S. Holder that is a taxable corporation generally will be taxed at regular tax
rates and will not qualify for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other
domestic corporations. With respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, under tax laws currently in effect and subject to certain exceptions (including, but not
limited to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment
171
Table of Contents
interest deduction limitations), dividends generally will be taxed at the lower applicable long-term capital gains rate only if Babylon Class A Shares are
readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States or Babylon is eligible for benefits under an applicable tax treaty with the United
States, and, in each case, Babylon is not treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder at the time the dividend was paid or in the preceding year and
provided certain holding period requirements are met. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower rate for
dividends paid with respect to Babylon Class A Shares.
The amount of any dividend distribution paid in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the applicable exchange
rate in effect on the date of actual or constructive receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S.
Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt.
Amounts taxable as dividends generally will be treated as income from sources outside the U.S. and will, depending on the circumstances of the
U.S. Holder, be “passive” or “general” category income which, in either case, is treated separately from other types of income for purposes of computing
the foreign tax credit allowable to such U.S. Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) Babylon is 50% or more owned, by vote or value, by U.S.
persons and (b) at least 10% of Babylon’s earnings and profits are attributable to sources within the United States, then for foreign tax credit purposes, a
portion of Babylon’s dividends would be treated as derived from sources within the United States. In such case, with respect to any dividend paid for
any taxable year, the U.S.-source ratio of such dividends for foreign tax credit purposes would be equal to the portion of Babylon’s earnings and profits
from sources within the United States for such taxable year, divided by the total amount of Babylon’s earnings and profits for such taxable year.
Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants
Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below under the heading “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” upon any sale, exchange or other
taxable disposition of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between (i) the sum of (x) the amount cash and (y) the fair market value of any other property, received in such sale, exchange or other taxable
disposition and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Babylon Class A Share or Babylon Warrant (determined as described above or below), in
each case as calculated in U.S. dollars. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder’s holding period for such Babylon Class A Share or Babylon Warrant exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S.
Holder generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deduction of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of Babylon Warrants
Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below and except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant, a U.S. Holder
generally will not recognize taxable gain or loss on the exercise of a Babylon Warrant. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Babylon Class A Share received
upon exercise of a Babylon Warrant generally will be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment in the Alkuri Warrant in respect of
which the exercised Babylon Warrant was received (assuming the Business Combination is not a taxable transaction under Section 368(a) of the Code,
Section 7874 of the Code, or Section 367 of the Code, as discussed above) and the exercise price of such Babylon Warrant. It is unclear whether the U.S.
Holder’s holding period for the Babylon Class A Shares received upon exercise of the Babylon Warrants will begin on the date following the date of
exercise or on the date of exercise of the Babylon Warrants; in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder
held the Babylon Warrants. If a Babylon Warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such U.S.
Holder’s tax basis in the Babylon Warrant.
172
Table of Contents
The tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant are not clear under current tax law. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a
cashless exercise may be tax-deferred, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S.
federal income tax
purposes. In either tax-deferred situation, a U.S. Holder’s basis in the Babylon Class A Shares received generally should equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in
the Babylon Warrants exercised therefor. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a realization event (and not a recapitalization), it is unclear
whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period in the Babylon Class A Shares would be treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise or on
the date of exercise of the Babylon Warrant; in either case, the holding period would not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the
Babylon Warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Babylon Class A Shares would include the holding
period of the Babylon Warrants exercised therefor.
It is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a
U.S. Holder could be deemed to have surrendered Babylon Warrants with an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price for the total number of
Babylon Warrants to be exercised. The U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value
of the Babylon Warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Babylon Warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in
the Babylon Class A Shares received would equal the sum of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Babylon Warrants exercised and the exercise price of such
Babylon Warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for Babylon Class A Shares would commence on the date following the date of
exercise or on the date of exercise of the Babylon Warrants; in either case, the holding period would not include the period during which the U.S. Holder
held the Babylon Warrants. Due to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, including when a U.S.
Holder’s holding period would commence with respect to the Babylon Class A Shares received, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative
tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise.
If Babylon redeems Babylon Warrants for cash pursuant to the redemption provisions described in the section entitled “Description of Babylon
Warrants” or if we purchase Babylon Warrants in an open market transaction, such redemption or purchase generally will be treated as a taxable
disposition to the U.S. Holder, taxed as described above under “—Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon
Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants.”
The tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the Babylon Warrant
are unclear under current law. Such cashless exercise may be treated either as if we redeemed such Babylon Warrant for Babylon Class A Shares or as an
exercise of the Babylon Warrant. If the cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant for Babylon Class A Shares is treated as a redemption, then such
redemption generally should be treated as a tax-deferred recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case a U.S. Holder should not
recognize any gain or loss on such redemption, and accordingly, a U.S. Holder’s basis in the Babylon Class A Shares received should equal the U.S.
Holder’s basis in the Babylon Warrant and the holding period of the Babylon Class A Shares would include the holding period of the Babylon Warrant. If
the cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant is treated as such, the tax consequences generally should be as described under the heading “—U.S Federal
Income Taxation of U.S. Holders-Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Babylon Warrant.” Due to the lack of clarity under current law regarding the
treatment of a cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the Babylon Warrant, there can be no assurance as
to which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the exercise of a Babylon Warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem
the Babylon Warrant as described above.
173
Table of Contents
Possible Constructive Distributions
The terms of each Babylon Warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of Babylon Class A Shares for which the Babylon Warrant may be
exercised or to the exercise price of the Babylon Warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“Description of Babylon Warrants.” An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. Holders of the Babylon
Warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment to the number of such Babylon Class
A Shares received upon exercise of the Babylon Warrants or to the exercise price of the Babylon Warrants increases the proportionate interest of the U.S.
Holder of Babylon Warrants in Babylon’s assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of Babylon Class A Shares that would be
obtained upon exercise or through a decrease in the exercise price of a Babylon Warrant) as a result of a distribution (or a transaction treated as a
distribution) of cash or other property, such as other securities, to the holders of Babylon Class A Shares, which is taxable to the holders of such shares
as a distribution. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the Babylon Warrants received a
cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
The treatment of U.S. Holders of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants could be materially different from that described above if Babylon
is treated as a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income in a
taxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is
passive income or (ii) at least 50% of its assets, in a taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year),
including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, are held for the
production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than
rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets. PFIC status is determined
annually and depends on the composition of a company’s income and assets and the fair market value of its assets and no assurance can be given as to
whether Babylon will be a PFIC in 2021 or for any future taxable year, in particular because Babylon’s PFIC status for any taxable year will generally be
determined in part by reference to the value of Babylon’s assets and Babylon’s revenues. Based on the current and anticipated composition of the
income, assets and operations of Babylon and its subsidiaries and certain factual assumptions, Babylon does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for
2021. Because Babylon’s PFIC status relies on a number of factual determinations, our U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to Babylon’s PFIC
status for 2021 or future taxable years.
Although Babylon’s PFIC status is determined annually, Babylon will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC in subsequent years in the case of
a U.S. Holder who held Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants while Babylon was a PFIC, whether or not Babylon meets the test for PFIC status in
those subsequent years. If Babylon is determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S.
Holder of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants and, in the case of Babylon Class A Shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either an applicable
PFIC election (or elections), as further described below, for the first taxable year of Babylon in which it was treated as a PFIC and in which the U.S. Holder
held (or was deemed to hold) such Babylon Class A Shares or otherwise, such U.S. Holder generally will be subject to special and adverse rules with
respect to (i) any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants (which may
include gain realized by reason of transfers of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants that would otherwise qualify as nonrecognition transactions
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and (ii) any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to
174
Table of Contents
such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in
respect of the Babylon Class A Shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for
the Babylon Class A Shares).
Under these rules:
•
the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Babylon Class A Shares
or Babylon Warrants;
•
the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to
the period in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of Babylon’s first taxable year in which Babylon is a PFIC, will be taxed as
ordinary income;
•
the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the
highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder without regard to the U.S. Holder’s other items of income and loss
for such year; and
•
an additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder with respect to
the tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the U.S. Holder.
If Babylon is a PFIC and Babylon Class A Shares constitute “marketable stock,” a U.S. Holder may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences
discussed above if such U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for the first taxable year in which it holds (or is deemed
to hold) Babylon Class A Shares and each subsequent taxable year. Such U.S. Holder generally will include for each of its taxable years as ordinary
income the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its Babylon Class A Shares at the end of such year over its adjusted basis in its Babylon Class A
Shares. These amounts of ordinary income would not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital
gains. The U.S. Holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of its adjusted basis of its Babylon Class A Shares over the fair
market value of its Babylon Class A Shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a
result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder’s basis in its Babylon Class A Shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts,
and any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of its Babylon Class A Shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-
to-market election may not be made with respect to Babylon Warrants.
The mark-to-market election is available only for “marketable stock,” generally, stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that
is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure that
the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. If made, a mark-to-market election would be effective for the taxable year for which
the election was made and for all subsequent taxable years unless the Babylon Class A Shares cease to qualify as “marketable stock” for purposes of the
PFIC rules or the IRS consents to the revocation of the election. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax
consequences of a mark-to-market election with respect to Babylon Class A Shares under their particular circumstances.
Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of a PFIC may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences described above in respect of stock of the PFIC (but not
warrants) by making and maintaining a timely and valid qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election (if eligible to do so) to include in income its pro rata share
of the PFIC’s net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current basis, in each case whether or
not distributed, in the first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which the PFIC’s taxable year ends and each subsequent taxable year. In order
to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC Annual Information Statement from the PFIC. Babylon does not
presently intend to provide a PFIC Annual Information Statement in order for U.S. Holders to make or maintain a QEF election. However, as described
above, Babylon does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for 2021.
175
Table of Contents
Subsidiary PFICs
If Babylon is a PFIC and, at any time, has a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally would be deemed to own a
proportionate amount of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if
Babylon receives a distribution from, or disposes of all or part of its interest in, the lower-tier PFIC, or the U.S. Holder otherwise was deemed to have
disposed of an interest in the lower-tier PFIC. There can be no assurance that Babylon will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier
PFIC. A mark-to-market election generally would not be available with respect to such lower-tier PFIC. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors
regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.
PFIC Reporting Requirements
A U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder, may have to file an IRS Form 8621
(whether mark-to-market or any other election is made) and to provide such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. Failure
to do so, if required, will extend the statute of limitations applicable to such U.S. Holder until after such required information is furnished to the IRS.
The rules governing PFICs and mark-to-market and other elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those
described above, including the application of the rules addressing overlaps in the PFIC rules and the Section 367 rules and the rules relating to controlled
foreign corporations. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning
the application of the PFIC rules to Babylon securities under their particular circumstances.
Additional Reporting Requirements
Certain U.S. Holders may be required to file an IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation) to report a transfer
of property to Babylon. Substantial penalties may be imposed on a U.S. Holder that fails to comply with this reporting requirement and the period of
limitations on assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply. In addition, certain U.S. Holders
(and to the extent provided in IRS guidance, certain individual Non-U.S. Holders) holding specified foreign financial assets with an aggregate value in
excess of the applicable dollar thresholds are required to report information to the IRS relating to Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants,
subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants held in accounts maintained by U.S. financial
institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) with their tax return for each year in which they
hold Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to file IRS Form 8938 and the period of limitations on
assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax
advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these rules on the ownership and disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries are subject
to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding generally will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder if (i) the U.S. Holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) the U.S.
Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a holder will be allowed as a credit against
such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

NON-U.S. HOLDERS
As used herein, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of an Alkuri Security, Babylon Class A Share or Babylon Warrant, as the case may be,
who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
a non-resident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States subject to U.S. tax as expatriates;
•
a foreign corporation; or
•
an estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder.
The following describes U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the (i) Business Combination, (ii) exercise of redemption rights and (iii)
ownership and disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants by a Non-U.S. Holder after the Business Combination.
Effects of the Business Combination to Non-U.S. Holders
The U.S. federal income tax characterization of the Business Combination to Non-U.S. Holder generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income
tax characterization of the Business Combination to U.S. Holder, as described under “—U.S. Holders—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the
Business Combination to U.S. Holders” above, although to the extent the Business Combination results in a taxable exchange of Alkuri Common Stock or
Alkuri Warrants, the consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder would be similar to those described below under the heading “ —Tax Effects to Non-U.S.
Holders of Exercising Redemption Rights—Taxation of Redemptions Treated as a Sale or Exchange of Alkuri Common Stock” for a Non-U.S. Holder’s
gain on the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock and a Non-U.S. Holder would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax only to the extent described
therein.
Tax Effects to Non-U.S. Holders of Exercising Redemption Rights
The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder of Alkuri Common Stock that exercises its redemption rights to receive cash from
the trust account in exchange for all or a portion of its Alkuri Common Stock will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the Alkuri
Common Stock redeemed, as described above under “ —U.S. Holders—Tax Effects to U.S. Holders of Exercising Redemption Rights—Characterization
of Redemptions.” If such a redemption qualifies as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Non-U.S. Holder will
be as described below under “—Taxation of Redemptions Treated as a Sale or Exchange of Alkuri Common Stock.” If such a redemption does not
qualify as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock, the Non-U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution, the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of which are described below under “ —Taxation of Redemptions Treated as Distributions.”
Taxation of Redemptions Treated as a Sale or Exchange of Alkuri Common Stock.
Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, if such a redemption qualifies as a sale of shares of Alkuri Common Stock, Non-
U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock,
unless either:
(i)
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, and, if provided in an
applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a “permanent establishment” or a “fixed base” maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the
United States; or
(ii)
the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is treated as present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and
certain other conditions are met, in which case such gain (which gain may be offset by certain U.S.-source losses) generally will be taxed at
a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate).
A Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet point above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the
redemption generally in the same manner as discussed in the section above
177
Table of Contents
under “—U.S. Holders—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants—Gain or
Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants,” unless an applicable income tax
treaty provides otherwise. In addition, earnings and profits of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder that are attributable to such gain, as determined after
allowance for certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an
applicable income tax treaty.
Taxation of Redemptions Treated as Distributions.
Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, if a Non-U.S. Holder receives cash for Alkuri Common Stock in a redemption that
is treated as a distribution from Alkuri on Alkuri Common Stock, the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to a 30% withholding tax (unless otherwise
reduced by an applicable income tax treaty) to the extent the distribution is paid from current or accumulated earnings and profits of Alkuri, as determined
under U.S. federal income tax principles.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the income from such distribution is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of
the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States and, if provided under an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a “fixed
base” maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to regular federal income tax on such distribution
generally in the same manner as discussed in the section above under “—U.S. Holders —Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and
Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants—Dividends and Other Distributions on Babylon Class A Shares,” unless an applicable
income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, earnings and profits of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder that are attributable to such distribution, as
determined after allowance for certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants
Dividends and Other Distributions on Babylon Class A Shares.
Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or
withholding tax on dividends (including dividends with respect to constructive distributions, as further described under the heading “ —U.S. Holders—
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants—Possible Constructive
Distributions”) received from Babylon on Babylon Class A Shares (or, with respect to constructive distributions, on Babylon Warrants) unless the
income from such dividends is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States and, if provided
under an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a “fixed base” maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United
States, in which case, a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to regular federal income tax on such dividend generally in the same manner as discussed in the
section above under “ —U.S. Holders—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon
Warrants—Dividends and Other Distributions on Babylon Class A Shares,” unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition,
earnings and profits of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder that are attributable to such dividend, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, may be
subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
178
Table of Contents
Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants.
Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or
withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants, unless either:
(i)
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, and, if provided in an
applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a “permanent establishment” or a “fixed base” maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the
United States; or
(ii)
the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is treated as present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of
disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case such gain (which gain may be offset by certain U.S.-source losses) generally
will be taxed at a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate).
A Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet point above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the sale
generally in the same manner as discussed in the section above under “—U.S. Holders—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and
Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants—Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon
Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants,” unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, earnings and profits of a corporate Non-
U.S. Holder that are attributable to such gain, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a
rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of Babylon Warrants.
The U.S. federal income tax characterization of a Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of a Babylon Warrant, or the lapse of a Babylon Warrant held by a
Non-U.S. Holder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax characterization of the exercise or lapse of a Babylon Warrant by a U.S. Holder,
as described under “—U.S. Holders—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon
Warrants—Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of Babylon Warrants,” above, although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange, the
consequences would be similar to those described under the heading “—Non-U.S. Holders—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Ownership and
Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants—Gain or Loss on Sale, Exchange, or other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A
Shares and Babylon Warrants” for a Non-U.S. Holder’s gain on the sale or other disposition of Babylon Warrants and a Non-U.S. Holder would generally
be subject to U.S. federal income tax only to the extent described therein.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries are subject
to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding.
A Non-U.S. Holder generally will eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its non-
U.S. status, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI, as applicable, or by
otherwise establishing an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a holder will be allowed as a credit against
such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of Babylon and holders of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants (other than residents of
Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at the date of this document and is subject to changes in such
taxation law and practice. It does not constitute legal or tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice (including such tax law
and practice as they apply to any land or building situate in Jersey). Prospective investors in Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants should consult
their professional advisers on the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise disposing of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants under the
laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.
Taxation of Babylon
Babylon is not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore, Babylon will not be liable to Jersey income tax other than on Jersey
source income (except where such income is exempted from income tax pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended) and dividends on
Babylon ordinary shares may be paid by Babylon without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax. The holders of Babylon
ordinary shares and/or Babylon warrants (other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the holding, sale or other
disposition of such Babylon ordinary shares and/or Babylon warrants.
Stamp duty / transfer taxes
In Jersey, no stamp duty or other transfer tax is levied on the issue or transfer of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants except that stamp duty
is payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to transfer Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants
on the death of a holder of such Babylon ordinary shares and/or Babylon warrants. In the case of a grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp
duty is levied according to the size of the estate (wherever situated in respect of a holder of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants domiciled in Jersey,
or situated in Jersey in respect of a holder of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a
rate of up to 0.75% of such estate and such duty is capped at £100,000.
Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there other estate duties.

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,ALKURI’S BUSINESS,"ALKURI’S BUSINESS
Introduction
Alkuri was incorporated on December 1, 2020 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Alkuri’s efforts to identify a prospective
target business were not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although it initially focused its search for target businesses on
companies operating in the technology industry. Prior to executing the Merger Agreement, Alkuri’s efforts were limited to organizational activities,
completion of its initial public offering and the evaluation of possible business combinations.
Initial Public Offering and Simultaneous Private Placement
On February 9, 2021, Alkuri closed the Alkuri IPO of 34,500,000 Alkuri units (after taking into account the full exercise of the over-allotment option
by Alkuri’s underwriters), with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one redeemable Alkuri Warrant, with
each whole Alkuri Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share commencing 30 days
after the consummation of an initial business combination.
Fair Market Value of Target Business
The target business that Alkuri acquires must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust
account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive
agreement for its initial business combination, although Alkuri may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the
trust account balance. Alkuri’s board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Babylon
Holdings as described in the section entitled “Proposal One—The Business Combination Proposal—Satisfaction of 80% Test” above.
Stockholder Approval of Business Combination
Under the SPAC Charter, Alkuri must seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which
public stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri public shares converted into cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed
business combination or do not vote at all, subject to the limitations described in the prospectus for the Alkuri IPO. Accordingly, in connection with the
Business Combination, the Alkuri public stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri Common Stock converted to cash in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Special Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders—Conversion Rights.”
Voting in Connection with the Stockholder Meeting
In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, including the vote with respect to the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri
Stockholders prior to the Alkuri IPO and its officers and directors have each agreed to vote their Alkuri Common Stock in favor of such proposed
Business Combination.
At any time prior to the special meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding Alkuri or its
securities, the Alkuri initial stockholders, its officers and directors, Babylon shareholders and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares from
institutional and other investors who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination Proposal, or execute agreements to
purchase such shares from them in the future, or they may enter into transactions with such persons and others to provide them with incentives to
acquire Alkuri Common Stock or vote their shares in favor of the Business
183Table of Contents
Combination Proposal. The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions would be to increase the likelihood of satisfaction of the requirement
that the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting to approve the Business Combination Proposal vote in its favor and that
the conditions to the Closing of the Business Combination otherwise will be met, where it appears that such requirements or conditions would otherwise
not be met. While the exact nature of any such incentives has not been determined as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, they might include,
without limitation, include arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their shares, including the granting of put
options and the transfer to such investors or holders of shares for nominal value.
Entering into any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on the shares of Alkuri Common Stock. For example, as a result of these
arrangements, an investor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to
sell the shares he owns, either prior to or immediately after the special meeting.
If such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Business Combination to be approved in circumstances where such
approval could not otherwise be obtained. Purchases of shares by the persons described above would allow them to exert more influence over the
approval of the Business Combination Proposal and the other proposals to be presented at the special meeting and would likely increase the chances that
such proposals would be approved. Moreover, any such purchases may make it more likely that the conditions to the Closing of the Business
Combination are met.
No agreements dealing with the above arrangements or purchases have been entered into as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Alkuri
will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose any arrangements entered into or significant purchases made by any of the aforementioned persons that
would affect the vote on the Business Combination Proposal or the satisfaction of any closing conditions. Any such report will include descriptions of
any arrangements entered into or significant purchases by any of the aforementioned persons.
Liquidation if No Business Combination
Under the SPAC Charter, if Alkuri does not complete the Business Combination with Babylon or another initial business combination by February
9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter), Alkuri will (i) cease all operations except for
the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding
Alkuri public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of Alkuri’s remaining stockholders
and its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to Alkuri’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for
claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the Alkuri Warrants will expire. Holders of warrants will receive nothing
upon a liquidation and the warrants will be worthless.
Each of the initial stockholders of Alkuri and its officers and directors has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any distribution from Alkuri’s
trust account or other assets with respect to the shares held by them prior to the Alkuri IPO. There will be no distribution from the trust account with
respect to Alkuri’s warrants, which will expire worthless if Alkuri is liquidated.
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of Alkuri’s creditors which would be prior to the claims
of the Alkuri public stockholders. Although Alkuri has obtained waiver agreements from certain vendors and service providers it has engaged and owes
money to, and the prospective target businesses Alkuri has negotiated with, whereby such parties have waived any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, and although Alkuri will seek such waivers from vendors it engages in the future, there
is no guarantee that they or other vendors who did not execute such waivers will not seek recourse against the trust account notwithstanding such
agreements. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable under certain circumstances to pay debts and obligations to target
184
Table of Contents
businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to it, but Alkuri cannot
ensure that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally there are two exceptions to the
Sponsor’s indemnity: the Sponsor will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has
executed an agreement with Alkuri waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2)
as to any claims under the indemnity with the underwriters of the Alkuri IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
Moreover, the Sponsor will not be liable to the Alkuri public stockholders and instead will only have liability to Alkuri. Furthermore, the Sponsor may not
be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to as the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of Alkuri and Alkuri has not taken any
further steps to ensure that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Accordingly, the actual per-share redemption
price could be less than approximately $10.00, plus interest, due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an
involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy
law, and may be included in Alkuri’s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of Alkuri Stockholders. To
the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, Alkuri cannot assure you it will be able to return to the Alkuri public stockholders at least
approximately $10.00 per share. Alkuri’s public stockholders are entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of its failure to complete
a business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders properly seek to have Alkuri redeem their respective shares for cash upon a
business combination which is actually completed by Alkuri. In no other circumstances does a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in
the trust account.
If Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, any distributions received
by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor, creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent
conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by Alkuri Stockholders. Because Alkuri intends to distribute the
proceeds held in the trust account to its public stockholders promptly after the expiration of the time period to complete a business combination, this may
be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to its public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from its
assets. Furthermore, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, Alkuri’s board of directors may be
viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to Alkuri’s creditors and/or may be viewed as having acted in bad faith, which may subject Alkuri and
Alkuri to claims of punitive damages. Alkuri cannot assure you that such claims will not be brought against it.
Alkuri will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust account plus the up to $100,000 of interest
earned on the funds in the trust account that Alkuri may use for liquidation and dissolution expenses.
Employees
Alkuri has two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to Alkuri’s matters and intend to
devote only as much time as they deem necessary to its affairs. Alkuri does not intend to have any full time employees prior to the Closing.
Facilities
Upon the Closing, the principal executive offices of Alkuri will be those of Babylon.

In this section, all references to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the business of Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries prior to the
Business Combination, and may also include the professional corporations and limited liability companies that have an exclusive management
services arrangement with a Babylon Holdings entity, and that deliver professional healthcare services to members via its network of employed or
contract providers.
Overview
We are a leading digital-first, value-based care company. Founded in 2013, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable
for everyone on Earth. We believe we are poised to reengineer the global healthcare market to better align system-wide incentives and to shift the focus
from reactive sick care to preventative healthcare, resulting in better member health, improved member experience and reduced costs. To achieve this goal,
we are leveraging our highly scalable, digital-first platform combined with high quality clinical operations and affiliated provider networks to provide an
integrated, end-to-end healthcare solution.
We believe the growing $10 trillion global healthcare market, which is expected to continue to grow over the coming decades, has been unable to
balance the need for accessibility, quality and affordability. These challenges, facing healthcare systems in both developed and developing markets, have
not been properly addressed by the current, largely reactive care delivery model, which is often country or even region specific. While this is generally
referred to as “health care”, we consider it “sick care,” as we believe the traditional fee-for-service (“FFS”) model is designed to focus on treating patients
when they are sick rather than helping them stay healthy. In an effort to address resource scarcity, new healthcare technologies have begun to emerge;
however, we believe that existing digital tools, including telemedicine, are simply shifting the site of care but don’t address the fundamental issues of
when and how care is provided. The frustrations and limitations of “sick care” are spurring a movement towards value-based care (“VBC”), which ties
financial performance to medical outcomes. However, the VBC model has yet to be implemented at scale, given the upfront human capital and physical
infrastructure investment required with traditional care protocols.
We believe our solution reengineers the healthcare value chain by delivering a digital-first, integrated, end-to-end healthcare solution. Our core
solution, Babylon 360, couples our digital platform with a VBC approach, where we assume responsibility for the medical costs for a group of members in
exchange for a fixed fee per member, aligning incentives to encourage better healthcare decision making while maintaining high clinical quality and
excellent member experience. Our digital-first approach enables our members to access the full spectrum of care services, from preventative care, to
consultation, to treatment, to rehabilitation and post-care, through our end-to-end digital platform. We believe that our integrated digital platform allows
us to gather data and insights to continually improve our member experience and their care management. We work with our affiliated providers to take a
proactive approach to members’ health by actively engaging with members through our digital platform, clinical operations and provider networks to (i)
provide actionable insights and information about their wellbeing so that they can set their health goals, (ii) help our members to monitor their health on
an ongoing basis, (iii) intervene early to provide the right care, medication and treatment, including by connecting patients with effective medical advice,
including affiliated licensed physicians available 24/7, (iv) design a clear clinical care plan as needed for recovery and rehabilitation, and (v) transition
rehabilitated patients from sick care to well care. For the approximately one-in-ten members that need in-person care, we leverage our existing network of
affiliated medical professionals in conjunction with existing health plan provider networks and contracted physician networks to provide in-person care,
reducing the need for our investment in resource- and capital- intensive infrastructure. In practice, this structure allows us to reduce the need for costly
member interactions with medical professionals, help prevent unnecessary acute or urgent care visits, and proactively manage chronic conditions.
With Babylon 360, our digital-first VBC solution, we partner with insurance companies, enterprises, governments, and provider networks to deliver
our holistic care solution for a population of identified members.
190Table of Contents
In exchange for providing end-to-end care, including preventative, acute, chronic and specialist services, for the member population, a monthly fee per
member, also referred to as a PMPM fee, is charged. Leveraging the power of our digital-first approach, we engage with these members to help keep them
healthy and avoid emergent visits to lower the overall cost of their care. In addition to Babylon 360, we also offer access to standalone services based on
the Babylon 360 digital platform, including (i) clinical services, where our affiliated providers deliver contracted medical consultations, and (ii) software
licensing through our Babylon Cloud Services offering, where we provide our digital solutions to customers that provide care through their own medical
networks.
As of July 31, 2021, approximately 24 million members had access to our VBC, clinical and/or software offerings in 16 countries across Europe,
North America, Asia, and Africa. We have scaled our VBC offering rapidly over the last year to become one of the largest VBC networks in the United
States, with over 100,000 VBC members as of July 31, 2021, and we expect to remain focused on U.S. growth. Across all of our geographies, results have
been similar: our members gave us over 90% four- and five- star ratings in countries including in the United Kingdom (95%), the United States (98%) and
Rwanda (91%). Once a user has had a digital consultation with one of our clinicians, they have the ability to rate their experience between one and five
stars, with five stars being the best and one star being the worst experience. The rating in the United Kingdom is measured from 2019 to present. The
rating in the United States is measured from 2020 to present and includes rating from our virtual care and Babylon value-based care services. The rating in
Rwanda is measured from 2019 to 2020.
We also have received a 96% quality score from the NHS on NHS Quality Outcome Framework (“QOF”) in 2019 and 2020. QOF is the main set of
quantitative measures used by NHS and the independent quality regulator for England to assess and reward high quality. We achieved 369.1 points out
of 379 points, or 97%, for the clinical domain, 93.5 points out of 106 points, or 88%, for the public health domain and 74 points out of 74 points, or 100%,
for the Quality Indicator domain, receiving in total 536.6 points out of 559 points, or 96%. Additionally, according to a peer reviewed study commissioned
by Babylon Holdings and published in Journal of Medical Internet Research, we have delivered up to 35% acute care cost savings for our members
during the relevant period. The study compared spending per patient for Babylon GP at Hand to the regional average spending over a two-year period
from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 in North West London, where Babylon GP at Hand is based. Moreover, according to an NHS-commissioned report
published by Ipsos MORI, which looked at the use of emergency room visits by patients during each of the 12-month periods before and after joining
Babylon GP at Hand, we have achieved 25% fewer emergency room visits among our members during the relevant period 1.
We establish VBC contracts either as digital-first from inception, or in certain circumstances we acquire non-digital VBC contracts and transition
these to our digital-first framework. As we shift current VBC member interactions into our digital-first framework, we believe that our member management
capabilities and our members’ health outcomes will improve and our cost of care delivery will decrease. Additionally, we expect to be able to rapidly scale
and responsibly care for our growing member base with minimal incremental physical and professional infrastructure. We are driving growth by
expanding our existing service with our current customers into their wider operations and markets, converting more of our customers to the holistic
Babylon 360 solution, and attracting new customers to the Babylon platform.
We have experienced rapid revenue growth in the past year and increasing operational leverage, in particular as we expanded our VBC offerings.
Our revenue was $79.3 million and $16.0 million, our cost of care delivery was $67.3 million and $19.8 million, our platform and application expenses were
$48.7 million and $16.9 million, and our research and development expenses were $35.5 million and $51.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Our revenue was $128.8 million and $22.5 million, our cost of care delivery was $92.1 million and $18.8 million, our platform and
application expenses were $21.4 million and $12.9 million, and our research and development expenses were $17.2 million and $20.9 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 respectively. Our loss for the financial year was $188.0 million and $140.3 million, our EBITDA was $(165.0) million
and $(143.2) million and our Adjusted EBITDA was

The Market: Key Challenges and Developments
In 2019, the global healthcare market was a $10 trillion industry, and it is expected to grow over the coming decades with the aging of the global
population and the expansion of care around the world. However, we believe the global healthcare market remains beset by the following key issues that
limit capacity and effectiveness of care in both developed and developing markets.
•
Accessibility. Access to healthcare services is still restricted for many individuals globally. According to the WHO, more than half of the world’s
population is unable to obtain access to essential health services even in countries with well-established healthcare systems. Accessibility is also
an issue in developed markets – for example, many Americans have limited access to primary care, so they rely on emergency departments for acute
care. In 2018, there were an estimated 130 million emergency department (“ED”) visits in the United States, representing an overall average of 40
visits per 100 persons, and 87 visits per 100 persons in African American populations. We believe inequities in access to health services exist not
just between, but also within, countries, as national averages can mask low levels of health service coverage in disadvantaged population groups.
•
Affordability. Affordability of healthcare is a problem in developed and developing markets at both a system-wide and individual level. At a macro
level, expenditures on healthcare in G7 countries have increased by 37% on average in the last decade, without accompanying improvement in
health outcomes, according to OECD data. Individuals also struggle with high healthcare costs: according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control,
approximately 14% of Americans report problems paying medical bills. Further, unaffordability of healthcare begets inaccessibility – in a 2016 OECD
study, over 22% of people in the United States reported skipping medical consultations due to cost, and 43% of low-income adults reported having
unmet care needs due to cost.
•
Quality. Consistent delivery of quality healthcare remains a challenge across geographies, and healthcare spend does not equate to improved
health outcomes. According to a 2019 OECD study, while the United States spends more on healthcare as a share of its economy than any other
country (16.9% of its GDP), it has lower life expectancy than the OECD country average. Further, in low- and middle- income countries, between 5.7
and 8.4 million deaths each year (representing up to 15% of overall deaths in such countries) are attributed to poor quality care. The inadequacy of
traditional healthcare has not gone unnoticed by individuals, especially those of younger generations: according to a 2019 Accenture report, 32%
of Gen Z respondents reported being “dissatisfied” and “extremely dissatisfied” with the effectiveness of treatment provided by traditional
healthcare services. Across age groups, the United States ranks low compared to other G-7 countries, with only a 30% satisfaction rating among
healthcare participants.
Efforts to address the challenges have led to important innovations in the healthcare industry; however, we believe they continue to have inherent
limitations.
•
Digital Transformation of Healthcare. We believe that patients, payers and governments are aligning on the need for cost containment through
the adoption of digital solutions in the healthcare sector. Demand for and adoption of telemedicine solutions has generally been accelerated by the
COVID-19 pandemic as it has demonstrated its benefit and importance in reaching patients. According to McKinsey, COVID-19 has caused a
massive acceleration in use of telehealth. Consumer adoption has skyrocketed, from 11% of U.S. consumers using telehealth in 2019 to 76% of
survey respondents in May 2020 interested in using telehealth going forward. In the post-COVID-19 world, we believe this trend will continue due
to the inherent structural benefits of virtual delivery of healthcare, including convenience and efficiency. However, we believe that in an effort to
address resource scarcity, existing digital tools, including telemedicine
192
Table of Contents
consultations, are simply shifting the site of care, without addressing the fundamental issues of when and how care is provided.
•
Emergence of New Payment Models. The challenges of accessibility, affordability and quality facing healthcare systems have not been properly
addressed by the current, largely reactive care delivery model, which we refer to as “sick care.” Healthcare providers, paid on a FFS basis, are
rewarded for a higher volume of care rather than successful patient outcomes. This compensation model inadvertently promotes expensive and
more frequent interventions and treatments, leading to higher costs for those responsible for healthcare spend (e.g., governments, employers,
individuals, etc.). This has resulted in a movement towards VBC, which realigns incentives for healthcare providers, rewarding them for improving
patient outcomes rather than increasing the volume of the services they provide. However, the VBC model has yet to be implemented at scale, given
the upfront human capital and physical infrastructure investment required with traditional care protocols.
The Babylon Solution
We believe our solution reengineers the healthcare value chain to simultaneously balance accessibility, affordability and quality by implementing
the key attributes of digital health and value-based care.
•
Accessibility. Our digital-first clinical platform makes information available to members so that they can monitor their health information on mobile
devices, delivering digital-first care in countries as varied as the United States and Rwanda. Our digital-first, 24/7 access to medical professionals
reduces barriers to care and improves timeliness of medical interventions, delivering an interaction with a member every five seconds.
•
Affordability. Our technology platform improves productivity and reduces administrative burdens on medical professionals through the
reallocation of tasks from clinicians to lower cost personnel, and the automation of a significant portion of back-office tasks. Simultaneously, our
holistic care provision model allows us to actively monitor the health of our members and to provide them with targeted preventative and primary
care when needed, reducing the need for expensive secondary and tertiary care. Together, our digital-first care model can dramatically reduce
systemic costs. For example, in the United Kingdom in our partnership with the NHS, we have demonstrated that our solution reduces acute care
costs by up to 35% among our members. For a description of the study done on our solution, see “Babylon’s Business—Overview.” In 2019, the
healthcare expenditure per capita was $4,653 in the United Kingdom and $11,072 in the United States.
•
Quality. Our platform delivers standardized treatment protocols, administrative practices and technology and automation. This allows us and our
affiliated healthcare providers to work from a standardized model of medical intervention, reduce variations in care, and deliver the same quality
standards to all members. We believe this allows us to provide a better member experience and a higher standard of care. The quality delivered by
our system has been confirmed by our members and customers; for example, in the United Kingdom, we received a 96% quality score from the NHS.
Babylon 360, our flagship holistic solution, combines our cutting-edge technologies with human clinical expertise to provide managed care for our
members across the care continuum. Our end-to-end care solution is facilitated through our digital health suite, virtual care, in-person medical care, and
post-care offerings. Our platform empowers users, providers, payers and health systems to generate better health outcomes by addressing the entire care
continuum. By providing more care to members when they are healthy and creating clear and accessible solutions when they are sick, we believe we can
avoid the significant expenses associated with late or avoidable hospital-based care. We believe our platform disrupts the current state of care delivery
and aligns incentives for our members and customers and simultaneously lowers costs for all stakeholders.
193
Table of Contents
When delivering Babylon 360, we and our affiliated providers are able to provide end-to-end care through the creation of a comprehensive, digital-
first “care pyramid” tailored to each member’s specific needs and circumstances.
Each member’s care pyramid is built on a mobile-native, digital self-care foundation that leverages a comprehensive, longitudinal view of a
member’s specific circumstances to provide a range of AI-driven tools to help members create a set of health goals and to track their progress and
achievement. This is complemented by our personal health assistant, which is available to help members with their care needs and for non-clinical
support via chat or direct human interaction. When direct care is needed, it is first provided through virtual clinical consultations, available on a 24/7
basis, linking members with a clinical professional to address their urgent or chronic needs. While most member needs can be addressed with our digital
and virtual tools, when a member does require in-person care, they are seamlessly connected to the appropriate caregiver for an in-person consultation. If
a member’s care needs are more specialized or complex, we offer connections to secondary and tertiary care partners who work with us to provide the full
spectrum of sick care. Our aim, over time, is to shift more and more interactions with Babylon Holdings from the bottom of the pyramid to the top, as
members become healthier and also, increasingly, are able to undertake self-care and self-monitoring.
194
Table of Contents
We believe our holistic care model is presented to the member in an intuitive and consumer-friendly way. We engage actively and frequently with
members, providing the care they need at the point they need it, leveraging existing digital devices as the first point of call and utilizing in-person
providers where needed.
•
When in good health, the tools provided through our Digital Health Suite can provide members with insights and information about their wellbeing.
For example, through Healthcheck, we offer an assessment to help our members understand their current health metrics and how they may change
in the future. We can use some of the information from this tool to help risk stratify our member population. By understanding their specific
information with Health Assessment, members are better able to set personalized health goals. Our Healthcheck tool then provides members a
report, including actionable items to help them achieve those health goals and to help them track their progress and health information.
•
If members get sick, the Digital Health Suite offers 24/7 access to Digital Triage tools including a Symptom Checker as well as a dedicated personal
care team, so members get the right information, care, medication, and treatment as soon as needed. Through our Symptom Checker, members
answer questions about their symptoms and are directed to possibly matching conditions responsive to the information entered and potential next
steps. A personal care team gives members a clear clinical Care Plan for treatment and recovery. Then, once the members are back on their feet, the
Care Team goes back to helping members to monitor their health information.
•
Extensive follow-up care is delivered by affiliated providers, including medication management, transitions to the appropriate type of care, and
rehabilitation. We provide recommendations for follow-up self-care to improve overall member outcomes and ensure that members maintain their
health in the best state possible.
Our Product
Our AI-powered platform allows Babylon to uniquely deliver affordable, accessible and quality care to millions of members around the world to
effectively engage, assess, plan, monitor, treat and support our members, delivering meaningful benefits to our stakeholders.
For members, the journey with Babylon starts with engagement and understanding a total picture of our members’ health needs. We use multiple
channels to reach out to our members, from emails to phone calls to in-person visits with community health workers, to encourage members to install the
Babylon app on their smartphone (or USSD app on their feature phone for regions where smartphone penetration is weak). Once members have installed
the Babylon app, they may (subject to compliance with applicable rules) be continuously
195
Table of Contents
engaged through multiple push-type notifications, emails and SMS which may prompt them to complete a health assessment and create a personalized
care treatment plan unique to their needs. The in-app health assessment, coupled with existing patient EHR data, patient provided data, wearable data and
clinical data, allows for a convenient way to have a holistic profile of our members and to measure aspects of risk to our members.
When feeling unwell or concerned about unusual symptoms, our members can instantly access our AI-powered symptom checker, which will
provide responsive and convenient information. Through our Symptom Checker, members answer questions about their symptoms and are directed to
possibly matching conditions responsive to the information entered and potential next steps associated with such conditions. Information outcomes
range on a continuum from hydrating with water to seeking follow-up care with a clinician or an ER visit.
If a member would like to see a clinician, our app can facilitate a prompt booking for a primary care, behavioral health or specialist’s synchronous
appointment, in many cases on a 24/7/365 basis. In the United States, over 85% of appointments happen within 30 minutes of booking. However, many
clinical needs do not require a synchronous face-to-face appointment. Simple tasks such as birth control or prescription renewals happen
asynchronously. For example, a member fills in a questionnaire and a clinician reviews it at a later point in time where permissible; this feature is currently
available in the United Kingdom, and we plan to make it available in the United States.
For clinicians, Babylon’s platform enables more efficient workflows, thus saving valuable time and allowing clinicians to focus on what’s really
important – the members. Our custom-built, web-based Clinician Portal provides longitudinal data around members and allows clinicians to save time on
arranging lab tests, issuing prescriptions, scheduling follow up consultations and other frequent tasks through workflow automation. The workflow task-
list helps the back-office team manage the transitions of care between providers. Steps are automated using robotic process automation to reduce the
operational overhead. For example, lab test results become available to the doctor via Clinician Portal and doctors get notified to review them.
Future product development
We believe that continuous data assessment is key to understanding patient risks and existing conditions, and that these are critical elements to
crafting care plans. Babylon has under development proprietary AI which will enable ongoing monitoring of member data which will automatically
suggest to clinicians and members relevant goals and actions, while keeping the clinician in the loop to lead to better health outcomes. Once developed,
our systems will detect abnormalities during the course of this continuous data assessment, our team would be proactively alerted to intervene to
evaluate and understand the root cause and respond via email, phone, or notifications.
We are aiming to further reduce the administrative burden for clinicians through the ongoing development of automated note taking and coding. A
leading NLP engine is in development to auto-transcribe clinician interactions in real time and generate meaningful notes and summaries about
interactions. In addition, we are deeply focused on automatically coding our patient conditions to get the most accurate record of their care and
conditions. We expect this to provide improved accountability and transparency with the goal of reducing costly errors and augmenting our data set to
enable future AI solutions. Furthermore, we are very focused on coaching and enabling habit changes that lead to better health outcomes.
The features listed in this section are under active development and have not been commercialized as of the date of this prospectus. We cannot
guarantee if or when the features will be available for use.

Our Strengths and Key Differentiators
Our goal is to provide a full spectrum of care services through a comprehensive digital-first platform supported by an AI-powered, cloud-based,
integrated technology stack. Our key strengths and differentiators are:
•
Purpose-Built, Tech-Enabled & AI-Powered. Our end-to-end healthcare platform is supported by AI, which we believe optimizes efficiency and
improves outcomes across the entire care management value chain, from risk stratification to triage to care management. This digital-first,
technology-forward approach has been our strategy from the outset and is intrinsically built into our care delivery solutions, in contrast to other
care providers that have bolted technology capabilities onto a traditional care delivery model. We have heavily invested in our technology as well
as in our team of highly experienced researchers, scientists and engineers since our founding in 2013, which we believe gives us a significant
advantage over other care providers and will continue to progress our capabilities. We are also able to license our technology to third parties. Our
AI and automation reduce the human capital intensity of providing healthcare, while seeking to improve the quality of decision making and health
outcomes, offering:
•
Evidence-based insights, whole person care, and lifestyle and behavioral risk benchmarking for over 30 common diseases;
•
A cloud-based, integrated self-care and clinical services platform, which allows us to deliver convenient, continuous and scalable care
globally; and
•
Integrated technology and virtual clinical operations, which automate low value tasks, allowing the focus to be on high value interactions
and drive more efficiency than a normal physical primary care operation.
•
Proven & Highly-Scalable Care Delivery Model. Our digital-first model is highly scalable, which differentiates us from competitors as we are able
to deliver fully-integrated, personalized healthcare and access across the entire care spectrum through mobile devices many individuals already
own or access. This technology allows us to offer access to on-demand 24/7 care through our digital platform while leveraging existing, local
healthcare infrastructure in markets where our affiliated providers deliver care. This is evidenced by the rapid go-to-market in Missouri through our
partnership with Home State Health, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centene Corporation, where, within three months of reaching substantially final
agreed terms, we leveraged our digital-first model and Centene’s existing local healthcare network to provide our Babylon 360 solution to
approximately 17,000 members, with limited incremental investment. We believe many traditional integrated care competitors, such as agilon health
and Oak Street Health, are, at best, technology-enabled as opposed to digital-first. As a result, their businesses have shown less and slower
relative scalability due to a lack of end-to-end technology capabilities and use of a capital-intensive bricks-and-mortar-first model which we believe
reduces their ability to expand to new markets and capture segment share beyond their near-term physical footprint. Additionally, because we are
allocated a population of members under our VBC contracts, we are able to focus our outreach efforts on engagement with our allocated members.

financials were based on management estimates consistent with the forecasts provided to Alkuri. This high level of scalability does, however, require that we balance
our growth against the management, operational and financial resources needed to enter new markets.
•
Proactively Delivering Mobile-Native Care to Members. Our digital-first platform allows us to deliver access to integrated, personalized healthcare
at scale through our app on the devices most individuals already own. This enables us to quickly, efficiently and effectively interact with members
to provide support and care, ideally preventing a member from becoming sick. Upon signing a new Babylon 360 contract, we quickly seek to make
direct contact with each member covered under that contract to offer a digital assessment. If required, we also offer to connect members to an
introductory video consultation with a clinician. Following initial contact with the member, we continue to provide proactive monitoring and
communicate electronically through email and the Babylon app to drive member engagement. Our Care Teams proactively offer personalized
healthcare plans for high risk members involving higher levels of interaction with their personal Care Team. Medium risk members also get
personalized care plans with a lower number of interactions with the Care Team and a focus on healthy living coaching and education. Low-risk
members are provided with resources for self-help and education about general wellness. This is automated profiling of an individual (as defined in
UK privacy law) and this requires careful considerations as it involves health data.
•
Deep Experience in Value-Based Care. We aim to improve the member experience and reduce the cost of care by prioritizing member centric care
and incentivizing healthcare providers to keep their members healthy, which can lower healthcare costs over the member’s lifetime. From our earliest
work with customer groups including the NHS, which provides primary care at a fraction of the cost of what is typical in the United States, we have
developed deep experience in the delivery of care within capitated systems. Through the creation of a proactive, digital-first care network, which
provides every member with a well-structured “Care Pyramid”, we shift the majority of member interactions to virtual care and provide timely and
targeted in-person care when needed. With the goal of providing a complete solution, our VBC solution manages the totality of a member’s
healthcare, including taking on full financial responsibility for costs ranging from primary through to secondary and tertiary care settings (with total
risk capped through reinsurance products). By significantly improving accessibility and availability of primary and urgent care, we believe it is
possible to create significant downstream savings. Delivery of our solution in the United
198
Table of Contents
Kingdom, for example, has demonstrated that up to 35% downstream cost savings are possible. For a description of the study done on our
solution, see “Babylon’s Business—Overview.”
Our Growth Strategy
We are pursuing the following strategies in order to expand access to high-quality, affordable healthcare:
•
Expand covered population and scope of services in existing markets. We have a significant opportunity to cover additional lives in the markets we
currently serve by both (i) signing contracts with new payers and enterprise customers and (ii) expanding the scope of services provided to our
existing customer base. If we expand the scope of services we provide, for example, by upselling a clinical service contract to a VBC contract, we
have the ability to increase our current applicable annual run-rate revenue (“ARR”). This is demonstrated by the increase in ARR as of July 31, 2021
to approximately $323 million as a result of the contract which became effective July 1, 2021 from approximately $170 million and $273 million as of
December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively. We continue to demonstrate that our offerings are attractive and cost-saving for payers. In our
partnership with the NHS, we have saved up to 35% of hospital costs, while delivering high-quality healthcare to members. For a description of the
study done on our solution, see “Babylon’s Business—Overview.” We believe that these demonstrated savings will both attract new customers
and convince existing licensing and FFS customers to upgrade to our VBC offering, Babylon 360, and we have already been successful in doing so
– since the start of our expansion into the U.S. market, several customers have upgraded their contracts from initially planned clinical services
provision to Babylon 360 contracts.
•
Expand to new markets with new and existing customers. Thanks to the scalability of our digital-first platform we are able to efficiently expand into
new geographical markets, both within and outside the United States. We believe that our existing customer relationships present a particularly
attractive growth opportunity. Currently, our focus is on the expansion within the U.S. market, but, as a global operator, we will continue to evaluate
opportunities outside the United States. To date we have deployed our technology in 16 countries and actively provide clinical services in three.
We will continue to leverage the deployable nature of our model and technology to pursue business opportunities, both in licensing and clinical
care, in new markets with attractive economic opportunities.
•
Pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions. While we expect organic growth to be our primary driver, there may be complementary targets with
the potential to make valuable additions to our existing platform, either through partnership or acquisition. Recent examples of this approach
include our previously announced strategic partnership with Palantir and our strategic investment in Higi, which augments our digital infrastructure
through a bricks and mortar presence of 10,000 FDA-cleared Smart Health stations in retail chains such as Sam’s Club, Kroger, Rite Aid, and Publix,
among others, with 73% of the U.S. population living within five miles of a Higi station.
•
Continuing to invest our technology to improve our care capabilities. We have invested heavily in our technology platform since our founding and
believe that it is both world-leading and vital to our continued success in the provision of digital-first care solutions. With this view, we will
continue to invest in our technology platform and seek to enhance our leadership position in clinically focused healthcare AI and other
applications that can improve our member health and experience.
Our Technology
To date, Babylon has heavily invested in a proprietary healthcare delivery platform that we believe is member-friendly, reduces administrative
burden for our clinicians, and will enable us to scale across geographies. Our solutions are powered by a cloud-enabled platform that is built to maximize
interoperability, be accessible to individuals through all kinds of mobile devices, and leverage custom workflow platforms to optimize efficiency in
clinicians’ back offices. We believe the key features of our technology platform are the following:
•
Proprietary. Over the last decade, we have designed a proprietary platform on which we can drive the creation of cohesive, custom solutions
powered by AI. In contrast, our competitors rely on many third-party
199
Table of Contents
solutions that are decoupled and disjointed, reducing the ability to leverage AI and data to drive overall efficiency and value for their members and
providers. Our software is built in line with strong security and privacy controls, and our processes are externally audited for compliance with
required standards. We use highly agile software development methodologies to promote effective, metric-driven development while complying
with our secure software development lifecycle.
•
Cloud Architecture. Our globally accessible services are cloud enabled by design for maximum efficiency and scale. Our approach to delivery
allows us to operate in multiple cloud regions around the world with a federated approach that enables unique data residency and data sovereignty
requirements per country. Built from inception to be powered from the cloud, we aim to be cloud service provider-agnostic, enabling us to deploy
our solutions more broadly and globally where there may be a gap in cloud provider coverage through various strategic partnerships.
•
Integration. Using a standards-based, interoperable interface allows us to integrate seamlessly and efficiently with third party electronic medical
records systems and other healthcare data providers. Leveraging a standards-based HL7-FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
approach, we are able to ingest, process and store data from a wide variety of sources, creating a unified view of our members (whilst ensuring this
is in compliance with UK privacy laws).
•
Widely Accessible. We deliver our digital solution to our members and providers via cutting-edge front-end technology through both web and
smartphone applications. At the same time, we serve individuals with basic flip phones through a proprietary application in developing countries
such as Rwanda, facilitating our mission of delivering affordable and accessible healthcare to all.
•
Optimizes Back Office Efficiency. Leveraging open source and third-party technology, we have built a highly configurable platform that automates
non-clinical tasks such as processing referrals and prescription management, reducing providers’ administrative burden and increasing their
operational efficiency. This platform approach allows us to leverage our data and AI strategy to deliver these “back office” workflow services,
driving additional value for our members by mitigating friction and delays, which individuals typically face in traditional healthcare delivery models.
How We Leverage Artificial Intelligence
Underpinning our healthcare delivery platform is our bespoke AI architecture that has been designed to help our members navigate their personal
healthcare journeys. We believe that our member-centric approach, which considers our members’ healthcare and sick-care, differentiates us from our
competitors, whose solutions adopt a narrow, often-times impersonal approach that fails to consider the full spectrum of healthcare. Leveraging our
team’s deep experience in building intelligent healthcare systems, our AI architecture has been designed from the ground up over the last decade to
deliver actionable insights and recommendations.
A core feature of this architecture is the inclusion, by design, of core principles such as interpretability and explainability. These features are critical
when delivering insights through member-facing products since they provide transparency to our clinicians (via our “clinician-in-the-loop” platform) for
them to understand the provenance of the data and parameters in our AI and to have the ability to independently assess the basis of our AI’s
conclusions. These principles, which are inherent features of causal approaches to AI, help overcome the “black-box” problem – the notion that an AI
system can deliver insights, but is incapable of explaining how it has arrived at its conclusions. This capability provides our customers and clinicians
with a critical layer of transparency on the insights provided to our members via products such as the Symptom Checker and Health Assessment.
Another key feature of our AI technology is its ability to quantify the uncertainty of its predictions. In contrast to the majority of ‘black-box’ AI
systems which tend towards making overly-confident predictions, uncertainty-aware AI systems are better equipped to quantify and assess how much
additional information is required to make predictions with a specified level of confidence.
200
Table of Contents
Additionally, our AI has been designed to be data-efficient and flexible with respect to the information it consumes, enabling us to rapidly adapt
our models to new populations. Our AI systems leverage health records from multiple sources where available and in compliance with applicable privacy
rules, but also permit other sources of evidence such as data, for example, clinician input and published studies, and medical knowledge, including from
clinical guidelines and pathways, to be incorporated where data quality or abundance is a concern. For example, our systems benefit from feedback from
our teams of local clinicians who review our AI systems’ use of data in light of local beliefs, language and healthcare concerns. This approach has
allowed us to adapt and rapidly localize our AI models to account for differences in language, culture and disease burden across geographies, enabling
us to serve populations globally.
Our Go-to-Market Model
Working with governments, payers and providers to deliver quality healthcare services globally, we monetize our platform in three primary ways –
software licensing, clinical services and value-based care.
Software Licensing
Through our Babylon Cloud Services offering, we license our digital platform to a broad spectrum of customers, including healthcare providers and
payers. We believe that software licensing represents an effective way of leveraging our technology platform into customer segments or geographies
where we do not currently have commercial operations or a near-term plan to market clinical services or VBC contracts. During the year ended December
31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 31.0% and 34.3%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from software licensing.
Clinical Services
We provide access to our digital platform to customers including health plans, enterprises that offer our platform to their employees, and directly to
private users. Our clinical services offering is tailored to our customers’ needs, but can include access to our full range of digital care tools, including our
app-based Digital Suite (which may be accessed as a per member per month fee and classified as licensing fee revenue), as well as access to
consultations with licensed medical professionals. Our revenue model for clinical services is based on a combination of FFS and capitated fees. Under our
FFS arrangements, payers pay a specified amount for each virtual consultation or patient visit. As a result, FFS-based revenue is demand-driven and
dependent on volume of virtual consultations or, in some cases, patient visits completed. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months
ended June 30, 2021, approximately 36.1% and 14.1%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from clinical services. While clinical services are currently
the largest historical proportion of our revenue, we expect that growth in our other revenue streams will likely outpace it in future periods.
Value-Based Care Contracts
Under VBC contracts, we are able to provide personalized, end-to-end care solutions through the creation of a comprehensive, digital-first care
pyramid tailored to each member’s specific needs and circumstances. Paired with our mix of service support and provider network access, we manage the
totality of a patient’s healthcare, including taking financial responsibility for costs incurred in (i) primary care settings, referred to as professional risk; and
(ii) primary, secondary and tertiary care settings, referred to as global risk.
Under VBC contracts, we proactively manage the healthcare needs of our members in a centralized manner, including under our risk-based
contracts where we negotiate a fixed monthly payment, often based on a percentage of the payer’s premium or Medical Loss Ratio (“MLR”) with the
payer. We receive a fixed fee for and assume financial responsibility for member healthcare services. Through member engagement with our services, and
while maintaining high clinical quality and excellent member experience, we seek to improve member healthcare while keeping the costs we pay for member
healthcare below the fixed fee we receive. Our
201
Table of Contents
cost savings are typically driven by improved management of chronic conditions and proactive, preventative care to keep members healthier thereby
avoiding unnecessary emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Patients, payers and providers are encouraged to adopt our care pathways. We
establish VBC contracts either as digital-first from inception, or in certain circumstances we acquire non-digital VBC contracts and transition them to our
digital-first framework. As we shift all current VBC member interactions into our digital-first framework, we believe that our member management
capabilities and our members’ health outcomes will improve and our cost of care delivery will decrease.
Each VBC contract is different in terms of structure and pricing due to state regulations, national health systems and payer negotiations. Before
entering into a new contract, we analyze internal and external data on a given patient population, including, but not limited to, historical claims,
population demographics, utilization and other key performance data. We perform a full actuarial analysis and combine this information with inflation and
local market adjustments. Because our business is to manage healthcare rather than act as a reinsurer, we also have “stop loss” insurance on all of our
VBC contracts that generally is invoked when expenditures on any individual patient exceeds a predefined threshold in any given year. This insurance is
not material to the overall expense structure and costs up to a few percentage points of revenue. The fees paid under VBC contracts per at-risk patient are
significantly higher than the fees for services provided under FFS arrangements. Consequently, when costs for providing service are effectively
managed, the revenue and profit generation opportunities under VBC contracts are significantly more attractive than under FFS arrangements.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 32.9% and 51.6%, respectively, of our revenue was
derived from value-based care arrangements. VBC is a more recent revenue stream for us, although we expect it to be an increasing proportion of our total
revenue in future periods.
Our Global Reach
As of July 31, 2021, an aggregate of approximately 24 million members had access to our VBC, clinical and/or software licensing offerings in 16
countries across Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa, as further described below.
United States
Since January 2020, we have grown to serve approximately three million members in six states. Over 100,000 of these members were VBC members
as of July 31, 2021. We offer our members 24/7 access to affiliated healthcare providers licensed in all 50 states.
Clinical Services
We began delivering our solutions through our digital platform in the United States in January 2020 by providing access to our digital platform,
including virtual clinical services, on a licensing and FFS basis to health plans across the United States. This business model is consistent with that of
our agreement with Bupa in the United Kingdom, as described below. This model has been, and we believe will continue to be, a valuable entry point into
delivering our holistic Babylon 360 solution to member populations we serve on a clinical fee-for-service and licensing basis. In Missouri, for example, we
offered access to clinical services on a fee-for-service and licensing basis to members through Home State Health, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centene
Corporation, and were able to shift a subset of that population to our full Babylon 360 solution within nine months.
Value-Based Care, Including Babylon 360
Building on our success in making available clinical services to Centene members in Missouri, as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus
today we offer our Babylon 360 solution to approximately 19,000 Home State
202
Table of Contents
Health members through a VBC agreement. This arrangement is a primary example of Babylon’s core strategy in the United States – providing digital-first,
value-based care for which we are paid a pre-agreed capitation rate. After signing the VBC agreement in the summer of 2020, we commenced offering
service access in October 2020, surpassing our own expectations in member engagement with approximately 20% of households registered, improving
health outcomes and accessibility.
We have also acquired non-digital VBC contracts and are transitioning them to our digital-first Babylon 360 framework. Through two California-
based independent physician associations, or IPAs – FirstChoice Medical Group (“FCMG”) and Meritage Medical Network – that were acquired by an
affiliated professional entity, we offer access to VBC services on a capitation basis and carry a combination of professional and global risk for Medicare
Advantage, Medi-Cal and commercial VBC members. As we shift all interactions with these approximately 67,000 VBC members into our digital-first
Babylon 360 framework, we believe that our member management capabilities and our members’ health outcomes will improve, and our cost of care
delivery will decrease.
The expansion of our VBC offerings in the United States, including our digital-first Babylon 360 solution, is our primary focus for growth on a go-
forward basis. We are driving such growth by expanding our existing service with our current health care plan customers into their wider operations and
markets, converting more of our U.S. customers to the holistic Babylon 360 solution, and attracting new customers to the Babylon platform. For example,
we recently entered into an agreement with an existing customer to make our Babylon 360 solution available to approximately 15,000 members in the state
of New York and began deploying this solution in the third quarter of 2021.
United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, we deliver our Babylon GP at Hand in England offering, providing primary medical services under a contract with the NHS,
and provide clinical services through our agreement with Bupa, a private insurer, as well as through agreements with employers for whom we provide
employees access to our clinical services. We provide these services through a mix of fee-for-service and capitated fees.
Babylon GP at Hand
Through our Babylon GP at Hand offering, which we started in 2017, we provide primary medical services for patients registered with Babylon GP at
Hand or temporarily resident in the area and seeking primary medical care. Our reimbursement model is the same as other GPs in England which hold
general medical services contracts and is based on the Carr-Hill formula – a capitation model primarily based on age and gender of the patient. Since 2017,
we have grown our Babylon GP at Hand offering over fifty times, from 2,000 to over 100,000 members, and from one location in London to seven physical
locations in London and Birmingham. Today, anyone who lives or works within 30 minutes of one of our physical premises, irrespective of age and health,
can register with Babylon GP at Hand. We have further improved accessibility of healthcare for our Babylon GP at Hand patients by providing digital
consultation within two hours of a registered patient seeking an appointment compared to over a week, the average for an NHS GP appointment. At the
same time, Babylon GP at Hand has received an overall “Good” rating from the CQC, the independent regulator of health and social care in England. CQC
is responsible for inspecting health and social care providers in England and, based on its inspection, assigns one of four ratings, which are
“Inadequate”, “Requires improvement”, “Good” and “Outstanding”, to five domains, including “Safe”, “Well-led”, “Responsive”, “Effective” and
“Caring”, and an overall assessment covering all five domains. CQC also assigned an overall “Good” rating to Babylon Healthcare Services Limited,
which is sub-contracted to deliver services to Babylon GP at Hand. Additionally, CQC assigned Babylon Healthcare Services Limited an “Outstanding”
rating in the “Well-led” domain. Babylon GP at Hand has over 95% four and five-star ratings from its members, with a 95% retention rate.
We employ doctors, nurses, prescribing pharmacists and other specialists in order to deliver this care to our membership. Our work with the NHS
has demonstrated conclusive cost savings. The NHS’s own studies have shown that our member base has experienced reduced acute care costs by over
35% compared to a similar population.
203
Table of Contents
Bupa
Bupa is the United Kingdom’s largest private health insurer, used by approximately two million people alongside the NHS. Bupa’s covered
population has access to Babylon’s digital platform, for which we are paid a capitation fee per member. In addition, Bupa members can undertake virtual
consultations with our doctors or healthcare professionals, for which we receive a FFS. Following a virtual consultation, if appropriate, we then refer
these members into the secondary care system – either with the NHS or through Bupa’s private network. We do not operate any physical premises in
order to deliver healthcare to these members.
Canada
In Canada, we deliver our Babylon Cloud Services offering via a software licensing agreement. We have entered into a seven-year agreement to
license our white-labeled digital platform to TELUS Health, a healthcare provider, allowing TELUS to provide integrated clinical services to members
through a TELUS-branded version of the Babylon digital platform.
Rest of the World
In furtherance of our global mission to provide accessible and affordable quality healthcare to everyone on Earth, we are continuing to expand our
global reach, beginning in Southeast Asia and Rwanda.
Southeast Asia
In June 2018, we signed an agreement with Prudential, a leading provider of health insurance in Asia, to license our white-labeled digital platform to
Prudential members through the Prudential-branded “Pulse” app. Since then, we have configured our digital platform to offer services across 11 countries
in Southeast Asia, in 9 languages, and including 14 epidemiological models.
Rwanda
In Rwanda, we deliver clinical services on a fee-for-service basis. Since commencing operations in Rwanda in 2019, we have scaled rapidly to cover
2.5 million users in Rwanda today, providing both physical and telemedicine consultations through our network of local doctors, clinical field workers and
other healthcare professionals. Initial funding for this operation was provided in conjunction with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and, following the
initial period, the government of Rwanda signed a 10-year agreement with us for the provision of clinical services. While its revenue contribution is
relatively small, we see Rwanda as a core part of our mission in order to deliver affordable and accessible healthcare to all, and in due course we expect to
seek to expand our delivery further in Africa.
Saudi Arabia
We currently license our symptom checker services to THIQAH Business Services (“THIQAH”) who distribute such services in Saudi Arabia
through an application called SEHA developed by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health intended to decomission
SEHA by July 31, 2021. However, SEHA has not been decommissioned as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, and we do not know whether or
when such decommission will be completed. Moreover, our licensing agreement with THIQAH has expired although THIQAH has continued to distribute
our technology. If SEHA is decommissioned or we fail to renew our licensing contract with THIQAH, we may not be able to operate in Saudi Arabia until
we find an alternative application or application provider and our technology would be deployed in 15 countries instead of 16 countries.
Sales and Marketing
We have a robust near-term contract pipeline of committed and probable contracts totaling approximately $3.6 billion ARR constituting primarily
value-based care contracts by value. ARR at the end of a given month is
204
Table of Contents
calculated at a point in time by multiplying such month’s expected revenue by 12. Our pipeline at announcement of the proposed combination was
comprised of approximately 50 contracts, 27 of which were VBC contracts. VBC contracts on average are worth $130 million ARR, equating to
approximately $3.5 billion ARR. Revenue from VBC contracts are on a capitated basis with a portion of the transaction price being variable due to
provisions for performance-based incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares where amounts received are dependent upon factors such as
quality metrics, member-specific attributes and healthcare service costs. We generally build our pipeline through a combination of responding to inbound
inquiries, outbound sales and marketing efforts, and existing client relationships. While we do not generally find that we are participating in request-for-
proposal (“RFP”) processes in our go-to-market activities due to our unique offering and competitive position, it’s possible that these processes become
more prevalent in the future.
Our marketing strategy is focused on building brand awareness by highlighting our digital-first solution and demonstrating the return on
investment we provide for our existing customers. Our business customers include healthcare providers, insurers, governments, and employers that
sponsor employee memberships as part of their benefits packages. We anticipate increasing our marketing team headcount and are investing in programs
designed to elevate our brand in the market.
Affiliated Physicians and Healthcare Professionals
The corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case
law, in more than 30 U.S. states, all of which we operate in, though the broad variation between state application and enforcement of the doctrine makes
an exact count difficult. Due to the prevalence of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we predominantly conduct our
business, we provide administrative and management services to affiliated professional entities pursuant to which those entities reserve exclusive control
and responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services. We contract with such physician-owned entities
through business support agreements for the provision of back office and administrative support services in exchange for a management fee. We have
entered into option agreements or direct share transfer agreements with the owners of such affiliated entities to allow for timely succession planning. We
expect that the relationships with these affiliated practices and their owner-physicians will continue, and currently have no reason to believe that they will
not, although we cannot guarantee that they will. A material change in our relationship with these physician-owned entities, whether resulting from a
dispute among the entities, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliations, could impair our ability to provide services to our
consumers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Competition
The healthcare industry and, to a lesser extent, the telemedicine and digital self-care industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We
operate in multiple international markets and have demonstrated the ability to provide comprehensive, digital-first, technology-enabled care across the
full healthcare value chain. We are not aware of any public company which compares precisely in terms of breadth and scope. Competitors in the market
are generally focused on one specific slice of the healthcare spectrum, single chronic condition or a single mode of service (e.g., telemedicine) rather than
delivering the entire healthcare needs of a member. These platforms may be technology-enabled, but typically have highly specific physical
infrastructure, or are broad-based integrated care solutions that are difficult to scale.
We view as competitors those companies whose primary business is developing and marketing telemedicine platforms and services. Competition
focuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated services, operational experience, customer support,
extent of customer base, and reputation. The lack of AI and broader member-centric healthcare technology in the more traditional telehealth companies
significantly reduces the actionability of the data collected by the provider and increases the difficulty of robotic process automation. We believe our
digital-first approach is unique, enabling our members
205
Table of Contents
to easily access the advice, support and treatment they need using digital and online tools, and is fully integrated with our clinical operations and
provider networks to provide an end-to-end healthcare solution. Furthermore, in our view, their limited ability to expand the value capture per customer in
turn limits their total addressable market and future growth and valuation prospects.
In the health system market, healthcare systems could be considered competitors, but many have chosen to partner with us to integrate our
capabilities into their own offerings.
While we do not believe there are currently any direct competitors with global reach that offer the full suite of solutions as we do, and believe we
are well positioned to execute our business model and reinvent healthcare with our digital-first approach, we could face significant competition from
traditional health insurance companies in the future. The incumbent healthcare system and health insurance companies are larger than us and have
significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, greater resources, additional access to capital (including utilizing such
capital to acquire or partner with other companies or technologies) and a broader array of healthcare offerings than we currently do. Moreover, as we
expand into new lines of business and offer additional products beyond clinical care and self-care, we could face intense competition from traditional
healthcare systems and health insurance companies that are already established, some of whom also utilize AI, telehealth, ePharma, virtual care delivery
and next generation payer and provider models.
We also compete with new market entrants as well as large communications software players who offer an entry-level priced and simplified offering
for telehealth. Competition may also increase from large technology companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Verizon, or Microsoft, who may wish
to develop their own telehealth solutions, as well as from large retailers like Kroger, CVS Health Corporation, Walgreens or Walmart. With the emergence
of COVID-19, we have also seen increased competition from consumer-grade video solutions, such as Zoom Video and Twilio. We believe that the
breadth of our existing client ecosystem, the depth of our technology platform, and our business-to-business focus on promoting existing healthcare
brands and integrating freely with multiple platforms increases the likelihood that stakeholders seeking to develop telehealth solutions, both within and
outside of healthcare, will choose to collaborate with us.
Competition is based on many factors, including reputation and experience, types of health services offered, pricing and other terms and
conditions, customer service, relationships with public and private health insurance providers (including ease of doing business, service provided, and
commission rates paid), size and financial strength ratings, among other considerations. We believe we compete favorably across many of these factors
and have developed a digital platform and business model that we believe will be difficult for companies in the healthcare and traditional fee-for-service
health insurance space to emulate.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We intend to rely upon a combination of
trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, patents and other legal rights to establish and protect our
intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention of work product assignment agreements with our employees and
consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
Our material intellectual property includes (without limitation) core items of our software, such as our Digital Health Suite mobile app and its
features, including our AI-enabled products such as the Symptom Checker and Health Assessment (which are also licensed to certain customers to
integrate into their own products). Our material intellectual property also includes certain AI technologies underlying the Symptom Checker and Health
Assessment products. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and other legal rights to protect these software products and
related technologies.
The use of patent protection, with a focus on the United States, is part of our intellectual property strategy. As of September 14, 2021, we own 15
granted U.S. utility patents and have 23 utility U.S. patent applications
206
Table of Contents
pending (four of which have been accepted for grant by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office but are currently proceeding through grant formalities).
These granted patents and applications primarily relate to our AI technologies in the fields of probabilistic reasoning and decision-making and natural
language processing for healthcare. Some of these technologies are used in our AI-enabled products such as the Symptom Checker and Health
Assessment, including their medical reasoning and decision-making and conversational features, to facilitate an improved understanding of our members.
We rely on trademarks to protect the Babylon brand. As of September 14, 2021, we hold 76 foreign registered trademarks and two registered
trademarks in the United States, have 14 trademark applications pending and no U.S. trademark applications. Our registered trademark portfolio primarily
seeks to protect the name BABYLON and our heart logo for relevant goods and services.
We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. Intellectual property laws,
procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented,
infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States,
and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership
We believe that leadership in environment, social and governance (“ESG”) issues is central to our mission of putting accessible, affordable, and
quality health services in the hands of everyone on Earth. Having a positive impact on our employees, customers, partners and the environment, with
leadership that is accountable to our stakeholders, is critically important to our business.
We have examined and taken steps to address the ESG risks and opportunities of our operations, products and services. As our ESG efforts
progress, we plan to report how we oversee and manage ESG issues and evaluate our ESG objectives by using industry-specific frameworks such as the
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and elements of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Our ESG initiatives are organized into three pillars, which, in turn, contain focus areas for our attention and action.
Our environmental pillar is focused on our commitment to being net zero by 2050, doing our part in reversing the deleterious impacts of climate
change on the health of our planet and people. As a first step, we are measuring our global Scope 1-3 GHG emissions to set a benchmark and expect to
publish our emissions data and interim targets by the end of 2021. We solidified our net zero commitment by becoming a member of Tech Zero, a climate
action group that is a partner to the United Nation’s Race to Zero campaign, established to promote a healthy, resilient, zero carbon recovery.
Our social pillar is focused on serving the needs of our people, our members, and other stakeholders.
•
Addressing Healthcare Inequalities. Our business mission is intrinsically tied to our social pillar: making high-quality healthcare accessible and
affordable for everyone. Underpinning our mission is a commitment to addressing inequalities in healthcare faced by those with low incomes and
who live in low resource settings. Whether it is partnering with the Rwandan government to help fulfill its pledge to provide universal healthcare
access, or expanding to offer value-based care to Medicaid recipients, we remove barriers to healthcare by customizing our model and services to
meet the unique needs of our members.
•
Talent Attraction, Engagement and Retention. Our ability to attract a skilled workforce of engineers, mathematicians, scientists and healthcare
practitioners, and a diverse workforce reflective of our members, is critical to meeting our mission and achieving results for our members, healthcare
partners, shareholders and other
207
Table of Contents
stakeholders. Reward at Babylon ensures that we all share in our collective success and align long-term incentives through bonus and stock
awards or options. We extend our mission to our employees, encouraging healthy lifestyles, emotional and physical well-being and a work-life
balance through flexible work arrangements, healthy lifestyle perks, such as free yoga classes and healthy snacks, and health and well-being
support from health advocates, mental health first aiders and well-being circles. Our Be Brilliant performance management framework ensures at
least bi-annual performance reviews and career pathway mapping.
•
Diversity and Inclusion. With employees hailing from 60 countries and counting, Babylon’s diversity is a cornerstone of our culture. Our Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) program is incorporated across organizational departments, levels, and activities. Our Power of Diversity Resource
Groups, which include Black Alliance Network, Women in Tech Health, LGBT Allies, and Interfaith, provide support to members and an avenue for
groups to advise senior stakeholders on DEI and business direction goals. Each group is provided an executive sponsor and budget to deliver
events and educational programs throughout the year. Our corporate holiday calendar and events are inclusive of a range of identities and
backgrounds, such as the inclusion of a variety of religious holidays such as Eid al-Fitr, Diwali, Christmas and others. Our DEI engagement scores
have demonstrated our efforts are working, with our most recent score being 8.2 out of 10.
•
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity. We know that our success is predicated on members trusting us to responsibly manage their most sensitive data
and keep it safe and secure. Our data privacy and information security organizations work with business units from design to delivery, keeping our
members in mind at every step. Our information security team represents 1% of our headcount and is led by our Vice President of Information
Security, who reports directly to our CTO. Our Information Security Management System is certified to ISO 27001 and SOC Type II, and we are
aiming to be HiTrust certified by 2021-year end. The team’s primary focus is securing our platforms through which most of our services are
delivered. Our mindset of ‘security by design’ means that security is considered a quality aspect of our product, embedded in product design from
outset, rather than added as an overlay post-design. We consider a product with lower level of security to be a product with a lower level of quality.
Our Data Privacy team is led by our Data Protection Officer who reports to the CFO. The team helps us to uphold members’ right to privacy and
control of their data. We provide transparency about data uses and end user control–expressed consent must be given for AI learning (personal
identifiers always removed), product improvement and marketing. We will never sell data. We also strictly comply with applicable jurisdictional
regulations, such as HIPAA, the DPA 2018 and GDPR, ensuring we keep current through extensive horizon scanning and risk register maintenance.
Our Governance Pillar is focused on our commitments to ethics and enterprise risk management.
•
Ethical Conduct. We uphold the highest standards of ethical business conduct, integrity and responsibility by ensuring employees strictly adhere
to our policies that include our Code of Ethics and Conduct, Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, and Whistleblower Policy.
•
Board Oversight of ESG. Oversight provided by the Board and subcommittees is focused on cyber security, clinical governance, and other key risk
and compliance issues, Our Global Risk and Compliance (“GRC”) Framework, overseen by a GRC team, is integral to our enterprise risk management
efforts. A GRC committee meets quarterly and reports to our Board’s Audit Committee.
All of our actions and each of our ESG pillars are underpinned by our vision to be a leading digital-first, value-based care company where
healthcare revolves around the patient.
Employees
As of September 6, we employed approximately 2,189 individuals globally, of which approximately 1,864 were permanent. None of our employees in
the United States are represented by unions or party to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good
and have not experienced interruptions to operations due to labor disagreements.
208
Table of Contents
Properties
Our corporate headquarters are currently located at 1 Knightsbridge Green, London SW1X 7QA, United Kingdom, for which the term of our lease
expires in September 2024.
We believe that our properties are generally suitable to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we require additional
space in the future, we believe that it would be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
Regulatory Environment
The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which
continue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are significant. Our profitability depends in part
upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers and independent contractors, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all
applicable licenses. A review of our operations by regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations, or the
healthcare legal or regulatory environment could change in ways that restrict or otherwise impact our operations. To the extent that any of our employees
or third-party contractors engages in any misconduct or activity in violation of an applicable law, we may be subject to increased liability under the law or
increased government scrutiny. If any action is instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, such
action could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Our operations may be adversely
affected or disrupted due to restrictions imposed on third parties. Complying with any new legislation and regulations could be time-intensive and
expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
As a digital health or a telehealth platform company, our operations are subject to United States federal, state and local and international regulation
in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring
developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in
our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the
subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be certain that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not
result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our
operations.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the United States, state and federal regulatory authorities temporarily loosened or waived certain
regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example,
many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other healthcare professionals licensed in other states to practice in their state
without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure or registration process. In addition, changes were made to
the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through legislative changes, and the exercise of regulatory discretion and authority) to increase access to
telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior
authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue
beyond this public health emergency period.
We believe that a return to the status quo would not have a materially negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during
2020. Each of these agreements has a defined term and virtually none allow for immediate termination for convenience by the customer in question. For
many healthcare companies engaging in telehealth, the most significant potential concern about returning to the status quo is that restrictions on the
reimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries could be re-imposed.
209
Table of Contents
We do not believe that the visit volume on our platform or visit revenue will materially decrease based on a return to the status quo from a
regulatory perspective.
Medical Provider Licensing, Practice of Medicine and Related Laws
The delivery of health care services is subject to state, federal, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards,
relating to, among other things, the standard or adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care), equipment,
personnel, operating policies and procedures, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of
these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretations.
Physicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in
the state or local jurisdiction in which the patient is located. We have established systems to confirm our affiliated physicians are appropriately licensed
under applicable state or local law and that their provision of telehealth to members is delivered in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth,
although these subjects necessarily depend in some instances on collection of accurate information from patients. Depending on the jurisdiction, failure
to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the physicians, our services being found to be non-reimbursable, or
prior payments being subject to recoupment, an interruption of the services we deliver, and/or civil, criminal or administrative penalties.
Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the United States; Fee Splitting
State corporate practice laws prohibit lay entities (i.e., entities that are not owned by a licensed healthcare professional, like Babylon Holdings),
from practicing medicine. To comply with the requirements of these prohibitions, we contract with affiliated physician organizations to provide health care
services to customers and members. Under these arrangements, our platform is used by the affiliated physician organizations to facilitate the delivery of
telehealth services by the affiliated physician organizations and their patients in accordance with the customer and member contracts. Under these
arrangements we also provide our affiliated physician organizations with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other administrative and management
services, and they pay us for those services via management and other service fees. These arrangements are also subject to state fee splitting and state
and federal anti-kickback and similar laws that restrict or define the kinds of financial relationships we can have with our affiliated physician
organizations.
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state, and from federal anti-kickback prohibitions. In
addition, these requirements are subject to interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do
not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of
the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the
prohibited corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such
event, failure to comply could lead to significant adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or
administrative penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of
engagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.
HIPAA, GDPR and Other Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In the U.S., numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability,
integrity, and other processing of protected health information (“PHI”) and personally identifiable information (“PII”). In the UK, this is known as
‘personal data’ and ‘special category data’ (the latter includes health data which attracts stronger protections under the UK Privacy laws). These laws
and regulations include HIPAA. HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of
210
Table of Contents
protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the
business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. We are business associates under HIPAA and we execute business associate
agreements with our customers.
HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, such as us, to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is
used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the
use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare
transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.
HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations start at $119 per
violation and are not to exceed $59,522 per violation, subject to a cap of $1.786 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year.
However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of
their residents. Courts may award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a
private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in
state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.
In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered
entities and business associates for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology
whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the
violator.
HIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that
compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees
or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days
after discovery of the breach.” If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the
name of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the
local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and
security of PHI and other types of PII. These laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its
implementing rules. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changed or differing interpretations, and we expect new
laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in the future.
Outside of the United States, we, along with a significant number of our customers, are subject to laws, rules, regulations, guidance and industry
standards related to data privacy and cyber security, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection,
retention or transfer of data. For example, GDPR and, now that the U.K. has exited the European Union, the DPA 2018 and U.K. GDPR contain numerous
requirements and changes from previous European Union law, including more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers and heavier
documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Specifically, the numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the
EU were introduced, including greater control over personal data by data subjects (e.g., the “right to be forgotten”), increased data portability for EU
consumers, data breach notification requirements (which differ to those listed under HIPAA above, if required report within 72 hours of becoming aware
of the breach, and potentially also the requirement to notify affected data subjects) and increased fines. In particular, under the GDPR and the DPA
211
Table of Contents
2018, fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for certain
violations. The GDPR and DPA 2018 requirements apply not only to third-party relationships, but also to transfers of information between us and our
subsidiaries, including employee information. We are required to comply with the GDPR and DPA 2018 as a “Data Controller” and a “Data Processor.” In
2018, we appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee and supervise our compliance with GDPR and DPA 2018 data protection regulations. As a result
of various changes in relation to European data transfer rules (i.e. CJEU Schrems II, EDPB guidelines on supplementary measures, new EU Standard
Contractual Clauses and possibly new UK Standard Contractual Clauses in the coming months) all intra-group or outside of the group existing and future
transfers of European originated personal data will have to be assessed and possible revisited to take into consideration the changes. This is likely to
trigger specific remediation costs and expenses in 2021 and 2022.
Globally, governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards
covering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, online, the use of data to inform
marketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use,
processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users. New regulation or legislative actions regarding
data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase the costs of doing business and could have a material adverse
impact on our operations and cash flows. Further, given the risk and penalties associated with this area, commercial contractual liability and indemnity
provisions relating to data protection breaches and incidents can be particularly onerous, leading to risks of punitive damages/penalties in the event of a
breach.
While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the GDPR and the DPA 2018 on us and despite our ongoing efforts to bring practices into
compliance, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control, such as limited financial or human resources, or other factors
outside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the GDPR, leading to potential
inconsistencies amongst various EU member states. Indeed, case law rulings can be inconsistent and unprecedented in this area, leading to more
uncertainty regarding acceptable levels of compliance. Any failure or perceived failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures, or
measures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, or customer communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or
contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and
enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers lose trust in us, which could have an adverse
effect on our reputation and business.
This complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection, and information security creates significant compliance issues for us and
our customers and potentially exposes us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. While we have implemented data privacy and security
measures in an effort to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection, some PHI and other PII or confidential
information is transmitted to us by third parties, who may not implement adequate security and privacy measures, and it is possible that laws, rules and
regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices
or those of third parties who transmit PHI and other PII or confidential information to us. If we or these third parties are found to have violated such laws,
rules or regulations, it could result in government-imposed fines, orders requiring that we or these third parties change our or their practices, or criminal
charges, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or
require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.
We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing,
consumer communications and information security in the United States, the
212
Table of Contents
European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.
Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop
and market new services and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
The U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and
regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payers, our
contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular
importance are:
•
the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring
Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such
physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the
entity, and prohibit the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services;
•
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other
remuneration (i) in return for referring or to induce the referral of an individual for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of items or services
paid for in whole or in part by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) ordering, leasing, purchasing or
recommending or arranging for the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items, services, good, or facility paid for in whole or in part by any federal
health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to
violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
•
the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HITECH, HIPAA, and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to
defraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent
statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a
person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•
the federal False Claims Act that imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that, among other things, knowingly submit false or fraudulent
claims for payment to the government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid, or retain
identified Medicare or Medicaid overpayments, and allows for qui tam or whistleblower suits by private individuals on behalf of the government;
•
various federal healthcare-focused criminal laws that impose criminal liability for intentionally submitting false or fraudulent claims, or making false
statements, to the government;
•
reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the Medicare or
Medicaid programs;
•
similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services
reimbursed by any payer, including patients and commercial insurers;
•
state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging
in some practices such as splitting fees with physicians;
213
Table of Contents
•
state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies requiring certain modality and other actions to establish a provider-patient
relationship, deliver care, or prescribe medications as part of a telehealth service;
•
state laws, regulations and policies relating to licensure and the practice of telehealth services across state lines;
•
state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding the dispensing or delivery of medications and devices;
•
state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding reporting requirements and patient consent, education, and follow-up related
to treatment, including treatment and education for certain specific topics, such as, contraception, HIV and other STIs and state reporting for HIV,
STI, and infectious diseases;
•
laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;
•
a provision of the Social Security Act that imposes penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose, or refund known overpayments;
•
federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are
medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered;
and
•
federal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to maintain licensure, certification or accreditation to enroll and participate in
the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our
business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove
costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment,
imprisonment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws
and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions
are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any
other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of
these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention
from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.
To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the OIG has recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers, which has led to a number of
investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming
and can divert management’s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse
effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble
damages and penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for
significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and heavy penalties that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such
settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity
agreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources
to investigating healthcare providers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
The laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you
that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not
214
Table of Contents
materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation
authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.
Healthcare Regulation Worldwide
United Kingdom
The regulator of health services at a system level in England is the CQC. Any provider of certain regulated healthcare activities in England must be
registered with the CQC, and it is an offence for an unregistered person to provide such services. The CQC monitors, inspects and regulates such
providers to make sure they meet fundamental standards of quality and safety and it publishes what it finds, including performance ratings to help people
choose care.
Where a CQC inspection finds deficiencies in the service provision, it will make recommendations for improvement and the CQC generally aims to
work in cooperation with healthcare providers to ensure voluntary compliance. However, where this is not possible, the CQC has powers to take
enforcement action, including:
•
issuing requirement notices or warning notices to set out what improvements a provider must make;
•
making changes to a provider’s registration to limit what they may do;
•
issuing cautions or fines; and/or
•
prosecuting cases where people are harmed or placed in danger of harm.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency regulates the elements of our products which are categorized as medical devices.
Canada
The healthcare regulatory requirements in Canada apply primarily to individual practitioners rather than at a system level to service providers.
Within primary care, the main requirement is that the individual practitioner is in good standing with the relevant provincial professional regulatory body
(generally the provincial College of Physicians). We, Babylon, as a healthcare services and technology provider, are not subject to such regulatory
oversight.
Rwanda
Our services in Rwanda are regulated by the Rwandan Ministry of Health, both through its overall responsibility for healthcare provision within
Rwanda and through contractual mechanisms contained within its contract with us.
Medical Device Regulation
Some of Babylon’s digital software products are considered medical devices in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Specifically, our
symptom checker (“Triage”) and our health assessment tool (“Healthcheck”) are registered as medical devices with the UK Medicines and Healthcare
Product Regulatory Agency and the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority. Both products are placed on the UK market bearing the European CE
mark, indicating conformity to EU medical device legislation; both current products are placed on the market under the EU MDD. As per the Brexit
Transition Treaty, the UK accepts the CE mark as evidence of conformity until June 2023. However, neither Triage nor Healthcheck has been
independently tested or approved by a notified body.
Babylon considers that Triage and Healthcheck are qualified for enforcement discretion in the US, meaning no registration with the FDA is required.
215
Table of Contents
Babylon’s current products are not considered medical devices in other jurisdictions where the products are marketed, including Malaysia, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Canada and Rwanda. Babylon has confirmed the
regulatory position in these jurisdictions with local regulators.
ISO 13485
Regulatory requirements are increasingly stringent throughout every step of a product’s life cycle, including service and delivery. Increasingly,
organizations in the industry are expected to demonstrate their quality management processes and ensure best practice in everything they do. ISO 13485,
issued by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, is the medical device industry’s internationally agreed standard, sets out the
requirements for a quality management system specific to the medical devices industry.
Our quality management system, in which our medical devices have been developed, has been independently assessed and certified by a notified
body to EN ISO 13485:2016 standard.
DCB 0129/0160 (National Health Service U.K. standards for design and implementation of digital health technologies)
DCB 0129 is the clinical risk management standard which manufacturers of health IT systems and apps need to comply with. The standard is
governed by NHS Digital and compliance is mandatory under the U.K. Health and Social care Act 2012. Digital health technology can introduce as well as
mitigate clinical risk. NHS Digital requires that organizations who manufacture health IT systems and apps undertake a formal risk assessment and
evidence the measures which have been put in place to mitigate risk. Proactively demonstrating that a product is safe helps to protect from litigation and
visibly demonstrates best-practice to customers. To comply with the standard, we undertake a formal risk assessment on the product and produces three
documents summarizing the outcome: the Clinical Risk Management Plan, Hazard Log and Clinical Safety Case Report.
UK Medical Device Regulation
For the purposes of a post-Brexit Great Britain, the EU MDD, amongst others, is given effect in UK law through the Medical Devices Regulations
2002, as amended (the “UK MDR”). The UK MDR continue to have effect in Great Britain after the Brexit transition period. This means that since January
1, 2021, the Great Britain route to market and labelling requirements is still based on the requirements derived from the EU MDD. The UK MDR does not
currently include any of the amendments that are made by, amongst others, the new EU Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 (the “EU MDR”), which
came into effect in the EU after the Brexit transition period. Accordingly, the EU MDR shall not automatically apply in Great Britain. Instead, the recent
Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 supplements the UK MDR.
International Regulation
We expect over time to continue to expand our operations in foreign countries through growth and acquisitions. In such a case, our international
operations will be subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-
corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data
protection, data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations;
discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the
expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of
U.S. law, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption
laws that apply in countries where we do business.
216
Table of Contents
The Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering,
or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain
business or gain some other business advantage. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from
committing a bribery offense. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations. In addition, we
cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which
existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments
of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions
and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations,
collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. We may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all such applicable laws, which
could result in our being subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses. Likewise,
any investigation of any potential violations of such laws by United Kingdom, United States or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on
our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We and our products are subject to U.S. import and export controls and trade and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury
Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and solutions to certain countries,
governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Exports of our products and services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations.
If in the future we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal penalties, including loss of
export privileges and substantial fines for us and for the individuals working for us.
In addition, changes in our solution, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our members with international operations
from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solution to certain countries, governments or persons
altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation or change in the countries, governments, persons or
technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to
our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or
sell our solution would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Legal Proceedings
We are a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcomes of
these matters are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,ALKURI’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,"ALKURI’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of Alkuri’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Alkuri’s financial statements
and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Please see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Alkuri’s actual results may differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those described under “Risk Factors” and
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified the following critical accounting policies. For a more detailed discussion of Alkuri’s Accounting Policies, please see Note 2 to
the financial statements of Alkuri included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Warrant Liability
Alkuri accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms
and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants
are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the
requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to Alkuri’s own ordinary shares, among other
conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and
as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of
additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are
required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the
warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using a Modified Black
Scholes approach which includes a Monte Carlo simulation.
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
Alkuri accounts for its Alkuri Common Stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480
“Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at
fair value. Conditionally convertible Alkuri Common Stock (including Alkuri Common Stock that features redemption rights that are either within the
control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within Alkuri’s control) is classified as temporary
equity. At all other times, Alkuri Common Stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Alkuri Common Stock features certain redemption rights that are
considered by Alkuri to be outside of Alkuri’s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events.
Net Loss Per Common Share
Net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of Alkuri Common Stock outstanding during the
period, excluding shares of Alkuri Common Stock subject to forfeiture. Alkuri has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Alkuri IPO and
private placement to purchase an aggregate of 14,558,333 shares in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants are
contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.
219Table of Contents
Alkuri’s statement of operations includes a presentation of loss per share for Alkuri Common Stock subject to possible redemption in a manner
similar to the two-class method of loss per share. Net loss per common stock, basic and diluted, for Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible
redemption is calculated by dividing the proportionate share of loss on marketable securities held by the Alkuri trust account by the weighted average
number of Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption outstanding since original issuance.
Net loss per share, basic and diluted, for non-redeemable Alkuri Common Stock is calculated by dividing the net loss, adjusted for loss on
marketable securities attributable to Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption, by the weighted average number of non-redeemable
Alkuri Common Stock outstanding for the period.
Non-redeemable Alkuri Common Stock includes Alkuri Class B Common Stock and non-redeemable shares of Alkuri Common Stock as these shares
do not have any redemption features. Non-redeemable Alkuri Common Stock participates in the income or loss on marketable securities based on non-
redeemable shares’ proportionate interest.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Alkuri’s management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a
condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,
could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Alkuri’s management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a
material effect on Alkuri’s condensed financial statements.
In August 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-
06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion
and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of
contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are
indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-
converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis,
with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Results of Operations
Alkuri has neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from December 1, 2020 (inception) through
June 30, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company
for a business combination. Alkuri does not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination.
220
Table of Contents
We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Alkuri trust account. Alkuri incurs expenses as a
result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Alkuri incurred a net loss of $7,623,476, which primarily consisted of operation and formation costs of
$5,266,438, the change in fair value of the warrant liability of $2,388,667, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in Alkuri trust account and
bank account of $22,618. Transaction costs associated with the issuance of the Alkuri Warrants of $645,038 are included in operation and formation costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On February 9, 2021, Alkuri completed the Alkuri IPO of 30,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $300,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Alkuri IPO, Alkuri completed the sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to the Sponsor at a price of $1.50 per
private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000.
On February 9, 2021, in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full in the Alkuri IPO, Alkuri completed the sale of
an additional 4,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $45,000,000.
Following the Alkuri IPO, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $345,000,000 was
placed in the Alkuri trust account. Alkuri incurred $19,500,194 in Alkuri IPO related costs, including $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, 12,075,000 of deferred
underwriting fees and $525,194 of other costs.
For the six months ended June 30, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $1,509,500. Net loss of $7,632,476 was affected by interest earned on
marketable securities held in the Alkuri trust account of $22,618, the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of $2,388,667 and transaction costs
associated with the Alkuri IPO of $645,038. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $3,111,889 of cash for operating activities.
As of June 30, 2021, Alkuri had marketable securities held in the Alkuri trust account of $345,022,618 (including $22,618 of interest income)
consisting of money market funds which are invested primarily in U.S. treasury securities. Interest income on the balance in the Alkuri trust account may
be used by us to pay taxes. Through June 30, 2021, Alkuri has not withdrawn any interest earned from the Alkuri trust account.
Alkuri intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Alkuri trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the
Alkuri trust account (less income taxes payable), to complete a business combination. To the extent that Alkuri’s capital stock or debt is used, in whole or
in part, as consideration to complete a business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Alkuri trust account will be used as working capital to
finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue Alkuri’s growth strategies.
As of June 30, 2021, Alkuri had cash of $70,821. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target
businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and
structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor, or certain of
Alkuri’s officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If Alkuri completes a business
combination, Alkuri would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, Alkuri may use a portion of the
221
Table of Contents
working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Alkuri trust account would be used for such
repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The
units would be identical to the private placement warrants.
On May 12, 2021, the Sponsor committed to provide Alkuri with an aggregate of $650,000 in loans. The loans, if issued, will be non-interest bearing,
unsecured and will be repaid upon the consummation of an initial business combination. If Alkuri does not consummate an initial business combination,
all amounts loaned to Alkuri will be forgiven except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the Alkuri trust account to repay such loans.
Excluding the commitment noted above, Alkuri does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for
operating our business. However, if Alkuri’s estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a
business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, Alkuri may have insufficient funds available to operate a business prior to a
business combination. Moreover, Alkuri may need to obtain additional financing either to complete a business combination or because Alkuri becomes
obligated to redeem a significant number of its Alkuri public shares upon consummation of a business combination, in which case Alkuri may issue
additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination.
If the Business Combination is not consummated, Alkuri will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its
Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Alkuri’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan Alkuri funds, from
time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet Alkuri’s working capital needs. Accordingly, Alkuri
may not be able to obtain additional financing. If Alkuri is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve
liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing
overhead expenses. Alkuri cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about Alkuri’s ability to continue as a going concern through one year from the date of these financial statements if a
Business Combination is not consummated. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or
the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should Alkuri be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Alkuri has no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2021. Alkuri did not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities,
which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. Alkuri has not entered into any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial
assets.
Contractual Obligations
Alkuri does not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to
pay an affiliate of one of Alkuri’s executive officers a monthly fee of $20,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Alkuri
began incurring these fees on February 4, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
and its liquidation.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per share, or $12,075,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the
underwriters from the amounts held in the Alkuri trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the
underwriting agreement.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements,” “Selected
Historical Financial Information of Babylon Holdings” and Babylon Holdings Limited’s audited consolidated financial statements, including the
notes thereto, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. Discussion is based on Babylon Holdings Limited’s financial information
prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, which may differ in material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in other
jurisdictions, including U.S. GAAP. Certain statements in this “Babylon’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.
Our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under sections
titled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” “We,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to Babylon
Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and to Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries
(including Alkuri) following the consummation of the Business Combination.
Overview
Babylon Holdings is a leading, global, end-to-end healthcare solution provider utilizing advanced digital-first pathways to deliver meaningfully-
improved healthcare to our customers. Babylon Holdings develops affordable healthcare services accessible to members on digital devices platforms and
providing technology solutions to medical professionals by automating routine tasks for the care of patients. It also uses its technology to step in early
and help members become more informed about medical events, so they can make informed decisions and stay healthier longer. Babylon Holdings
combines artificial intelligence and broader technologies with human expertise to deliver modern healthcare.
We monetize our products and services in three primary ways:
•
Value-Based Care, or VBC, in which we manage a proportion or the entire medical costs of a member population and capture the cost savings.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 32.9% and 51.6%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from
value based care arrangements.
•
Clinical Services, in which our affiliated providers deliver medical consultations, typically on a fee-for-service basis. During the year ended
December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 36.1% and 14.1%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from clinical services.
•
Software Licensing, in which we sell our digital suite of products to partners who provide care through their own medical networks. During the year
ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 31.0% and 34.3%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from software
licensing.
As of July 31, 2021, approximately 24 million members had access to our VBC, clinical and/or software offerings in 16 countries across Europe,
North America, Asia, and Africa. We have scaled our VBC offering rapidly over the last year to become one of the largest VBC networks in the United
States, with over 100,000 VBC members as of July 31, 2021, and we expect to remain focused on U.S. growth. Our company has developed as follows:
•
2013: Founded by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ali Parsadoust.
•
2014: Became the first digital-first health service provider to be registered with the CQC, the healthcare services regulator and inspector in England.
•
2015: Began providing clinical services through our virtual care platform, offering diagnosis, advice and treatments via medical professionals to
patients on a remote basis.
•
2016: First expanded outside the United Kingdom, launching in Rwanda.
225Table of Contents
•
2017: Our technology was made available for licensing to corporate and institutional clients
•
2018: We launched our agreement with Prudential in Asia and since then have been rolling out our symptom checker and health assessment
solutions across 11 countries.
•
2018: We launched our partnership with TELUS in Canada to use our platform to deliver digital health services across Canada.
•
2020: Our first end-to-end digital, integrated VBC service, Babylon 360, was formed. Babylon 360 has since expanded in North America and Europe.
During that time, we have also completed certain investments and acquisitions in recent years that have helped improve our ability to deliver our
products in services:
•
DayToDay. In October 2019, we purchased a majority stake in Health Innovators Inc. (d/b/a DayToDay). This acquisition is intended to bolster
Babylon’s product offering by providing patient management for acute care episodes.
•
Higi. In May 2020, we acquired a minority interest in Higi, as well as an option to acquire the remainder of Higi. We have announced our intention
to exercise this option primarily using our shares as consideration shortly after the completion of the Business Combination. Higi is a maker of
health kiosks found in retail pharmacies and groceries that provide free screenings of blood pressure, weight, pulse and body mass index. This
planned acquisition is intended to increase our reach to users and our ability to provide clinical service offerings to our customers.
•
Fresno Health Care. In October 2020, we acquired certain portions of the Fresno Health Care business of FirstChoice Medical Group (together,
“FCMG”) for $25.7 million. This acquisition is intended to advance the growth of our value-based care services by integrating our digital-first tools
with the ability to provide end-to-end healthcare services in order to create a more accessible and seamless health care experience for our members.
•
Meritage Medical Network. In April 2021, we acquired Meritage Medical Network (“Meritage”) for approximately $31.0 million. This acquisition is
intended to expand the growth of our value-based care services digital-first tools to over 20,000 Medicare Advantage and Commercial HMO
patients within the Meritage network.
We have experienced rapid revenue growth in the past year in particular as we have recently expanded our VBC offerings. Our Revenue was $79.3
million and $16.0 million, our Cost of care delivery was $67.3 million and $19.8 million, our Platform and application expenses were $48.7 million and $16.9
million, our Research and development expenses were $35.5 million and $51.2 million, our Operating loss was $175.5 million and $162.8 million for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Revenue was $128.8 million and $22.5 million, our Cost of care delivery was $92.1 million and $18.8
million, our Platform and application expenses were $21.3 million and $12.9 million, our Research and development expenses were $17.2 million and $20.9
million, and our Operating loss was $78.6 million and $82.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our loss was $188.0
million and $140.3 million, our EBITDA was ($165.0) million and ($143.2) million, and our Adjusted EBITDA was ($146.2) million and ($152.4) million for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Loss was $75.7 million and $90.8 million, our EBITDA was ($62.7) million and ($78.9) million,
and our Adjusted EBITDA was ($54.2) million and ($76.2) million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For a description of how
we calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, and the limitations of these non-IFRS
financial measures, see “—Key Business and Financial Metrics—EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.”
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world (“Pandemic”) has altered the behavior of businesses and people, with significant negative effects
on national, state and local economies, the duration of which remains
226
Table of Contents
unknown at this time. While several of the markets in which we operate are beginning to experience reductions in the effects of the Pandemic, it is not
currently possible to predict the ultimate financial impact COVID-19 will have had on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Key
factors will include the extent to which changes in the behavior of people during the Pandemic result in a permanent change in their behavior, a longer-
term reversion back to pre-pandemic behaviors or a significant immediate change in behaviors as the impacts of the Pandemic become more manageable
because of global vaccination programs.
Merger Agreement
In June 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement by and among Babylon Holdings, Merger Sub, Alkuri and the Sponsors,
which, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving company and wholly owned
subsidiary of Babylon (the “Business Combination”).
Following the consummation of the Business Combination, Babylon Class A Shares will be traded on the NYSE, and we will be required to develop
the functions and resources necessary to operate as a public company, including employee-related costs and equity compensation, which may result in
increased operating expenses.
Key Business and Financial Metrics
We review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics and non-IFRS measures, to evaluate our business,
measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.

Our key business and financial metrics are explained in detail below.
Revenues
Revenue is derived from license fees for the right to access our digital services, clinical service revenue from the provision of clinical services and
capitation revenue from the provision of VBC services.
Software Licensing Revenue. Licensing revenue relates to a user obtaining a right to use and/or access our digital services. In these licensing
arrangements, we provide digital services to corporate entities, and these corporate entities are considered our customer since the contract is for services
that represent our ordinary business.
227
Table of Contents
Clinical Services Revenue. Clinical service revenue is represented by our provision of clinical services to business and private users. Clinical
service fees are based on per member per month (“PMPM”) subscription fees and fees per appointment (“fee for service” or “FFS”). PMPM subscription
fees give members access to our clinical services over the contractual period as set forth in the arrangement and may be allocated to Licensing revenue.
Fee for service is based on contracted rates determined in agreed-upon compensation schedules.
Value-Based Care Revenue. Value-based care revenue consists primarily of per capita fees for the delivery of VBC services under arrangements
with various customers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, we are entitled to monthly PMPM fees to provide a defined range of VBC services to
attributed members. PMPM fees are not dependent upon the volume of specific care services provided.
Part of the consideration received under capitation revenue contracts is variable as the contracts contain provisions for performance-based
incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares where amounts received are dependent upon factors such as quality metrics, member-specific
attributes, and healthcare service costs. Capitation revenue is estimated using the most likely amount methodology and amounts are only included in
revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved. Such
uncertainties may only be resolved several months after the end of the reporting period because of the availability of sufficient reliable data relating to
factors such as quality metrics, member specific attributes and healthcare service costs. Subsequent changes in capitation fees and the amount of
capitation revenue to be recognized by us are reflected in subsequent periods. The amount of variable capitation revenue recognized is expected to
increase as the number of members we provide VBC services to increases.
Expenses are classified by relevant function:
In 2020, following the start of the VBC revenue stream, management reviewed the presentation of the consolidated statement of profit and loss and
considered whether it continues to provide relevant and reliable information to stakeholders. It was concluded that there should be an update to how
certain expenses were classified and therefore the Group has changed its accounting policy for expense classifications. Previously, the Group had
disclosed Depreciation and Amortization as a separate expense category, whereas now Depreciation and Amortization costs are allocated to their relevant
function. In addition, the Group elected to separately present costs of revenue relating to its Platform and application expenses, including the
amortization and impairment, and Research and development expenses, excluding the amortization and impairment, in its Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss. The elective disaggregated presentation of amounts previously classified as Research & development and technology expenses was applied
retrospectively to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cost of Care Delivery
Our cost of care delivery primarily consists of fees paid to the physicians and other health professionals in our provider network and costs incurred
in connection with our provider network operations. Cost of care delivery is mainly driven by patient activity and required medical services and are
relatively variable. Costs incurred relating to the delivery of VBC services is recorded as an expense within cost of care delivery when capitation revenue
is recognized.
Platform & Application Expenses
Platform and application expenses are costs of revenue related to our digital healthcare platform. These costs primarily include employee-related
salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and consultant expenses, for individuals that are engaged in providing professional
services related to support and maintenance of the digital healthcare platform, as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other direct
costs. It also includes amortization of capitalized development activities, including related amortization of tax credits.
Research & Development Expenses
Research and development expenses primarily included employee-related salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and
consultant expenses for individuals that are engaged in performing
228
Table of Contents
activities to develop and enhance the Group’s digital healthcare platform as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other indirect
costs. Research costs and development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
Sales, General & Administrative Expenses
Sales, general & administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, contractors and consultants’ expense, stock-based compensation,
property and facility related expenses, IT and hosting, marketing, training and recruiting expenses. Enterprise IT and hosting costs are primarily software
subscriptions, domain and hosting costs. Our Sales, general & administrative expenses also include depreciation of property, fixtures and fittings and
amortization of acquired intangible assets.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
In addition to our financial results reported in accordance with IFRS, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-IFRS
financial measures, are useful in evaluating the performance of our business. We define EBITDA as profit (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization,
net finance income (costs), and income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization, net finance income
(costs), income taxes, share-based compensation, impairment expenses, foreign exchange gains or losses and gains (losses) on sale of subsidiaries.
We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful metrics for investors to understand and evaluate our operating results and ongoing
profitability because it permits investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from our ongoing operating activities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
have certain limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS.
We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar
measures disclosed by other issuers, because some issuers calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, limiting their usefulness as
direct comparative measures.
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA from the most comparable IFRS measure, loss for the financial year,
for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Users
Users is the total number of members who have joined our digital platform and completed all mandatory fields on the digital platform. Once a
member is registered, Babylon has been able to capture member details and provides the member with access to Babylon’s suite of digital services.
Growth in users in the six months ended June 30, 2021 was driven primarily by engagement from our VBC members and increases in the number of
members receiving clinical services.

Members
Members are the number of members for which we provide Clinical Services or Value-Based Care Services.
VBC Members
VBC Members are the number of members for which full cost risk of covered services is assumed under Value-Based Care arrangements.
Key Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Revenue is derived from license fees for the right to access our digital services, clinical service revenue from the provision of clinical services and
capitation revenue from the provision of value-based care services.
Software Licensing Revenue. The majority of revenue related to software licensing is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term
beginning when the customer has access to the service. Revenue from software licensing arrangements with multiple performance obligations that is not
recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized when the performance obligations have been satisfied upon transfer of the service, typically a right to
use the service, to the customer. Any revenue relating to localization of services prior to the commencement of license term is not deemed to be distinct
from the license contract and is subsequently also recognized over the license term. Efforts to satisfy performance obligations are expended evenly
throughout the performance period and so the performance obligation is satisfied evenly over time.
Clinical Services Revenue. Clinical service fees are based on PMPM (per member per month) subscription fees and fees per appointment. PMPM
subscription fees are recognized monthly based on the number of members covered by the plan in a given month and may be allocated to Licensing
Revenue. Fee for service is recognized when the services are rendered at a point in time.
Value-Based Care Revenue. Unlike clinical services revenue, we accept full financial risk for members attributed to our VBC services, which means
we are responsible for the cost of all covered services required by members.
Cost of Care Delivery
Our cost of care delivery primarily consists of fees paid to the physicians and other health professionals in our provider network and costs incurred
in connection with our provider network operations. Cost of care delivery is mainly driven by patient activity and required medical services and are
relatively variable. Costs incurred relating to the delivery of VBC services is recorded as an expense within cost of care delivery when value-based care
revenue is recognized.
Platform and application expenses
Platform and application expenses are costs of revenue related to our digital healthcare platform. These costs primarily include employee-related
salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and consultant expenses, for individuals that are engaged in providing professional
services related to support and maintenance of the digital healthcare platform, as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other direct
costs. The amortization of capitalized development costs are also included in Platform and application expenses. We expect our Platform and application
expenses to increase commensurate with increased maintenance attributable to new contracts and continuing development of our Babylon technology
platform.
Research & development expenses
Research and development expenses primarily included employee-related salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and
consultant expenses, for individuals that are engaged in performing
230
Table of Contents
activities to develop and enhance the Group’s digital healthcare platform as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other indirect
costs. Research costs and development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. We expect our Research &
development expenses to continue to increase commensurate with the continued development of our Babylon technology platform.
Sales, General & Administrative Expenses
Sales, general & administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, contractors and consultants’ expense, stock-based compensation,
property and facility related expenses, IT and hosting, marketing, training and recruiting expenses. Enterprise IT and hosting costs are primarily software
subscriptions, domain and hosting costs. Our Sales, general & administrative expenses also include depreciation of property, fixtures and fittings and
amortization of acquired intangible assets. We expect our Sales, general & administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to costs that
we incur as a new public company, as well as other costs associated with continuing to grow our business. However, we expect our Sales, general &
administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over the next several years. Our Sales, general & administrative expenses may
fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the number of consultations and number of assigned Babylon members of our
total revenue and the timing and extent of our Sales, general & administrative expenses.

Total revenues increased to $128.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $22.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020,
largely due to the expansion of the value-based care revenue stream in the United States, including revenue recognized following the acquisition of
Meritage. In addition, software licensing revenue increased as a result of a new seven-year licensing contract executed in January 2021, licensing our
white-labeled digital platform to TELUS Health, a healthcare provider.
Total Software licensing fee revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $33.9 million from the same period in the prior year. The
increase of $33.9 million is primarily due to the new licensing contract discussed in the previous paragraph of $26.6 million.
Total Clinical services revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $6.0 million from the same period in the prior year driven by a
$4.0 million increase in revenue from an existing fee for service customer.
Value-based care revenue commenced in October 2020 following the launch of the Babylon 360 product in the United States. Value-based care
revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 included $15.3 million

Total revenues increased to $79.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
largely due to the expansion of the provision of licensing services into new regions, particularly as we expanded into Asia, growth in our clinician
services and the commencement of the provision of value-based care services.
Total licensing revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 by $22.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. $12.7
million of the increase was due to the launch of our digital services in seven Asian countries during 2020. In addition to geographic expansion, we also
licensed the COVID-19 care assistant within the United Kingdom. In addition, licensing revenue increased by $4.1 million related to the COVID-19
symptom checker that was utilized across NHS trusts in Birmingham and Wolverhampton that was not deployed in 2019. While we expect these revenues
related to the COVID-19 care assistant to decrease in 2021, we believe revenues from new and existing contracts to other healthcare services provided
across NHS trusts will at least partially offset this decline. It is not currently possible to quantify the direct impact of COVID-19 on our revenues and
expenses. We expect the demand for digital services to continue to grow even after the COVID-19 pandemic abates. Finally, $4.9 million of the increase
came from an increase in new users in the United States.
Total clinical services revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 by $14.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. $1.2
million of the increase was due to the launch of our FFS offerings in various locations in the United States providing both general medicine and
behavioral health virtual appointments. $3.8 million of the increase was due to U.K. market organic membership growth in the Babylon GP at Hand
population. In addition, an increase in private appointments contributed an additional $6.6 million in 2020 versus 2019. The remaining growth was
contributed by Canada and Rwanda services that continued to grow driven by demand for appointments.
Value based care revenue commenced in 2020 following the launch of the Babylon 360 product in October 2020 in the United States.
Variable revenue recognized from performance-based incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares was not material in 2020. We review our
VBC capitation revenue contracts to assess whether any of them should be considered onerous contracts by applying the industry based guidance on
premium deficiency reserves. None of our contracts were determined to be onerous contracts as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.

Cost of care delivery increased by $47.4 million from $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $67.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 primarily from an increase in physicians and other health professionals as a result of increased demand for clinical services and the launch of
value-based care. Cost of care delivery in the United States increased by $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year
236
Table of Contents
ended December 31, 2019. This was the result of launching a 24-hour virtual clinical service and the secondary and tertiary care for value-based care
patients. Costs also increased by $5.1 million following greater demand for private appointments in the United Kingdom and growth in Babylon GP at
Hand membership, resulting in increased costs relating to physicians and other health professionals. In Canada, patient demand for appointments grew,
physicians’ costs resulted in $4.1 million higher costs in 2020 than 2019. The other drivers of cost of care delivery were the cost of support and
management role, which increased by $9.3 million and were necessary in the expansion of services in the United States and greater breadth of care across
different clinician types in the United Kingdom. During the year ended December 31, 2020, claims expense included in Cost of care delivery was $11.9
million, of which $7.6 million had been paid as of December 31, 2020. There was no claims expense activity in 2019.

the year ended December 31, 2020, which was a $15.3 million increase for the equivalent costs during the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to a reallocation of resources between Research and development and Platform & application activities within our technology
operations during 2020. Depreciation and amortization included in Platform & application expenses was $11.1 million in 2020, a $9.9 million increase when
compared to 2019. In addition, following an assessment of the future development of our technology, capitalized development costs were impaired by $6.4
million in 2020. This impairment was primarily the result of the discontinuation of certain features in 2020 surrounding a proprietary data structure for
encounters on our software platform that were deemed to be no longer technologically feasible.

development and Platform & application activities within our technology operations during 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, development
costs of approximately $43,027 were capitalized. The development costs that were capitalized during the year were those direct costs related to our
development and technology operations that were deemed technologically feasible and probable of generating future economic benefits. This decrease
was partly offset by an increase in share based-compensation expense of $5.2 million when compared to 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of funds has been proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt and equity. We secured funding of $380 million in
August 2019 from existing and new investors through a Series C investment round. In November 2020, we executed a $200 million Convertible Loan Note
agreement, where $30 million Tranche 1 Notes were issued. In December 2020, an additional $70 million of Tranche 2 Notes were issued in accordance with
the Convertible Loan Note agreement and the Tranche 1 Notes were converted into Babylon Holdings’ Series C Shares, with $100 million of notes
available under the Convertible Loan Note agreement. Additional information related to the Convertible Loan Note agreement is disclosed in Note 19 of
the Babylon Holdings audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we had a loss for the period of $75.7 million and $90.8, respectively. For the year ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, we had a net loss of $188.0 million and $140.3 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we
had cash and cash equivalents of $42.4 million, $101.8 million and $214.9 million, respectively. We require and will continue to need significant cash
resources to, among other things, fund our working capital requirements,
238
Table of Contents
increase our headcount, make capital expenditures (including those related to product development), and expand our business through acquisitions. Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the cost of future acquisitions, our ability to provide more affordable healthcare, the
scale of our increases in headcount, and the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts. Based upon our forecasts through
the period ending December 31, 2022, we are expecting to consummate the Business Combination and believe that the capital raised will be sufficient to
provide adequate funding to service our obligations, meet liquidity needs and fund necessary capital expenditures through this forecast period. In the
event that we are unable to consummate the Business Combination we believe that we will be required to seek additional funding through public or
private equity or debt financings to continue our operations. While there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be consummated or, in the
event that the Business Combination is not consummated, that additional funds are available to us on acceptable terms, we believe that we will be
successful in raising the additional capital we need to be able to meet our liabilities as they fall due over the period ending December 31, 2022.
As of June 30, 2021, Babylon Holdings’ cash and cash equivalents totaled $42.4 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming consummation of the
Business Combination on or before December 3, 2021, the transaction is expected to deliver up to $575 million in gross proceeds, including $345 million in
gross proceeds from cash held in Alkuri’s trust account, assuming no redemptions. In addition, the Business Combination is further supported by a $230
million PIPE Investment. In addition, and as discussed above in the “—Overview” section, Babylon Holdings previously acquired an option to purchase
Higi, a consumer health engagement company, and intends to acquire the remaining equity it does not already own, which will reduce Babylon Holdings’
cash needs by approximately $40 million. Assuming no redemptions, and taking transaction costs and strategic investments into account, Babylon is
expected to have approximately $540 million in cash and cash equivalents assuming no redemptions by Alkuri Stockholders, which amount will be
dependent on the extent of redemptions by Alkuri as of the Closing, and other factors.
Babylon Holdings had originally anticipated agreement on the Business Combination several months earlier than it was originally agreed due to
market conditions. As such, it has subsequently obtained bridge financing to address short-term cash flow needs pending consummation of the
Business Combination. Accordingly, on July 15, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a loan agreement with VNV Group for $15.0 million. The interest rate
on the loan is 14%.
On August 18, 2021, Babylon Holdings issued $50.0 million in unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (“Unsecured Bonds”), including the non-
cash conversion of $8.0 million in borrowings under the loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The
interest rate on the loan is 10%, with interest payable quarterly. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds can be used for general corporate purposes.
The Company utilized proceeds of $7.2 million from the Unsecured Bonds to settle the remainder of the loan and interest with VNV (Cyprus) Limited. Cash
proceeds from the bond issuance, net of discounts, repayments of borrowings, and transaction expenses total approximately $32.1 million. The
Unsecured Bonds have a one-year term and they can be redeemed by Babylon Holdings at any time. Payment of the bonds is mandatory upon
completion of a business combination or change in control. Babylon Holdings must maintain a minimum cash balance of $10.0 million to comply with
financial covenants.
Babylon is considering market conditions including the possibility of requests for redemptions by Alkuri stockholders in connection with the
Business Combination. Babylon has engaged Ardea and Citi to explore potential additional sources of funding to supplement the combined Company’s
cash balance following the Closing. Babylon is evaluating obtaining debt financing with a principal ranging between $100 million and $200 million to be
entered into concurrently with or shortly after the Closing on customary terms, which may include security interests, restrictive covenants and/or
warrants for the purchase of shares of Babylon. Further, depending on the timing of the Closing, Babylon may seek to negotiate a modification of the
terms of the Unsecured Bonds in order to issue additional Unsecured Bonds, to increase Babylon’s borrowing capacity by up to $25m. See “Risk Factors
—Risks Related to Babylon’s Business and Operations Following the Business Combination—We may require additional capital to support business
growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.”

Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $19.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash used in operating activities of
$87.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of approximately $67.9 million. The Loss for the period after adjusting for non-cash items
decreased by $23.1 million, from $75.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $52.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This decrease
was increased by the net effect of changes in working capital of $44.9 million.
Net cash used in operating activities was $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used in operating activities of
$143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million. Net loss for the financial year, after adjusting for non-cash
items, decreased by $7.3 million, from $152.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This
decrease was largely offset by the unfavorable net effect of changes in working capital of $7.1 million.
Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $35.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash used in investing activities of
$23.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of $5.0 million investment in
Higi and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $14.0 million relating to an acquisition consummated in April 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities was $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of
$36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of the $10.0 million investment
in Higi and cash paid for acquisitions of $25.7 million relating to the acquisition of FCMG.
Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $4.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash provided by financing activities
of $13.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in Net cash provided by financing activities of $8.5 million is primarily the result of
fees paid directly attributable to the equity raise in the six months ended June 30, 2020 of $10.2 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
240
Table of Contents
The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities of $242.4 million is primarily the result of higher gross proceeds from the issuance of share
capital of $308.2 million during 2019, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of convertible loan notes in 2020 of $48.9 million, as well as the
repayment of convertible loans of $14.8 million in 2019, whereas Babylon Holdings did not have any repayments on borrowings during 2020.
Funding Requirements
Babylon Holdings’ directors performed a going concern assessment for a period of twelve months from the date of approval of these financial
statements. This assessment indicates that additional funding, which the directors expect to obtain through the consummation of the Business
Combination, is required to provide sufficient funds to meet our liabilities as they fall due for that period. As of December 31, 2020 the Group had a net
asset position of $48.4 million (as of December 31, 2019: $173.8 million), including cash and cash equivalents of $101.8 million (as of December 31, 2019:
$214.9 million). For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had a net asset position of $58.0 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.4 million.
While there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be consummated or, in the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, that
additional funds are available to us on acceptable terms, we believe that we will be successful in raising the additional capital we need to meet our
working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this report. Based on this, we believe it
remains appropriate to prepare our financial statements on a going concern basis.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
In the normal course of business, we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments. The commitments result
primarily from operating leases. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2021:

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships,
such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-
balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to the financing, liquidity, market or credit
risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our financial statements
because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, which could have a material impact on our financial
statements if actual performance should differ from historical experience or if our assumptions were to change. The following accounting policies include
estimates that require management’s subjective or complex judgments about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. For information on our
significant accounting policies, including the policies discussed below, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this proxy statement/prospectus.
241
Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition
Certain of the Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. The Group assesses the services
promised in a contract and identifies distinct or bundled performance obligations in the contract. Identification of these performance obligations involves
judgement to determine the promises and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such promises. If multiple performance obligations are
identified in the contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the
Group recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. Significant judgment is required to determine the
stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and the determination may not always be discernible from past transactions or other
observable evidence. We utilize several inputs when determining stand-alone selling price, including the price of services sold on a standalone basis, our
overall pricing strategies, the cost of providing the service, market data and the geographic locations in which the service is provided.
For revenue related to value based care arrangements, Babylon Holdings has determined that a portion of the transaction price under capitation
revenue contracts is variable as the contracts contain provisions for performance-based incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares where
amounts received are dependent upon factors such as quality metrics, member-specific attributes, and healthcare service costs. The variable portion of
capitation revenue is estimated using the most likely amount methodology and amounts are only included in revenue to the extent that it is highly
probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved. Capitation revenue is recognized gross when it
is assessed that the performance obligation relates to the whole of the patient journey with Babylon Holdings responsible for arranging, providing and
controlling the VBC services provided to the attributed members, with expenses payable to other healthcare providers recorded in cost of care delivery.
This is a significant judgment when assessing the performance obligation.
Capitalization of Development Costs
We capitalize expenditures for the development of technology to the extent that it is expected to meet the criteria in accordance with IAS 38,
Intangible Assets (“IAS 38”). The decision to capitalize is based on significant judgments made by management, including the technical feasibility of
completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale and assumptions used to demonstrate that the asset will generate probable
future economic benefits (e.g., projected cash flow projections, discount rate). Development costs of $43.0 million (2019: $36.0 million) were capitalized in
the year based on a model whereby a percentage is allocated to employee related expenses based on the time spent on the development of assets. All
employee expenses included in this balance relate to employees in the technology departments, and the percentage attributable varies depending on the
nature of the work performed and the type of asset being developed.
Impairment of Intangible Assets
The carrying values of our long-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. If any indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Determining the
recoverable amount is subjective and requires management to estimate future growth, profitability, discount and terminal growth rates, and project future
cash flows, among other factors. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may
result in changes to our estimates of future cash flows.
If we conclude that a definite or indefinite long-lived intangible asset is impaired, we recognize a loss in an amount equal to the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over its fair value at the date of impairment. The fair value at the date of the impairment becomes the new cost basis and will
result in a lower depreciation expense than for periods before the asset’s impairment.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) has control. The Group controls an entity when
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its
242
Table of Contents
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. To determine whether the
Group controls an entity, status of voting or similar rights, contractual arrangements and other specific factors are considered. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on which that control ceases.
We hold certain rights in the form of purchase options to acquire additional equity interests in entities that we have an existing shareholding in.
These rights are assessed as either substantive or protective in nature to conclude whether we exercise control over the entity. This assessment requires
judgment relating to both the barriers that may prevent, and the extent to which we would benefit from, exercise of those rights and determines whether
we should consolidate the entity.
In addition, we consolidate certain professional service corporations (“PCs”) which are owned, directly or indirectly, and operated by appropriately
licensed physicians. We maintain control of these PCs through contractual arrangements, which can include service agreements, financing agreements,
equity transfer restriction agreements, and employment agreements, or a combination thereof, which are primarily established during the formation of the
PCs. At inception, the contractual framework established between the Group and the PCs provides the Group with the power to direct the relevant
activities in the conduct of the PC’s non-clinical administrative and other non-clinical business activities. The physicians employed by the PC are
exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for their patients. Babylon Healthcare NJ, PC, Babylon Healthcare,
PLLC, Marcus Zachary, DO, OC, California Telemedicine Associates, PC, Babylon Healthcare, PC, and Babylon Healthcare NC, PC employ healthcare
providers to deliver primary care services to VBC members and users of the digital platform. These PCs are consolidated on the basis of control through
contractual arrangements.

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position
due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs
were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could
harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Credit risk
Our cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and loans with banks and financial institutions are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. We
place cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that
243
Table of Contents
management believes are of high credit quality. We seek to limit our credit risk with respect to customers by implementing due diligence procedures on all
customers. We manage credit risk through receiving cash payment for large contracts up front in some instances, in addition to contracting with
government funded entities which subsequently carries lower risks.
Currency risk
While our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we operate internationally and are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, specifically British
Pound Sterling. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in
exchange rates. We manage our currency risk through natural hedges (offsetting of receivables and payables) in addition to implementing investment
procedures. Several of our consolidated entities operate in foreign countries and therefore, their net assets are exposed to the risk associated with
translating foreign currencies.
Interest rate risk
As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $42.4 million and $101.8 million, respectively, which
consisted primarily of money market accounts, which carries a degree of interest rate risk. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.
Implications of being an “Emerging Growth Company” and a “Foreign Private Issuer”
Each of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings is, and consequently, following the Business Combination, Babylon will be, an “emerging growth company,”
as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, Babylon will
be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not
“emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in their periodic reports and
proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find Babylon’s securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active
trading market for Babylon’s securities and the prices of Babylon’s securities may be more volatile.
Babylon will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the
closing of the Alkuri IPO, (b) in which Babylon has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which Babylon is deemed to be a large
accelerated filer, which means the market value of Babylon’s common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day
of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter; and (ii) the date on which Babylon has issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt
securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Babylon Holdings is also considered a “foreign private issuer” and will report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with “foreign private
issuer” status. This means that, even after Babylon Holdings no longer qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” as long as it qualifies as a “foreign
private issuer” under the Exchange Act, it will be exempt from certain provisions of and intends to take advantage certain exemptions from the Exchange
Act that are applicable to U.S. public companies, including:
•
the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under
the Exchange Act;
•
the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for
insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and
244
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until such time as it is no longer a “foreign private issuer.” Babylon Holdings
could lose its status as a “foreign private issuer” under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of Babylon Holdings’ outstanding voting
securities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of the Babylon Holding’s
directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents; (ii) more than 50% of Babylon Holdings’ assets are located in the United States; or (iii)
Babylon Holdings’ business is administered principally in the United States.
Babylon Holdings’ may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. Babylon Holdings has taken advantage of reduced
reporting requirements in this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus may be different
from the information you receive from Babylon Holdings’ competitors that are public companies, or other public companies in which you have made an
investment. We expect to lose our foreign private issuer status for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of increased contacts with the United
States.

Defined terms included below shall have the same meaning as terms defined and included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Introduction
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information presents the pro forma effects of the following transactions:
•
the Business Combination; and
•
the Higi acquisition. As described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Babylon Holdings has an option to acquire Higi. See “—
Description of the Business Combination.”
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of financial position as of June 30, 2021 (“Pro Forma Statement of Financial Position”)
give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they were consummated on June 30, 2021. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive loss (“Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss”) for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and six months ended June 30, 2021 give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they had occurred
on January 1, 2020. The pro forma statements of financial position do not purport to represent, and are not necessarily indicative of, what the actual
financial condition of Babylon would have been had the Business Combination and Higi acquisition taken place on June 30, 2021, as applicable, nor are
they indicative of the financial condition of Babylon as of any future date. The pro forma statements of profit and loss do not purport to represent, and
are not necessarily indicative of, what the actual results of operations of Babylon would have been had the Business Combination and Higi acquisition
taken place on January 1, 2020, as applicable, nor are they indicative of the results of operations of Babylon for any future period. The unaudited pro
forma adjustments represent management’s estimates based on information available as of the date of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and analyses are performed.
This information should be read together with the audited and unaudited historical financial statements of each of Alkuri, Babylon Holdings and
Higi, including the notes thereto, as well as the disclosures contained in the sections titled “Babylon’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Alkuri’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
and other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the following
historical financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus:
•
Babylon Holdings’ historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021;
•
Babylon Holdings’ historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020;
•
Higi’s historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021;
•
Higi’s historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020;
•
Alkuri’s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021; and
246Table of Contents
•
Alkuri’s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. As a newly incorporated
business on December 1, 2020, the results of Alkuri prior to January 1, 2021 were not material.
The historical consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in its presentation currency of
USD. The historical financial statements of Alkuri and Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of USD. In the
case of Alkuri and Higi, adjustments were made to conform the U.S. GAAP financial statements to IFRS. Accordingly, pro forma adjustments have been
reflected to conform the basis of accounting and accounting policies for Alkuri and Higi to those of Babylon Holdings. The historical consolidated
financial statements of Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of USD and have been adjusted to give effect
to material differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
Description of the Business Combination
Babylon Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement, dated June 3, 2021, by and among Babylon Holdings, Merger Sub, Alkuri and the Sponsor,
which, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving company and wholly owned
subsidiary of Babylon (the “Business Combination”). For more information about the Business Combination, please see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement.”
On May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a network
of Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series of investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on a fully diluted
basis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option to continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all proposed
investments, it will hold over 25% of Higi’s shareholdings on a fully diluted basis.
On June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three largest
shareholders in Higi. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon’s option to purchase the remaining
shares of Higi will be exercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon would provide
registration rights to such shareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley agreed to
be paid in shares of Babylon Holdings in lieu of cash.
The contemplated consideration for the Higi acquisition is $70.3 million. Accordingly, the parties expect to issue up to 6.4 million shares of Babylon
Holdings as the consideration in the transaction, with each share of Babylon Holdings to be valued at $10 per share although shareholders other than
7Wire, Flare and Wrigley may elect to accept cash in lieu of shares. Because of the agreement reached in the Letter Agreement, Babylon Holdings will
issue at least 3.9 million shares of Babylon Holdings as the consideration in the transaction. In connection with the Higi acquisition, certain continuing
employees, as determined by Babylon, will receive restricted stock units granted in respect of Babylon Class A Shares (“Babylon RSUs”), valued at $10.
Babylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon Holdings. As such, the historical
financial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma Statement of Financial Position assumes
that the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred on
January 1, 2020.
Accounting for the Business Combination
The Business Combination with Alkuri will be accounted for as a merger in accordance with IFRS. Under this method of accounting, Alkuri will be
treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes.
247
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings has accounted for its acquisition of Alkuri as a Business Combination because Babylon is considered the accounting acquirer. This
determination was primarily based on the assumptions that Babylon Holdings’ shareholders will hold a majority of the voting power of Babylon, Babylon
Holdings’ operations will substantially comprise the ongoing operations of Babylon, Babylon Holdings’ designees are expected to comprise a majority of
the governing body of Babylon, and Babylon Holdings’ senior management will comprise the senior management of Babylon. Because Alkuri does not
meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”) (“IFRS 3”), and the net assets of Alkuri primarily comprise
cash and cash equivalents, the Business Combination is accounted for as a Business Combination whereby the net assets of Alkuri will be stated at
historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. However, any excess of the share consideration issued by Babylon over the fair
value of Alkuri’s identifiable net assets acquired represents compensation for the service of a share exchange listing for its shares and is expensed as
incurred in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payment (“IFRS 2”). Accordingly, the excess of the fair value of the share consideration in excess of the
net book value of the assets of Alkuri has been reflected as a recapitalization transaction expense in the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss.
Operations prior to the Business Combination will be deemed to be those of Babylon Holdings.
Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to provide an
understanding of Babylon upon consummation of the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X
as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.” Release No. 33-
10786 replaces the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for the transaction (“Transaction
Accounting Adjustments”) and present the reasonably estimable synergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected
to occur (“Management’s Adjustments”). Babylon Holdings has elected not to present Management’s Adjustments and will only be presenting
Transaction Accounting Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different
had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information as being indicative
of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that Babylon will achieve. Babylon
and Alkuri have not had any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were required to eliminate
activities between the companies.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared assuming two alternative levels of redemption into cash of
Alkuri Common Stock:
•
Scenario 1 – Assuming no redemptions for cash: This presentation assumes that no Alkuri Stockholders exercise redemption rights with
respect to their shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon consummation of the Business Combination; and
•
Scenario 2 – Assuming redemptions of 34,500,000 of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash: This presentation assumes that Alkuri
Stockholders exercise their redemption rights with respect to a maximum of 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon
consummation of the Business Combination at a redemption price of approximately $10.00 per share. The maximum redemption amount
reflects the redemption of all outstanding Alkuri Class A Common Stock given the minimum requirements in the Merger Agreement of $230
million of cash held either in or outside of the trust account, including the aggregate amount of any proceeds from the PIPE Investment,
after giving effect to the payments to redeeming Alkuri Stockholders. Scenario 2 includes all adjustments contained in Scenario 1 and
presents additional adjustments to reflect the effect of maximum redemptions.
After the Closing, assuming no redemptions of shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash, Alkuri Stockholders and the Sponsor will own
9.8% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Shares and 1,300,000 shares from the PIPE Investment), the PIPE Investors will own
approximately 5.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including shares purchased by the Founder, Sponsor and certain existing Babylon Holdings
shareholders in the PIPE Investment) and the existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will own approximately 85.0% of the outstanding Babylon
Shares. Additionally, the capitalization table includes Earnout Class A Shares issued to the Sponsor of 0.3% and Earnout Class B Shares issued to the
Founder of 8.8%. Assuming redemption by holders of all 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock, the Sponsor will own approximately 1.8% of
the outstanding Babylon Shares, the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.7% of outstanding Babylon Shares and the existing shareholders of
Babylon Holdings will own approximately 92.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (in each case, not giving effect to any shares purchased by the
Founder, the Sponsor and existing Babylon Holdings shareholders in the PIPE Investment and any shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of
warrants or options outstanding). The Sponsor will own an additional 0.3% of the outstanding Babylon shares and the Founder will own an additional
9.5% of the outstanding Babylon shares as a result of the Earnout Class A and B Shares issued and outstanding.
The foregoing does not reflect the effect of the exercise of the 5,933,333 private placement warrants held by the Sponsor or the 8,625,000 public
warrants. Assuming all of the private placement warrants and public warrants are exercised and the earnout milestones are met such that the Earnout
Shares are not subject to the repurchase right, (i) there would be a total of 441,352,107 shares of Babylon Holdings outstanding (assuming no

Babylon’s statement of financial position was derived from the unaudited consolidated statement of financial position as of June 30, 2021 prepared
in accordance with IFRS. Higi’s statement of financial position was extracted from the unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2021. The Higi
statement of financial position was prepared in accordance of U.S. GAAP. The Alkuri statement of financial position was extracted from the unaudited
condensed balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
(A)
To reflect the proceeds received from the PIPE Investment with the corresponding issuance of 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares at
approximately US$10.00 per share, or $230 million.
(B)
To reflect the release of cash from marketable securities held in the trust account.
(C)
To reflect the elimination of historical accumulated deficit in Alkuri as it is the accounting acquiree.
(D)
To reflect the settlement of Alkuri’s historical current liabilities at Closing.
(E)
To reflect the reclassification of Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption of approximately $303 million from temporary
equity under U.S. GAAP to a liability under IFRS, because the right to redeem is at the option of the holder. The additional adjustment is
related to the reclassification of approximately $303 million of Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption to permanent
equity.

Table of Contents
(F)
The fair value of share consideration of $414 million and Alkuri’s net assets of $308 million result in an excess of the fair value of the shares
issued over the value of the net monetary assets acquired of $105 million. Assuming no redemptions, this was reflected as a transaction
expense of $106 million for the services provided by Alkuri in connection with the listing. The fair value calculation of $414 million is based
on the combined company estimated fair value derived from Babylon’s enterprise valuation of $3.6 billion and the level of ownership that
existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will have in Babylon of approximately 85%, after taking into account the Stockholder Earnout
and Sponsor Earnout. The net assets were derived from Alkuri’s historical condensed consolidated financial statements.

Assuming maximum redemptions, the ownership in the combined company changes to 92% resulting in a reduction to the enterprise fair value.
Alkuri’s ownership percentage of 2% results in the fair value of the share consideration of $83 million. Similarly, there is a reduction in the net assets by
$317 million based on the redemptions, which results in a fair value excess of $119 million. The $14 million adjustment is to reflect this excess.

(G)
To reflect the Business Combination of Babylon through the issuance of 280,000,000 of Babylon Class A Shares as consideration for the
Business Combination assuming no redemptions.
(H)
To reflect the payment of an aggregate of $68.5 million of estimated legal, financial advisory and other professional fees that are directly
attributable to the equity issuance costs as part of the Business Combination, which is reflected as an adjustment to additional paid in
capital. These expenses were not previously accounted for in the financial statements as of the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and
as of June 30, 2021.
(I)
Reflects the maximum redemption of all 34,500,000 Alkuri Class A Common Stock for aggregate redemption payments of approximately $345
million allocated to Babylon Class A Shares. The additional capital is based on using a par value $0.0001 per share and at a redemption price
of approximately $10.00 per share.

The Babylon Holdings’ statement of profit and loss was derived from the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive loss of
Babylon Holdings for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The Higi statement of profit or loss was derived
from the unaudited consolidated statement of operations of Higi for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Alkuri’s statement of operations was derived
from the historical condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021. As a newly incorporated business on
December 1, 2020, the results of Alkuri prior to January 1, 2021 were not material.
Pro Forma Adjustments:
(J)
As discussed in (F) the listing expense charge to recapitalization transaction expenses is $105 million assuming no redemptions for the year
ended December 31, 2020. Under a maximum redemption scenario, the adjustment of $14 million reflects the expense of $119 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020.
(K)
Reflects the elimination of interest income on Alkuri’s Trust Account.
(L)
Reflects the adjustment related to the bridge financing obtained by Babylon. On August 18, 2021, the Group issued $50.0 million in
unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (“Unsecured Bonds”), including the non-cash conversion of $8.0 million in borrowings under the
loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds can be
used for general corporate purposes. For purposes of the pro forma statements, the Unsecured Bonds are shown to be repaid in full once
the transaction closes. Therefore, the capitalized costs associated with the financing have been expensed during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020.

The historical information should be read in conjunction with the information in the sections entitled “Selected Historical Financial Data of
Alkuri” and “Selected Historical Financial Information of Babylon Holdings” and the historical financial statements of Alkuri, Babylon Holdings and
Higi included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The Babylon Holdings pro forma equivalent per share financial information is calculated by multiplying the combined unaudited pro forma per
share amounts by the exchange ratio, whereby each share of Babylon Holdings ordinary shares are converted into Babylon Shares at a conversion ratio
of approximately 0.3, and each share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into one Babylon Class A Share.

1.)
The classification of certain items presented by Higi under U.S. GAAP has been adjusted in order to align with the presentation of Babylon under
IFRS.
260
Table of Contents
Modification to Higi’s historical consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 include:
•
Presentation of Depreciation of Higi stations ($0.1 million) and Other cost of revenue ($6.7 million) in Research and development expenses
($6.8 million).
•
Separate presentation of components of Operating expenses ($12.5 million) to Research and development expenses ($8.8 million) and Sales,

costs ($6.3 million).
•
Presentation of Gain on extinguishment of debt ($3.0 million) to Finance income ($3.0 million).
•
Presentation of Other expenses ($0.2 million) in Sales, general & administrative expenses ($0.2 million).

•
Presentation of Other cost of revenue ($3.6 million) in Research and development expenses ($3.6 million).
•
Separate presentation of components of Operating expenses ($7.0 million) to Research and development expenses ($5.1 million) and Sales,
general and administrative expenses ($1.9 million).

2.)
Higi has not adopted ASC 842, Leases, which becomes effective for private companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. In
accordance with IFRS 16, Leases¸ and Babylon’s accounting policies, right of use assets of $1.2 million and lease liabilities of $1.8 million have been
recognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2021. In addition, accrued rent liabilities of $0.3 million have been derecognized from the balance
sheet as of June 30, 2021. The impact of the adjustments to the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.
3.)
Under U.S. GAAP, Higi elected to apply the straight-line approach for graded vesting when measuring share- based payment awards. Under IFRS,
Babylon would use the graded vesting method, resulting in a higher proportion of cost being allocated to the earlier years. The impact of the
adjustments on the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.
Note 2. Preliminary Allocation of Purchase Price
On May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a network
of Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series of investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on a fully diluted
basis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option to continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all proposed
investments, it will hold over 25% of Higi’s shareholdings on a fully diluted basis.
261
Table of Contents
On June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into the Letter Agreement with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three largest shareholders in Higi.
Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon’s option to purchase the remaining shares of Higi will be
exercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon would provide registration rights to such
shareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley agreed to be paid in shares of
Babylon Holdings in lieu of cash.
Babylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon Holdings. As such, the
historical financial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma Statement of Financial Position
assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss assumes that the Higi acquisition
occurred on January 1, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, the total shareholding was 19.0% and 25%, respectively.
The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS and
assuming Babylon Holdings closed the Higi acquisition by purchasing the remaining 75% for estimated consideration with a fair value of approximately
$70.3 million. The Higi acquisition was achieved in stages, which required Babylon Holdings to remeasure its previously held equity interest in Higi at its
acquisition date fair value. As no material control premium was determined to exist, estimated consideration transferred to acquire the remaining stake in
Higi was used to estimate the fair value of Babylon Holdings’ previously held equity interest. This remeasurement resulted in gains of approximately $14.6
million and $ 10.8 million, which recorded in Other (income) expense within Babylon Holdings’ pro forma consolidated statement of profit and loss for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred and the preliminary estimated fair values of the major classes of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired has been determined using prior
acquisitions as a benchmark for the purposes of a preliminary purchase price allocation.

Table of Contents
Pro Forma Adjustments
The following pro forma adjustments were added to give effect to Higi acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.
(AA)
Reflects the elimination of the previous investment related to Higi of $12.6 million and the step up to the fair value of prior existing equity interest
of $23.4 million. This step-up in fair value resulted in a gain of $10.8 million.
(BB)
To reflect the elimination of Higi’s historical equity.
(CC)
To reflect the consideration payment in the form of $5.2 million in cash, shares issued as consideration with an estimated fair value of $53.6 million,
fair value of existing equity interest of $23.4 million and $11.6 million in deferred consideration at fair value, resulting in an addition of goodwill of
$56.4 million and $53.6 million in additional paid capital.
(DD)
To reflect the elimination of historical intangible assets of $0.2 million along with the fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $31.9 million
along with its respective impact on Deferred Tax Liabilities of $6.1 million. This results in a reduction of the addition to goodwill by $25.8 million.
Our preliminary estimate of the weighted average useful lives of the acquired intangible assets was determined to be 7.0 years based on the useful
lives assigned to comparable historical acquisitions. The amortization of the intangible assets over a 7.0 year period resulted in an expense of $4.5
million and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively.
(EE)
This adjustment is to reflect the payment of Higi’s debt using its cash on hand. If the cash on hand is not sufficient, part of the consideration
transferred will be used to settle the Related party convertible notes at Closing. This results in a reduction in the cash balance of $5.5 million,
elimination of $7.0 million of debt and a reduction of goodwill by $1.5 million.

Foreign Private Issuer
We are a “foreign private issuer,” as defined by the SEC. As a result, in accordance with the NYSE rules, we will comply with certain of our home
country, Jersey, governance requirements and certain exemptions thereunder rather than complying with the NYSE corporate governance standards.
Under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, the determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most
recently completed second fiscal quarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to us on June 30, 2022. For so long as we
qualify as a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act and the NYSE corporate governance rules that are
applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including:
•
Exemption from filing quarterly reports on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial and other specified information or current reports on
Form 8-K upon the occurrence of specified significant events;
•
Exemption from the requirement to comply with Regulation FD, which regulates selective disclosure of material non-public information by
issuers;
•
Exemption from Section 16 under the Exchange Act, which requires insiders to file public reports of their securities ownership and trading
activities and provides for liability for insiders who profit from trades in a short period of time;
•
Exemption from the NYSE rules applicable to domestic issuers requiring disclosure within four business days of any determination to grant
a waiver of the code of business conduct and ethics to directors and officers;
•
Exemption from the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain issuances of securities, including shareholder approval of share
option plans;
•
Exemption from the requirement that our audit committee have review and oversight responsibilities over all “related party transactions,” as
defined in Item 7.B of Form 20-F;
•
Exemption from the requirement that our board of directors have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent
directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and
•
Exemption from the requirements that director nominees are selected, or recommended for selection by our board of directors, either by (i)
independent directors constituting a majority of our board’s independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate,
or (ii) a committee comprised solely of independent directors, and that a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing
the nominations process is adopted.
Accordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning our business than there would be if we were a U.S. domestic public
company and our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate
governance requirements of the NYSE. We may utilize these exemptions for as long as we continue to qualify as a foreign private issuer.
We intend to comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules applicable to foreign private issuers, which means that we are permitted to follow
certain corporate governance rules that conform to Jersey law requirements in lieu of many of the NYSE corporate governance rules. We may utilize these
exemptions for as long as we continue to qualify as a foreign private issuer.
Composition of our Board of Directors
Our board of directors is currently composed of five members, consisting of Dr. Parsadoust, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Johnson,
our Chief Partnership Officer, and three non-executive directors. As a
267
Table of Contents
foreign private issuer, under the listing requirements and rules of the NYSE, we are not required to have independent directors on our board of directors,
except that our audit committee is required to consist fully of independent directors, subject to certain phase-in schedules. We expect that our board of
directors will determine that none of our non-executive directors has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in
carrying out the responsibilities of director and that each of these three directors is “independent” as that term is defined under the NYSE rules.
Family Relationships
Ali Parsadoust, Babylon Holdings’ Founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, and Mairi Johnson,
Babylon Holdings’ Chief Partnerships Officer and a member of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, are married. There are no other family relationships
among any of our executive officers or directors.
Committees of our Board of Directors
Our board of directors has two standing committees: an audit and risk committee and a remuneration committee. In connection with the Closing, we
intend to establish a nominating and corporate governance committee. Following the Closing, the charters for each of the committees of our board of
directors will be available at the investor relations section of our website.
Audit Committee
Following the Closing, we expect that our audit committee will consist of Messrs. Brilioth, Ganev and Warren. We have determined that each of
Messrs. Brilioth and Ganev meets the requirements for independence under the listing standards of the NYSE and SEC rules and regulations. We expect
to make a determination regarding Mr. Warren’s independence once he joins our board of directors at Closing. Each member of our audit committee will
also meet the requirements for financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE listing rules.
Following the Closing, our audit committee will, among other things:
•
select and hire a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements;
•
oversee our relationship with the independent registered public accounting firm and assess the effectiveness of the external audit process,
including in relation to appointment and tendering, remuneration and other terms of engagement, and appropriate planning ahead of each
annual audit cycle;
•
maintain regular, timely, open and honest communication with the external auditors, ensuring the external auditors report to the committee
on all relevant matters to enable the committee to carry out its oversight responsibilities;
•
monitor the integrity of our financial and narrative reporting, preliminary announcements and any other formal announcements relating to
our financial performance;
•
advise the board on whether, taken as a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable;
•
review the appropriateness and completeness of our risk management and internal controls;
•
consider annually whether we should have an internal audit function;
•
review, approve and/or ratify related party transactions; and
268
Table of Contents
•
approve or, as required, pre-approve, all audit and all permissible non-audit services, other than de minimis non-audit services, to be
performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.
Remuneration Committee
Following the Closing, we expect that our remuneration committee will consist of Messrs. Brilioth and Ganev. As a foreign private issuer, we are not
required to comply with the NYSE listing requirements that would otherwise require our remuneration committee to be comprised entirely of independent
directors. However, currently all of the anticipated members of our remuneration committee are independent under the applicable the NYSE rules and
regulations. Each member of our remuneration committee will also be a non-employee director, as defined pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.
Following the Closing, our remuneration committee will, among other things:
•
set a remuneration policy that is designed to promote our long-term success;
•
ensure that the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives reflects both their individual performance and their
contribution to our overall results;
•
determine the terms of employment and remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives, including recruitment and retention
terms;
•
approve the design and performance targets of any annual incentive schemes that include the executive directors and other senior
executives;
•
agree upon the design and performance targets, where applicable, of all share incentive plans;
•
gather and analyze appropriate data from comparator companies our industry; and
•
select and appoint external advisers to the remuneration committee, if any, to provide independent remuneration advice where necessary.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
In connection with the Closing, we expect to establish a nominating and corporate governance committee, which we expect will consist of Messrs.
Brilioth and Ganev.
Following the Closing, our nominating and corporate governance committee will, among other things:
•
identify individuals qualified to become members of our board of directors;
•
recommend to our board of directors the persons to be nominated for election as directors and to each of the committees of our board of
directors;
•
review and make recommendations to our board of directors with respect to our board leadership structure;
•
review and make recommendations to our board of directors with respect to management succession planning; and
•
develop and recommend to our board of directors corporate governance principles.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
In connection with our listing on the NYSE, we expect to adopt a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that covers a broad range of matters
including the handling of conflicts of interest, compliance issues and other corporate policies such as equal opportunity and non-discrimination
standards.
Directors’ Addresses
Each of the directors can be contacted at the executive office of Babylon.

The principal features of our equity incentive plans and arrangements are summarized below. These summaries are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the actual text of the plans or arrangements, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus
is a part.
2021 Equity Incentive Plan
The 2021 Plan which will be adopted and become effective prior to Closing, allows for the grant of equity-based incentive awards in respect of our
Babylon Class A Shares to our employees and directors, including directors who are also our employees. The material terms of the 2021 Plan are
summarized below.
Eligibility and Administration
Our employees and directors, who are also our employees, and employees of our subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Plan.
Our consultants and directors, who are not employees, and those of our subsidiaries, are eligible to receive awards under the Non-Employee Sub-Plan to
the 2021 Plan described below. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) are together referred to as
service providers below.
Except as otherwise specified, references below to the 2021 Plan include the Non-Employee Sub-Plan.
The 2021 Plan is administered by our board of directors, which may delegate its duties and responsibilities to one or more committees of our
directors and/or officers (referred to as the Plan Administrator below), subject to certain limitations imposed under the 2021 Plan, and other applicable
laws and stock exchange rules. The Plan Administrator has the authority to take all actions and make all determinations under the 2021 Plan, to interpret
the 2021 Plan and award agreements and to adopt, amend and repeal rules for the administration of the 2021 Plan as it deems advisable. The Plan
Administrator also has the authority to determine which eligible service
270Table of Contents
providers receive awards, grant awards, set the terms and conditions of all awards under the 2021 Plan, including any vesting and vesting acceleration
provisions, subject to the conditions and limitations in the 2021 Plan.
Shares Available for Awards
The maximum number of Babylon Class A Shares, or the Share Reserve, that may be issued under our 2021 Plan will be 45,335,210 Babylon Class A
Shares. No more than a number of Babylon Class A Shares equal to the share reserve may be issued under the 2021 Plan upon the exercise of incentive
stock options. In addition, the number of Babylon Class A Shares reserved for issuance under our 2021 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of
each year, commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to 5% of the total number of Babylon Class
A Shares outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year. Our board may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that there will be no
increase for such year or that the increase for such year will be a lesser (but not greater) number of Babylon Class A Shares. Babylon Class A Shares
issued under the 2021 Plan may be new shares, shares purchased on the open market or treasury shares.
If an award under the 2021 Plan, expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, cancelled without having been fully
exercised or forfeited, any unused shares subject to the award will, as applicable, become or again be available for new grants under the 2021 Plan. If an
option granted under the LTIP or the CSOP prior to the effective date expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased,
cancelled without having been fully exercised or forfeited on or after the effective date, any unused shares subject to the option will, as applicable,
become available for new grants under the 2021 Plan and shall be added to the Share Reserve up to a maximum of 23,902,282 Babylon Class A Shares.
Awards granted under the 2021 Plan in substitution for any options or other equity or equity-based awards granted by an entity before the entity’s
merger or consolidation with us or our acquisition of the entity’s property or stock will not reduce the number of Babylon Class A Shares available for
grant under the 2021 Plan, but will count against the maximum number of Babylon Class A Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock
options.
Awards
The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of options, share appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted shares, restricted share units, or RSUs, and other
share-based awards. All awards under the 2021 Plan will be set forth in award agreements, which will detail the terms and conditions of awards, including
any applicable vesting and payment terms, change of control provisions and post-termination exercise limitations. A brief description of each award type
follows.
Options and SARs. Options provide for the purchase of our Babylon Class A Shares in the future at an exercise price set at no less than the nominal
value of a Share and, in respect of participants who are subject to taxation in the United States, no less than the market value of a Share on the grant date.
SARs entitle their holder, upon exercise, to receive from us an amount equal to the appreciation of the Babylon Class A Shares subject to the award
between the grant date and the exercise date. The Plan Administrator will determine the number of Babylon Class A Shares covered by each option and
SAR, and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of each option and SAR.
Restricted shares and RSUs. Restricted shares are an award of non-transferable Babylon Class A Shares that remain forfeitable unless and until
specified conditions are met and which may be subject to a purchase price. RSUs are contractual promises to deliver our Babylon Class A Shares in the
future, which may also remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met. The Plan Administrator may provide that the delivery of the
Babylon Class A Shares underlying RSUs will be deferred on a mandatory basis or at the election of the participant. The terms and conditions applicable
to restricted shares and RSUs will be determined by the Plan Administrator, subject to the conditions and limitations contained in the 2021 Plan.
271
Table of Contents
Other share-based awards. Other share-based awards are awards of fully vested Babylon Class A Shares and other awards valued wholly or
partially by referring to, or otherwise based on, our Babylon Class A Shares or other property. Other share-based awards may be granted to participants
and may also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other awards, as standalone payments and as payment in lieu of compensation to which
a participant is otherwise entitled. The Plan Administrator will determine the terms and conditions of other share-based awards, which may include any
purchase price, performance goal, transfer restrictions and vesting conditions.
Performance Criteria
The Plan Administrator may set performance goals in respect of any awards in its discretion.
Certain Transactions
In connection with certain corporate transactions and events affecting our Babylon Class A Shares, including a change of control, another similar
corporate transaction or event, the Plan Administrator has broad discretion to take action under the 2021 Plan. This includes cancelling awards for cash
or property, accelerating the vesting of awards, providing for the assumption or substitution of awards by a successor entity, adjusting the number and
type of shares subject to outstanding awards and/or with respect to which awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan and replacing or terminating
awards under the 2021 Plan. In addition, in the event of certain equity restructuring transactions, the Plan Administrator will make equitable adjustments
to the limits under the 2021 Plan and outstanding awards as it deems appropriate to reflect the transaction.
Plan Amendment and Termination
Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2021 Plan at any time; however, no amendment may materially and adversely affect an award
outstanding under the 2021 Plan without the consent of the affected participant and shareholder approval will be obtained for any amendment to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable laws. Further, the Plan Administrator will seek the approval of our shareholders in respect of any amendment
to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or the rules of a national exchange on which we are listed. The 2021 Plan will remain in effect until the
tenth anniversary of its effective date unless earlier terminated by our board of directors. No awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan after its
termination.
Transferability and Participant Payments
Except as the Plan Administrator may determine or provide in an award agreement, awards under the 2021 Plan are generally non-transferrable,
except to a participant’s designated beneficiary, as defined in the 2021 Plan. With regard to tax and/or social security withholding obligations arising in
connection with awards under the 2021 Plan, and exercise price obligations arising in connection with the exercise of options under the 2021 Plan, the
Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, accept cash, wire transfer or check, our Babylon Class A Shares that meet specified conditions, a promissory
note, a “market sell order”, such other consideration as the Plan Administrator deems suitable or any combination of the foregoing.
Non-U.S. and Non-U.K. Participants
The Plan Administrator may modify awards granted to participants who are non-U.S. or U.K. nationals or employed outside the United States and
the U.K. or establish sub-plans or procedures to address differences in laws, rules, regulations or customs of such international jurisdictions with respect
to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters or to enable awards to be granted in compliance with a tax favorable regime that may be
available in any jurisdiction.

Table of Contents
Non-Employee Sub-Plan
The Non-Employee Sub-Plan governs equity awards granted to our non-executive directors, consultants, advisers and other non-employee service
providers and provides for awards to be made on identical terms to awards made under our 2021 Plan.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP was adopted on July 27, 2015. Various amendments to the LTIP, including the addition of a U.S Appendix and Non-Employee Sub-Plan
were subsequently approved by the board of directors and, in the case of the U.S. Appendix, approved by shareholders. References to the LTIP include
the U.S. Appendix and Non-Employee Sub-Plan except as otherwise indicated.
Options granted under the U.S. Appendix may be granted in the form of potentially tax advantaged incentive stock options. Other options granted
under the LTIP are not intended to qualify for any tax advantageous treatment.
Options granted under the LTIP were originally granted over Babylon Holdings Class B Shares. Following the Reclassification, the options subsist
over Babylon Class A Shares.
Options granted under the U.S Appendix must have an exercise price equal to or more than the market value of a share on the date of grant. There
is no minimum exercise price for other options granted under the LTIP, provided that arrangements are made for the nominal value of a share to be paid up.
Participation / Eligibility and Administration
Options granted under the LTIP are granted by the board of directors in its absolute discretion to employees. Advisors and consultants are eligible
to be granted options under the Non-Employee Sub-Plan.
Vesting and Exercise of Options
Options granted under the LTIP may be granted subject to a vesting schedule containing one or more time-based conditions and additionally, or in

Amendments to the LTIP

Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The CSOP was adopted on February 24, 2021 and is intended to qualify as a company share option plan that meets the requirements of Schedule 4
to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (“ITEPA”). Options granted under the CSOP are, subject to certain qualifying conditions being met,
potentially U.K. tax favored options up to an individual limit of £30,000 calculated by reference to the market value of the shares under option at the date
of grant.
Options granted under the CSOP were originally granted over Babylon Holdings Class B Shares. Following the Reclassification, the options
subsist over Babylon Class A Shares.
Options granted under the CSOP must have an exercise price equal to or more than the market value of a share on the date of grant and, where the
exercise of an option is to be satisfied by newly issued shares, the exercise price must not be less than the nominal value of a share.
Participation / Eligibility and Administration
Options granted under the CSOP are granted by the board of directors in its absolute discretion to employees that qualify to be granted an option
under Schedule 4 of ITEPA.
Vesting and Exercise of Options
Options granted under the CSOP may be granted subject to a vesting schedule containing one or more time-based conditions and additionally, or in
the alternative, specific performance conditions that must be met before all or part of an option can be exercised. The board of directors may accelerate
vesting of an option and/or vary or waive one or more performance conditions attaching to an option in certain circumstances.

the earliest of (1) termination of the option holder’s employment in certain good leaver circumstances; (2) an exit event, including an initial public offering;
or (3) 30 days prior to the expiry date of the option. Options shall become exercisable to the extent vested upon completion of this offering and shall
continue to vest and become exercisable in accordance with their terms.

directors may determine that adjustments are made to the number of shares under option, the exercise price and / or the description of the shares under
options, subject to certain conditions and the relevant provisions of ITEPA.
Amendments to the CSOP
The board of directors can amend the CSOP from time to time save that such amendments (1) cannot be made if it would mean that the CSOP would
no longer qualify under Schedule 4 of ITEPA; (2) cannot be made without option holders’ prior written consent if the amendment is material.
Restricted B Shares (CSOP Plus)
Prior to the Reclassification, certain of our employees held the beneficial interest in certain Babylon B ordinary shares, which were subject to
vesting and forfeiture pursuant to individual award agreements. In connection with the Reclassification these Babylon B ordinary shares re-designated as
Babylon Class A Shares. These Babylon Class A Shares are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture terms as applied to the relevant Babylon B
ordinary shares. The legal title to these Babylon Class A Shares is held by a third party employee benefit trust.
275
Table of Contents
Growth Shares
Prior to the Reclassification, certain of our employees hold Babylon Holdings Class G1 Shares which are subject to a hurdle and forfeiture under the
terms of Babylon Holdings’ existing articles of association and vesting on the terms of individual award agreements. In connection with the
Reclassification, these Babylon Holdings Class G1 Shares will be converted into Babylon Holdings Class B Shares pursuant to a conversion ratio
determined by reference to the relative values of the Babylon Holdings Class G1 Shares and the Babylon Holdings Class B Shares and will be
subsequently re-designated as Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Transactions. These Babylon Class A Shares are subject to the same vesting and
forfeiture terms as applied to the relevant Babylon Holdings Class G1 Shares.
Non-Executive Director Compensation
We intend to approve a non-employee director compensation policy that will be in effect upon Closing.
Agreements with Executive Officers
We have entered into written employment agreements with our executive officers. The agreements of Messrs. Parsadoust and Steel provide notice
periods with respect to termination of the agreement by us or by the relevant executive officer, during which time the executive officer will continue to
receive salary and benefits; provided that we may provide payment in lieu of all or a portion of the notice period. The written employment agreements
with our other executive officers are at-will, and generally provide for customary severance.
Insurance and Indemnification
To the extent permitted under Jersey law, we are empowered to indemnify our directors against any liability they incur by reason of their
directorship. We plan to obtain directors’ and officers’ insurance to insure such persons against certain liabilities. Insofar as indemnification of liabilities
arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our board, executive officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we
have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore
unenforceable.

Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Alkuri
Sponsor Shares
In December 2020, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. The number of shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock issued to the Sponsor was determined based on the
expectation that such shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock upon completion
of the Alkuri IPO. The shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock (including the Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not,
subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.
Alkuri Private Placement Warrants
The Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrants in a private placement that occurred
simultaneously with the closing of the Alkuri IPO. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A
Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
thereof) may not, subject to certain limitation, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.
Agreements with Directors and Officers and their Affiliates
No compensation of any kind, including any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid
by us to the Sponsor, Alkuri’s officers and directors, or any affiliate of the Sponsor or Alkuri’s officers, prior to, or in connection with any services
rendered in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these
individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on Alkuri’s behalf, such as identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Alkuri does not have a policy that prohibits the Sponsor, executive
officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Alkuri’s
audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors, or any of their affiliates and will
determinate which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on Alkuri’s behalf.
Affiliate Loans
The Sponsor agreed to loan Alkuri up to an aggregate of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the Alkuri IPO. Alkuri had borrowed
$300,000 under such promissory note and repaid $300,000 upon the closing of the Alkuri IPO out of the offering proceeds that had been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account.
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the
Sponsor or certain of Alkuri’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan Alkuri funds as may be required. If Alkuri complete an initial
business combination, Alkuri would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, Alkuri may use a
portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from Alkuri’s trust account would be used
for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants discussed above, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The
terms of such loans by Alkuri’s officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
277Table of Contents
with respect to such loans. Alkuri does not expect to seek loans from parties other than the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor as Alkuri does not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in Alkuri’s trust account.
Consulting, Management, and Other Fees
After the Business Combination, members of Alkuri’s management team who remain with Babylon may be paid consulting, management or other
fees from Babylon with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to Alkuri Stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or
tender offer documents, as applicable, furnished to Alkuri Stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of
distribution of such proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business
to determine executive and director compensation.
Registration Rights
Alkuri has entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, the warrants issuable upon conversion of
working capital loans (if any) and the shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the Alkuri
Class B Common Stock. In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, this registration rights agreement was amended and restated as more
fully described below under “Agreements Entered Into in Connection with the Merger Agreement—Registration Rights Agreement.”
Material Agreements
Alkuri has agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon
Closing, Alkuri will cease paying the Sponsor these monthly fees.

August 1, 2019, between Babylon Holdings and NNS, the converting notes did not include those notes held by NNS.
On June 3, 2020, in connection with Babylon Holdings’ investment into Higi, ALP, as lender, entered into a promissory note with Higi, as borrower,
in which Higi promises to pay ALP an aggregate principal sum of $5 million (the “ALP Note”). The ALP Note is expected to be paid off in connection with
the Higi acquisition and, pursuant to the ALP Note, Higi is obligated to repay interest for two years in the aggregate in addition to the principal amount.

Babylon Holdings had originally anticipated agreement on the Business Combination several months earlier than it was originally agreed due to
market conditions. As such, it has subsequently obtained bridge financing to address short-term cash flow needs pending consummation of the
Business Combination. Accordingly, on July 15, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a loan agreement with VNV Group for $15.0 million. The interest rate
on the loan is 14%. This loan agreement is expected to be repaid upon consummation of the Business Combination.
On August 18, 2021, Babylon Holdings issued $50.0 million in unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (“Unsecured Bonds”), including the non-
cash conversion of $8.0 million in borrowings under the loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The
interest rate on the loan is 10%, with interest payable quarterly. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds can be used for general corporate purposes.
The Company utilized proceeds of $7.2 million from the Unsecured Bonds to settle the remainder of the loan and interest with VNV (Cyprus) Limited. Cash
proceeds from the bond issuance, net of discounts, repayments of borrowings, and transaction expenses totalled approximately $32.1 million. The
Unsecured Bonds have a one year term and they can be redeemed by Babylon Holdings at any time. Payment of the bonds is mandatory upon
completion of a business combination or change in control. Babylon Holdings must maintain a minimum cash balance of $10.0 million to comply with
financial covenants.

A summary of the material provisions governing Babylon’s share capital immediately following the completion of the Business Combination is
provided below. This summary is not complete and should be read together with the Babylon Articles, a copy of which is appended to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex B. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Babylon.
The following is a description of the material terms of the Babylon Articles that will be in effect upon the Closing of the Business Combination. The
following descriptions of share capital and provisions of the Babylon Articles are summaries and are qualified by reference to the Babylon Articles, a
copy of which is appended to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this
proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. The description of the ordinary shares reflects changes to our capital structure that will occur upon the closing
of the Transactions.
Share Capital
Upon the Closing of the Business Combination, Babylon’s authorized share capital will be $409,896.05 divided into 6,500,000,000 Class A ordinary
shares with a par or nominal value of $0.0000422573245084686 each (the “Babylon Class A Shares”), 3,100,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par
value of $0.0000422573245084686 each (the “Babylon Class B Shares”), and 100,000,000 deferred shares with a par value of $0.0000422573245084686 each.
Following the Closing, there will be 361,714,531 Babylon Class A Shares, 79,637,576 Babylon Class B Shares and no deferred shares outstanding. Each
issued Babylon Share is fully paid.
Conversion of Babylon Class B Shares
The Babylon Articles contain both mandatory and optional mechanics whereby Babylon Class B Shares may be converted into Babylon Class A
Shares.
From a mandatory perspective, Babylon Class B Shares will automatically convert and immediately be treated as Babylon Class A Shares in the
following circumstances:
•
with the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds by nominal value of the issued Babylon Class B Shares;
•
upon any transfer of the Babylon Class B Shares to any person (other than to specified permitted transferees of Ali Parsadoust);
•
where any of the Babylon Class B Shares cease to be beneficially owned at any time by Dr. Ali Parsadoust or any of his permitted
transferees;
•
on such date that (i) Dr. Parsadoust (together with any of his permitted transferees) no longer hold at least five per cent of the Babylon
Class B Shares held by Dr. Parsadoust (together with his permitted transferees) at the Closing of the Business Combination and (ii) is either
(a) at least 12 months following Dr. Parsadoust’s voluntary resignation as CEO and director of Babylon or (b) at least 12 months following
the death or permanent incapacity of Dr. Parsadoust.
The Babylon Articles also contain a series of optional conversion mechanics for the Babylon Class B Shares, primarily that a holder of Babylon
Class B Shares is entitled at any time to convert all (or part) of their holding of fully-paid Babylon Class B Shares to the same number of fully paid
Babylon Class A Shares by delivering to the company (or its representative) written notice of such conversion (and in the case of a certificated share, the
certificate(s) representing the Babylon Class B Shares to be converted.
282Table of Contents
Voting Rights
Subject to the rights attaching to the relevant shares in the Babylon Articles, holders of Babylon Class A Shares will be entitled to cast one (1) vote
per Babylon Class A Shares, and holders of Babylon Class B Shares will be entitled to cast fifteen (15) votes per Babylon Class B Shares. Deferred shares
carry no voting rights.
Shareholder Meetings
General Meetings
An annual general meeting and any other shareholders’ meeting (whether convened for the passing of an ordinary or a special resolution) shall be
called by at least 14 days’ notice given to all of the members, directors and auditors.
Special Meetings
Under the Jersey Companies Law, only our board of directors or shareholders holding at least 10% of the total voting rights of our share capital can
requisition a shareholders’ meeting. A meeting requisitioned by shareholders must be held within two months of receipt by us of the written request, but
such shareholders may call the meeting if our board of directors does not call the meeting within 21 days of the date of deposit of the written request at
our registered office, in which event such meeting must be held within three months of the date of deposit of the written request of our registered office.
Action by Written Consent
The Babylon Articles prohibit the passing of a resolution of the shareholders in writing, save that where the holder(s) of Babylon Class B Shares
hold at least a simple majority of the total voting rights held by the shareholders of Babylon, a resolution in writing (be that an ordinary or special
resolution, but excluding a resolution removing an auditor) which is signed by shareholders who would be entitled to receive notice of and attend and
vote at a general meeting at which such resolution would be proposed and which represent such number of the voting rights as would be required to
pass the resolutions on a poll taken at the meeting of those shareholders, shall be valid and effectual. Upon Closing, the Founder will hold all outstanding
Babylon Class B Shares and a simple majority of the total voting rights held by shareholders of Babylon. Consequently, the Founder will have sufficient
voting control over Babylon to approve matters subject to shareholder approval by written consent, without prior notice and without submitting matters
to the other shareholders for approval.
Board of Directors
Election of Directors
Under the Babylon Articles, our board of directors shall not, unless otherwise determined by an ordinary resolution of the company, be less than
three but is not subject to a maximum number. We currently have five members on our board of directors, and we expect that there will be six directors
following the Closing of the Business Combination. Shareholders are only able to appoint a person as a director at a shareholder meeting if either (i) the
relevant person has been recommended by our board of directors or is a serving director who is retiring at that shareholder meeting; or (ii) if a shareholder
(other than the person proposed as a director) who is entitled to attend and vote at that shareholder meeting has submitted written notice to us of their
intention to nominate the relevant person no less than 90 and no more than 120 full days prior to the date of that shareholder meeting, along with a notice
from the relevant person confirming their willingness to be appointed. In addition, the board of directors itself may appoint any person who is willing to
act to be a director, subject to maximum director limitations.
Removal of Directors
Under the Babylon Articles, each director of the board of directors who holds such office on the date that is seven days before the notice of
Babylon’s annual general meeting shall retire from office and shall be subject to re-election at each annual general meeting.
283
Table of Contents
Babylon may also remove a director, notwithstanding the above or in any agreement between a relevant director and Babylon, by an ordinary
resolution of shareholders.
Directors’ Conflict of Interests
An interested director must disclose to the company the nature and extent of any interest in a transaction with the company, or one of its
subsidiaries, which to a material extent conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the company and of which the director is aware. Failure to disclose
an interest entitles the company or a shareholder to apply to the court for an order setting aside the transaction concerned and directing that the director
account to the company for any profit or gain realized. A director shall not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting) in respect of any resolution
concerning that director’s own appointment or termination, and may not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting) in respect of any resolution
relating to a transaction or arrangement of the company in which that director has an interests which may reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to
a conflict of interest, subject only to certain exceptions (including that the resolutions concerns a transaction or arrangement in which the director is
interested by virtue of an interest in shares, debentures or other securities of the company or otherwise in or through the company).
A transaction is not voidable and a director is not accountable notwithstanding a failure to disclose an interest if the transaction is confirmed by
special resolution and the nature and extent of the director’s interest in the transaction are disclosed in reasonable detail in the notice calling the meeting
at which the resolution is passed.
Although it may still order that a director account for any profit, a court will not set aside a transaction unless it is satisfied that the interests of third
parties who have acted in good faith would not thereby be unfairly prejudiced and the transaction was not reasonable and fair in the interests of the
company at the time it was entered into.
Transfer of Shares
Under the Babylon Articles, a member is permitted to transfer all or any of their shares in any manner which is permitted by Jersey Companies Law,
subject to certain restrictions in respect of lock-up provisions. See “Agreements Entered Into in Connection with the Merger Agreement—Lockup
Agreement.”
Dividends and Liquidation Rights
Subject to Babylon agreeing with any member that all or any part of the Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares held by such member
(from time-to-time) shall be subject to provisions set out in a separate agreement, the holders of such Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares
are entitled to receive dividends in proportion to the number of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares held by them. Holders of Babylon
Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares are entitled, in proportion to the number of ordinary shares held by them, to participate in a return of assets
upon a liquidation/winding-up. Holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive any dividend or distribution declared, nor are they entitled to share
in any surplus on a winding up of Babylon.
Variation of Rights
The rights attached to any class of Babylon Shares may only be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of at least three quarters in
nominal value of the issued shares of the relevant class, or with the authority of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of those
shares.
The consent in writing of the holders of more than half of the issued Babylon Class B Shares is required for any amendment to the powers,
preferences or other rights attached to the Babylon Class A Shares; any dividend or other distribution to the Babylon Class A Shares which is not made
pro rata to the Babylon Class B Shares; or
284
Table of Contents
any proposal to treat the Babylon Class A Shares differently from the Babylon Class B Shares with respect to any consolidation, subdivision,
recapitalization or similar, with respect to any consideration in to which the shares are converted or any consideration paid or otherwise distributed to
Babylon’s shareholders upon a change of control following a listing, in each case where such action would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the
rights attaching to the Babylon Class B Shares.
The consent in writing of the holders of more than half of the issued Babylon Class A Shares is required for any amendment to the powers,
preferences or other rights attached to the Babylon Class B Shares; any dividend or other distribution to the Babylon Class B Shares which is not made
pro rata to the Babylon Class A Shares; or any proposal to treat the Babylon Class B Shares differently from the Babylon Class A Shares with respect to
any consolidation, subdivision, recapitalization or similar, with respect to any consideration in to which the shares are converted or any consideration
paid or otherwise distributed to Babylon’s shareholders upon a change of control following a listing, in each case where such action would be reasonably
likely to adversely affect the rights attaching to the Babylon Class A Shares.
Options
The board of directors is able to exercise the powers of Babylon in order to, amongst other actions, establish, maintain, adopt and enable
participation in any profit sharing or incentive scheme including shares, share options or cash or similar schemes for the benefit of any director or
employee of Babylon. In addition, the board of directors has broad rights (subject to Jersey Companies Law, the Babylon Articles and any resolution of
Babylon) to generally grant options over any unissued shares in Babylon on such terms as the board may decide.
Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Articles of Association
General
The Babylon Articles will contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiring or seeking
to acquire control of us. These provisions are designed to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These
provisions are also intended to encourage anyone seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. However, these
provisions may also delay, deter or prevent a change in control or other takeovers of our company that our shareholders might consider to be in their best
interests, including transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares
and also may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares. These provisions
may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. We believe that the benefits of increased protection give us the potential ability to
negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us, and that the benefits of this increased protection
outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging those proposals, because negotiation of those proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. A
description of these provisions is set forth below.
Dual Class
As described above in “ —Voting Rights,” the Babylon Articles provide for a dual class share capital structure, as a result of which holders of
Babylon Class B Shares will be entitled to 15 votes per share, while holders of Babylon Class A Shares are entitled to one vote per share. This will
provide holders of Babylon Class B Shares with significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of
directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Babylon or its assets.
Advance Notice Procedure
The Babylon Articles will provide that a shareholder of Babylon may propose the nomination of a candidate to be elected as a director at a general
meeting. Such shareholder must, among other things, provide notice
285
Table of Contents
thereof in writing to Babylon not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the meeting.
The notice must contain, among other things, the particulars which would, if the person were so elected to the position of director, be required to
be included in Babylon’s register of directors and a notice executed by the person of the person’s willingness to be elected.
Exclusive Forum Provision
The Babylon Articles will provide that, unless Babylon consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Courts of Jersey shall (to
the fullest extent permitted by law) be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty by Babylon
directors and officers, actions arising out of Jersey Companies Law or actions arising out of or in connection with the Babylon Articles (pursuant to any
provisions of Jersey law) or otherwise relating to the constitution or conduct of the company itself (other than any such action of the company that may
arise out of a breach of any federal law of the United States or the laws of any U.S. state). The exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative
shareholder actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from
asserting jurisdiction over such claims. In addition, unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, U.S federal district
courts shall be the sole and exclusive form for any resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.
Limitation of Liability of Directors and Officers
To the maximum extent permitted by Jersey law, the Babylon Articles will include provisions that indemnify the personal liability of directors or
officers incurred by them for negligence, default, breach of duty or otherwise in relation to the company. The Babylon Articles also enable the board to
purchase and maintain relevant insurance for the benefit of Babylon’s directors, officers, employees or auditors.
We believe that the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in the Babylon Articles and the indemnification agreements will facilitate
our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under
the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been
informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
General Other Jersey, Channel Islands Law Considerations
Dividends and other distributions
We may not pay any dividend (whether in cash or assets) unless our directors who are to authorize the dividend have made a statutory solvency
statement that, immediately following the date on which the payment is proposed to be made, Babylon will be able to discharge its liabilities as they fall
due and, having regard to certain prescribed factors including the directors’ intentions regarding the management of Babylon, Babylon will be able to
continue to carry on business and discharge its liabilities as they fall due for the 12 months immediately following the date on which the payment is
proposed to be made (or until Babylon is dissolved on a solvent basis, if earlier).
Dividends may not be debited to the company’s nominal capital account or any capital redemption reserve, but may be debited to a share premium
account. Jersey law does not require that a company has positive profit and loss, retained earnings or similar in order for a dividend to be lawfully paid.
The foregoing also applies to certain types of other distributions made by a Jersey company.
286
Table of Contents
Purchase of Own Shares
As with declaring a dividend, we may not buy back or redeem our shares unless our directors who are to authorize the buyback or redemption have
made a statutory solvency statement that, immediately following the date on which the buyback or redemption is proposed to be made, the company will
be able to discharge its liabilities as they fall due and, having regard to certain prescribed factors including the directors’ intentions regarding the
management of the company, the company will be able to continue to carry on business and discharge its liabilities as they fall due for the 12 months
immediately following the date on which the buyback or redemption is proposed to be made (or until the company is dissolved on a solvent basis, if
earlier).
If the above conditions are met, we may purchase shares in the manner described below.
We may purchase on a stock exchange our own fully paid shares pursuant to a special resolution of our shareholders. The resolution authorizing
the purchase must specify:
•
the maximum number of shares to be purchased;
•
the maximum and minimum prices which may be paid; and
•
a date, not being later than five years after the passing of the resolution, on which the authority to purchase is to expire.
We may purchase our own fully paid shares otherwise than on a stock exchange pursuant to a special resolution of our shareholders, but only if
the purchase is made on the terms of a written purchase contract which has been approved by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. The
shareholder from whom we propose to purchase or redeem shares is not entitled to vote the shares being purchased on such resolutions.
We may fund a redemption or purchase of our own shares from any source. We cannot purchase our shares if, as a result of such purchase, only
redeemable shares would remain in issue.
If authorized by a resolution of our shareholders, any shares that we redeem or purchase may be held by us as treasury shares. Any shares held by
us as treasury shares may be cancelled, sold, transferred for the purposes of or under an employee share scheme or held without cancelling, selling or
transferring them. Shares redeemed or purchased by us are cancelled where we have not been authorized to hold these as treasury shares.
Mandatory Purchases and Acquisitions
The Jersey Companies Law provides that where a person has made an offer to acquire a class of all of our outstanding shares not already held by
the person and has as a result of such offer acquired or contractually agreed to acquire 90% or more of such outstanding shares, that person is then
entitled (and may be required) to acquire the remaining shares of such shares. In such circumstances, a holder of any such remaining shares may apply to
the Jersey court for an order that the person making such offer not be entitled to purchase the holder’s shares or that the person purchase the holder’s
shares on terms different to those under which the person made such offer.
Other than as described above and below under “ —U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers,” we are not subject to any regulations under
which a shareholder that acquires a certain level of share ownership is then required to offer to purchase all of our remaining shares on the same terms as
such shareholder’s prior purchase.
Compromises and Arrangements
Where we and our creditors or shareholders or a class of either of them propose a compromise or arrangement between us and our creditors or our
shareholders or a class of either of them (as applicable), the Jersey court may order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors or of our shareholders
or class of
287
Table of Contents
shareholders (as applicable) to be called in such a manner as the court directs. Any compromise or arrangement approved by a majority in number
representing 75% or more in value of the creditors or 75% or more of the voting rights of shareholders or class of either of them (as applicable) if
sanctioned by the court, is binding upon us and all the creditors, shareholders or members of the specific class of either of them (as applicable).
Whether the capital of the company is to be treated as being divided into a single or multiple class(es) of shares is a matter to be determined by the
court. The court may in its discretion treat a single class of shares as multiple classes, or multiple classes of shares as a single class, for the purposes of
the shareholder approval referred to above taking into account all relevant circumstances, which may include circumstances other than the rights
attaching to the shares themselves.
U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers
The U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the “Takeover Code”), applies, among other things, to an offer for a public company whose
registered office is in the Channel Islands and whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility in the
United Kingdom or any stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man if the company is considered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers
(the “Takeover Panel”), to have its place of central management and control in the United Kingdom or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man (in each
case, a “Code Company”). This is known as the “residency test.” Under the Takeover Code, the Takeover Panel will determine whether we have our place
of central management and control in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man by looking at various factors, including the structure of
our board of directors, the functions of the directors and where they are resident.
The Takeover Code provides a framework within which takeovers of companies subject to it are conducted. In particular, the Takeover Code
contains certain rules in respect of mandatory offers for Code Companies. Under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, if a person:
•
acquires an interest in shares of a Code Company that, when taken together with shares in which persons acting in concert with such
person are interested, carry 30% or more of the voting rights of the Code Company; or
•
who, together with persons acting in concert with such person, is interested in shares that in the aggregate carry not less than 30% and not
more than 50% of the voting rights in the Code, acquires additional interests in shares that increase the percentage of shares carrying
voting rights in which that person is interested;
•
the acquirer, and, depending on the circumstances, its concert parties, would be required (except with the consent of the Takeover Panel) to
make a cash offer (or provide a cash alternative) for the Code Company’s outstanding shares at a price not less than the highest price paid
for any interests in the shares by the acquirer or its concert parties during the previous 12 months.
Babylon will not be subject to the Takeover Code upon the Closing, but may in the future become subject to the Takeover Code in the event of
changes in the board’s composition, changes to the Takeover Code or other relevant change of circumstances.
Rights of Minority Shareholders
Under Article 141 of the Jersey Companies Law, a shareholder may apply to court for relief on the grounds that the conduct of our affairs, including
a proposed or actual act or omission by us, is “unfairly prejudicial” to the interests of our shareholders generally or of some part of our shareholders,
including at least the shareholder making the application. What amounts to unfair prejudice is not defined in the Jersey Companies Law. There may also
be common law personal actions available to our shareholders.
Under Article 143 of the Jersey Companies Law (which sets out the types of relief a court may grant in relation to an action brought under Article
141 of the Jersey Companies Law), the court may make an order
288
Table of Contents
regulating our affairs, requiring us to refrain from doing or continuing to do an act complained of, authorizing civil proceedings and providing for the
purchase of shares by us or by any of our other shareholders.
Jersey Regulatory Matters

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,DESCRIPTION OF BABYLON WARRANTS,"DESCRIPTION OF BABYLON WARRANTS
Public Warrants
Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Babylon Class A Share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time
commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of the Alkuri IPO or 30 days after the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of ordinary shares. This means that
only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants will be issued and only whole warrants will trade. The
warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the date that is five years after the date of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
Babylon will not be obligated to deliver any ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant
exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Babylon Class A Shares underlying the Babylon Warrants is then
effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to Babylon satisfying its registration obligations. No warrant will be exercisable and
Babylon will not be obligated to issue ordinary shares upon exercise of a warrant unless ordinary shares issuable upon such warrant exercise have been
registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that
the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to
exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will Babylon be required to net cash settle any warrant.
If a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day
following the closing of the Business Combination or during any period when Babylon has failed to maintain an effective registration statement, warrant
holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not
be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.
Babylon may call the warrants for redemption:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at a price of $0.01 per warrant when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00;
•
at a price of $0.10 per warrant when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00;
•
upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder;
•
if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares of Babylon equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing on the
date of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and ending three business days before Babylon
sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
•
if, and only if, the closing price of the ordinary shares of Babylon equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the
number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant and the like) for any 20 trading days within the 30-day period
ending three trading days before Babylon sends notice of the redemption to the warrant holders.
If and when the warrants become redeemable by Babylon, Babylon may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of ordinary shares upon
exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Babylon is unable to effect such
registration or qualification.
291Table of Contents
Babylon established the last of the redemption criteria discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a
significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and Babylon issues a notice of redemption of the warrants, each
warrant holder will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the ordinary shares may fall below the
$18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the $11.50 warrant
exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.
A holder of a warrant may notify Babylon in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to
exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s
actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9% or 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the ordinary shares outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such exercise.
If the number of outstanding ordinary shares is increased by a stock dividend payable in ordinary shares, or by a split-up of ordinary shares or
other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each
warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the number of outstanding ordinary shares. A rights offering to holders of ordinary shares
entitling holders to purchase ordinary shares at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of ordinary shares
equal to the product of (i) the number of ordinary shares actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such
rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for ordinary shares) and (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per ordinary share paid in
such rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for
ordinary shares, in determining the price payable for ordinary shares, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well
as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of ordinary shares as
reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the ordinary shares trade on the applicable
exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.
In addition, if Babylon, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pays a dividend or makes a distribution in cash, securities or
other assets to the holders of ordinary shares on account of such ordinary shares (or other shares of Babylon’s capital stock into which the warrants are
convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Alkuri Class A
Common Stock in connection with the Business Combination, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Alkuri Class A Common Stock in
connection with the stockholder vote to amend the Alkuri amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) modify the substance or timing of
Babylon’s obligation to provide for the redemption of Babylon’s ordinary shares in connection with the Business Combination or to redeem 100% of
Alkuri’s shares if an initial business combination is not completed within 24 months from the closing of the Alkuri IPO or (ii) with respect to any other
material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, or (e) in connection with the redemption of shares upon
the failure of Alkuri to complete a business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of
such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each ordinary share in respect of such event.
If the number of outstanding ordinary shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of ordinary shares
or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of
ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding ordinary shares.
Whenever the number of ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price
will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number
of ordinary
292
Table of Contents
shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of
ordinary shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.
In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding ordinary shares (other than those described above or that solely affects the par
value of such ordinary shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of Babylon with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or
merger in which Babylon is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of Babylon’s outstanding
ordinary shares), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of the combines company as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which it is dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and
receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the ordinary shares immediately theretofore
purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of ordinary shares or other securities or property
(including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer,
that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. If less than 70% of the
consideration receivable by the holders of ordinary shares in such a transaction is payable in the form of Class A Stock in the successor entity that is
listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted
immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure
of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement, based on the Black-Scholes value (as defined in the
warrant agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of such exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to holders of the warrants when an
extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the warrants pursuant to which the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full
potential value of the warrants in order to determine and realize the option value component of the warrant. This formula is to compensate the warrant
holder for the loss of the option value portion of the warrant due to the requirement that the warrant holder exercise the warrant within 30 days of the
event. The Black-Scholes model is an accepted pricing model for estimating fair market value where no quoted market price for an instrument is available.
The warrants will be issued in registered form pursuant to the warrant agreement, by and between Continental, as warrant agent, and Babylon. You
should review a copy of the warrant agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to this proxy statement/prospectus for a complete description of the terms and
conditions applicable to the warrants. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder
to cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants
and the warrant agreement set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus, or to correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of
at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public
warrants.
The warrant agreement, as amended by the warrant assumption and amendment agreement, provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action,
proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of
New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which
jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such
courts represent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to
enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of
America are the sole and exclusive forum.
The warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with
the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or
on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to Babylon, for the number of warrants being exercised.

The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive
ordinary shares. After the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share held of
record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.
No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional
interest in a share, Babylon will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder.
Private Warrants
The private placement warrants (including the ordinary shares underlying the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or
salable until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination, except among certain limited exceptions to Babylon’s officers and directors and to
persons or entities affiliated with the Sponsor.
The private placement warrants will not be redeemable by Babylon so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The
Sponsor, or its permitted transferees, has the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. Except as described below, the private
placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the public warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. If the private warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the private warrants will be redeemable by
Babylon and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the public warrants. If holders of the private warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless
basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)
the product of the number of shares of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (defined below) over
the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” means the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for
the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent.

AND ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS
The rights of the shareholders of Babylon and the relative powers of the Babylon board of directors are governed by the laws of the Bailiwick of
Jersey and the Babylon Articles. As a result of the Transactions, securities held by the Alkuri Stockholders will be canceled and automatically converted
into the right to receive Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants. Each Babylon Share will be issued in accordance with, and subject to the
rights and obligations of, the Babylon Articles which will be effective upon the consummation of the Transactions, in substantially the form attached
hereto as Annex B. Because Babylon will be, at the Effective Time, a company organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, the rights of the
stockholders of Alkuri will be governed by Jersey law and the Babylon Articles.
Many of the principal attributes of Babylon Shares and Alkuri Common Stock will be similar. However, there are differences between the rights of
shareholders of Babylon under Jersey law and the rights of stockholders of Alkuri, as in effect prior to the consummation of the Transactions under the
DGCL. In addition, there are differences between the Babylon Articles as such will be in effect from and after the consummation of the Transactions and
the SPAC Charter and bylaws of Alkuri.
The following is a summary comparison of the material differences between the rights of Alkuri securityholders under the SPAC Charter, Alkuri
bylaws and the DGCL, and the rights of Babylon shareholders under Jersey law and the Babylon Articles to be effective upon consummation of the
Transactions. The discussion in this section does not include a description of rights or obligations under the United States federal securities laws or the
NYSE listing requirements or of Babylon’s or Alkuri’s governance or other policies.
The statements in this section are a summary of the material rights of shareholders under the Jersey Companies Law, the Babylon Articles, the
DGCL and the SPAC Charter and bylaws of Alkuri as they will be in effect from and after the Effective Time. The SPAC Charter is filed as an exhibit to the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. You are also urged to carefully read the Jersey Companies Law and the
DGCL.

However, under the Jersey Companies Law,
shareholders holding 10% or more of the
company’s voting rights and entitled to
vote at the relevant meeting may requisition
the directors to call a meeting of
shareholders. This must be held as soon as
practicable but in any case not later than
two months after the date of the deposit of
the requisition. The requisition shall state
the objects of the meeting. If the directors
do not within 21 days from the date of the
deposit of the requisition proceed to call a
meeting to be held within two months of
that date, the requisitionists, or any of them
representing more than half of the total
voting rights of all of them, may themselves

Approval of Corporate Matters by Written Consent
No action required or permitted to be taken by
the stockholders of Alkuri at an annual or special
meeting may be taken by written consent, except
that any action required or permitted to be taken
by the holders of the Alkuri Class B Common
Stock may be effected by written consent.
Under the Jersey Companies Law, unless
prohibited by a company’s articles of
association, a unanimous written consent
by each shareholder entitled to vote on the
matter may effect any matter that otherwise
may be brought before a shareholders’
meeting, except for the removal of auditors.
Such consent shall be deemed effective
when the instrument, or the last of several
instruments, is last signed or on such later
date as is specified in the resolution.
Furthermore, a company’s articles of
association may permit written resolutions
to be passed by such number of members
that would be required to pass the
resolutions at a general meeting.
Unless prohibited by a company’s articles
of association, the members of a company
have a power to require a company to
circulate a resolution that may properly be
proposed and is to be proposed as a written
resolution.
The Babylon Articles prohibit the passing
of resolutions in writing by the
shareholders, except where the holders of
Babylon Class B Shares hold not less than a
simple majority of the total voting rights

Interested Shareholders Transactions
The DGCL contains a business combination
statute applicable to Delaware corporations
whereby, unless the corporation has specifically
elected not to be governed by such statute by
amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is
prohibited from engaging in certain business
combinations with an “interested shareholder”
for three years following the date that such
person becomes an interested shareholder. An
interested shareholder generally is a person or a
group who or which owns or
The Jersey Companies Law has no
comparable provision. As a result, Babylon
cannot avail itself of the types of
protections afforded by the Delaware
business combination statute. However,
although Jersey law does not regulate
transactions between a company and its
significant shareholders, as a general matter,
such transactions must be entered into
bona fide in the best interests of the
company and not with the effect of
constituting a fraud on the minority
shareholders.
298
Table of Contents
Alkuri
Babylon
owned more than 15% of the target’s
outstanding voting stock within the past three
years.
This has the effect of limiting the ability of a
potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the
target in which all shareholders would not be
treated equally. The statute does not apply if,
among other things, prior to the date on which
such shareholder becomes an interested
shareholder, the board of directors approves
either the business combination or the
transaction which resulted in the person
becoming an interested shareholder. This
encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware
corporation to negotiate the terms of any
acquisition transaction with the target’s board of
directors.
Interested Director Transactions
Interested director transactions are permissible
and may not be legally voided if:
•  either a majority of disinterested directors,
or a majority in interest of holders of shares
of the corporation’s capital stock entitled to
vote upon the matter, approves the
transaction upon disclosure of all material
facts; or
•  the transaction is determined to have been
fair as to the corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the
board of directors, a committee thereof or
the shareholders.
An interested director must disclose to the
company the nature and extent of any
interest in a transaction with the company,
or one of its subsidiaries, which to a material
extent conflicts or may conflict with the
interests of the company and of which the
director is aware. Failure to disclose an
interest entitles the company or a
shareholder to apply to the court for an
order setting aside the transaction
concerned and directing that the director
account to the company for any profit.
A transaction is not voidable and a director
is not accountable notwithstanding a failure
to disclose an interest if the transaction is
confirmed by special resolution and the
nature and extent of the director’s interest in
the transaction are disclosed in reasonable
detail in the notice calling the meeting at
which the resolution is passed.
Although it may still order that a director
account for any profit, a
299
Table of Contents
Alkuri
Babylon
court will not set aside a transaction unless
it is satisfied that the interests of third
parties who have acted in good faith would
not thereby be unfairly prejudiced and the
transaction was not reasonable and fair in
the interests of the company at the time it
was entered into.
Under the Babylon Articles, a director shall
not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a
meeting) in respect of any resolution
concerning that director’s own appointment
or termination, and may not vote (or be
counted in the quorum at a meeting) in
respect of any resolution relating to a
transaction or arrangement of the company
in which that director has an interests which
may reasonably be regarded as likely to give
rise to a conflict of interest, subject only to
certain exceptions (including that the
resolutions concerns a transaction or
arrangement in which the director is
interested by virtue of an interest in shares,
debentures or other securities of the
company or otherwise in or through the
company).
Business Combinations and Asset Sales
With certain exceptions, a merger, consolidation,
or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Delaware corporation must be approved by the
board of directors and a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.
The Jersey Companies Law allows for the
merger of two companies into either one
consolidated company or one company
merged into another so as to form a single
surviving company. The merger or
consolidation of two or more companies
under the Jersey Companies Law requires
the directors of the constituent companies
to enter into and to approve a written
merger agreement, which must also be
authorized by a special resolution of the
shareholders of each constituent company
(which as noted above requires the
affirmative vote of no less than
300
Table of Contents
Alkuri
Babylon
two-thirds of the votes cast at a quorate
general meeting (or such higher threshold
as may be set out in a company’s articles of
association)). In relation to any merger or
consolidation under the Jersey Companies
Law, unlike dissenting shareholders of a
Delaware corporation, dissenting
shareholders of a Jersey company have no
appraisal rights that would provide the right
to receive payment in cash for the judicially
determined fair value of the shares.
However, under Jersey law, dissenting
shareholders may object to the Court on the
grounds they are unfairly prejudiced by the
merger.
The Jersey Companies Law provides that
where a person has made an offer to acquire
a class or all of the company’s outstanding
shares not already held by the person and
has as a result of such offer acquired or
contractually agreed to acquire 90% or more
of such outstanding shares, that person is
then entitled (and may be required) to
acquire the remaining shares. In such
circumstances, a holder of any such
remaining shares may apply to the courts of
Jersey for an order that the person making
such offer not be entitled to purchase the
holder’s shares or that the person purchase
the holder’s shares on terms different than
those under which the person made such
offer.
In addition, where the company and its
creditors or shareholders or a class of either
of them propose a compromise or
arrangement between the company and its
creditors or our shareholders or a class of
either of them (as applicable), the courts of
Jersey may order a meeting of the creditors
or class of creditors or of

the company’s shareholders or class of
shareholders (as applicable) to be called in
such a manner as the court directs. Any
compromise or arrangement approved by a
majority in number representing 75% or
more in value of the creditors or 75% or
more of the voting rights of shareholders or
class of either of them (as applicable) if
sanctioned by the court, is binding upon
the company and all the creditors,
shareholders or members of the specific
class of either of them (as applicable).
Whether the capital of the company is to be
treated as being divided into a single or
multiple class(es) of shares is a matter to be
determined by the court. The court may in
its discretion treat a single class of shares
as multiple classes, or multiple classes of
shares as a single class, for the purposes of
the shareholder approval referred to above,
taking into account all relevant
circumstances, which may include
circumstances other than the rights
attaching to the shares themselves.
The Jersey Companies Law contains no
specific restrictions on the powers of
directors to dispose of assets of a company.
As a matter of general law, in the exercise of
those powers, the directors must discharge
their duties of care and act in good faith, for
a proper purpose and in the interests of the
company.
Size of Board; Election and Removal of Directors
The Alkuri bylaws provide that the number of
directors shall be fixed by a resolution of the
board of directors.
Each director’s term continues until the election
and qualification of their successor, or their
earlier death, resignation, or removal.

quorum, or by a sole remaining director and shall
not be filled by the stockholders, and such
director so chosen shall hold office until the next
election of the class for which such director was
chosen and until his successor shall be elected

Under the Alkuri bylaws, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time,
but only for cause and only by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of capital
stock of Alkuri entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, voting together as a single
class.
Fiduciary Duties of Directors
Under the DGCL, a director of a Delaware
corporation has a fiduciary duty to the
corporation and its shareholders. This duty has
two components, the duty of care and the duty
of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a
director act in good faith, with the care that an
ordinarily prudent person would exercise under
similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director
must inform himself of, and disclose to
shareholders, all material information reasonably
available regarding a significant transaction. The
duty of loyalty requires that a director must act
in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be
in the best interests of the corporation. A
director must not use his or her corporate
Under the Jersey Companies Law, a director
of a Jersey company, in exercising the
director’s powers and discharging the
director’s duties, has a fiduciary duty to act
honestly and in good faith with a view to
the best interests of the company; and a
duty of care to exercise the care, diligence
and skill that a reasonably prudent person
would exercise in comparable
circumstances.
Customary law is also an important source
of law in the area of directors’ duties in
Jersey as it expands upon and provides a
more detailed understanding of the general
duties and obligations of directors. The
Jersey courts view English common law as
highly

position for personal gain or advantage. This
duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and
mandates that the best interests of the
corporation and its shareholders take
precedence over any interest possessed by a
director, officer or controlling shareholder and
not shared by the shareholders generally. In
general, actions of a director are presumed to
have been made on an informed basis, in good
faith and in the honest belief that the action
taken was in the best interests of the
corporation. However, this presumption may be
rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the
fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be
presented concerning a transaction by a director,
the director must prove the procedural fairness
of the transaction and that the transaction was
of fair value to the corporation.
persuasive in this area. In summary, the
following duties will apply as manifestations
of the general fiduciary duty under the
Jersey Companies Law: a duty to act in
good faith and in what he or she bona fide
considers to be the best interests of the
company; a duty to exercise powers for a
proper purpose; a duty to avoid any actual
or potential conflict between his or her own
and the company’s interests; and a duty to
account for profits and not take personal
profit from any opportunities arising from
his or her directorship, even if he or she is
acting honestly and for the good of the
company. However, the articles of
association of a company may permit the
director to be personally interested in
arrangements involving the company
(subject to the requirement to have
disclosed such interest).
Under the Babylon Articles, certain
provisions apply in respect of the interests
of directors and their ability to participate in
relevant quorums and vote on resolutions in
respect of matters in which they are
interested—see “Description of Babylon’s
Share Capital and Articles of Association
—Directors’ Conflicts of Interest.” See, in
addition “Interested Director Transactions”

Exclusive Forum
The SPAC Charter provides, that unless Alkuri
consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for
any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of Alkuri; any action asserting a breach of
fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim

vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or

state). The exclusive forum provision would
not prevent derivative shareholder actions
based on claims arising under U.S. federal
securities laws from being raised in a U.S.
court and would not prevent a U.S. court
from asserting jurisdiction over such claims.
In addition, unless the company consents in
writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, U.S federal district courts shall be the
sole and exclusive form for any resolution of
any complaint asserting a cause of action

Limitations on Director’s Liability and
Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Under the SPAC Charter, directors shall not be
liable to Alkuri for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exculpation from liability is
prohibited by the DGCL.
Alkuri has indemnified, to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, any person from all
liabilities and expenses incurred by him or her by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director,
officer, employee or agent of Alkuri, or is or was
serving at the request of Alkuri as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another entity.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Babylon Articles provide that the directors
and officers of Babylon shall be indemnified
out of the assets of the company out of any
liability incurred by them for negligence,
default, breach of duty, breach of trust or
otherwise in relation to the affairs of the
company. In addition, the Babylon Articles
permit the board to purchase and maintain
insurance for such individuals.

with either (i) the consent in writing of the
holders of at least three quarters in nominal
value of the issued shares (of that class) or

passed at a separate general meeting of the
holders of those shares.
Appraisal Rights
A shareholder of a Delaware corporation
participating in certain major corporate
transactions may, under certain circumstances,
be entitled to appraisal rights under which the
shareholder may receive cash in the amount of
the fair value of the shares held by that
shareholder (as determined by a court) in lieu of
the consideration the shareholder would
otherwise receive in the transaction
In relation to any merger or consolidation
under the Jersey Companies Law, unlike
dissenting shareholders of a Delaware
corporation, dissenting shareholders of a
Jersey company have no appraisal rights
that would provide the right to receive
payment in cash for the judicially
determined fair value of the shares.
However, under Jersey law, dissenting
shareholders may object to the Court on the
grounds they are unfairly prejudiced by the
merger and the Court’s powers extend to
specifying terms of acquisition different
from those of the offer (which could include
terms as to price or form of consideration).
Shareholder Suits
Class actions and derivative actions generally
are available to the shareholders of a Delaware
corporation for, among other things, breach of
fiduciary duty, corporate waste, and actions not
taken in accordance with applicable law. In such
actions, the court has discretion to permit the
winning party to recover attorneys’ fees incurred
in connection with such action.
Under Article 141 of the Jersey Companies
Law, a shareholder may apply to court for
relief on the ground that the conduct of a
company’s affairs, including a proposed or
actual act or omission by a company, is
“unfairly prejudicial” to the interests of
shareholders generally or of some part of
shareholders, including at a minimum the
shareholder making the application.

may make an order regulating the affairs of a
company, requiring a company to refrain
from doing or continuing to do an act
complained of, authorizing civil proceedings
and providing for the purchase of shares by
a company or by any of its other
shareholders. There may be customary
personal law actions available to
shareholders which would include certain
derivate and other actions to bring
proceedings against the directors of the
company as well as the company.
In principle, Babylon will normally be the
proper plaintiff and a class action or
derivative
action may not be brought by a minority
shareholder. However, a minority
shareholder can seek in limited
circumstances agreement from the court for
special dispensation if the shareholder can
show:
•  that there are wrongdoers in control of
the company;
•  those wrongdoers are using their
power to prevent appropriate action
being taken in respect of such
wrongdoing;
•  the wrongdoing is unconscionable and
oppressive; and
•  in certain other limited circumstances.
Inspection of Books and Records
All shareholders of a Delaware corporation have
the right, upon written demand, to inspect or
obtain copies of the corporation’s shares ledger
and its other books and records for any purpose
reasonably related to such person’s interest as a
shareholder.
Shareholders of Babylon will have the right
under the Jersey Companies Law to inspect
Babylon’s register of shareholders and,
provided certain conditions are met, to
obtain a copy. Shareholders of Babylon will

without charge and, in the case of a public
company or a company which is a

any), not exceeding £5, as the company may
require.
Amendments of Governing Documents
Pursuant to the DGCL, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of
Alkuri Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is
required to amend, alter, or repeal provisions of
the SPAC Charter, subject to any additional vote
required therein. In addition, for so long as any
shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock shall
remain outstanding, the, affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Alkuri
Class B Common Stock outstanding, voting
separately as a single class, shall be required to
amend, alter or repeal any provision of the SPAC
Charter, in a manner that would alter or change
the powers, preferences or relative, participating,
optional or other or special rights of the Alkuri
Class B Common Stock; and the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 65% of all outstanding
shares of Alkuri Common Stock, shall be
required to amend Article Nine during the period
commencing upon the effectiveness of the SPAC
Charter and the consummation of the initial
Business Combination (as such term is used in
the SPAC Charter).
The memorandum of association and
articles of association of a Jersey company
may only be amended by special resolution
(being in the case of the Babylon Articles,
not less than 75% (or such higher majority
as specified in the same)) passed by
shareholders in general meeting or by
written resolution (noting the limitations
and additional requirements of written
resolutions, as described in “Description of
Babylon’s Share Capital and Articles of
Association—Action by Written Consent”)
passed in accordance with its articles of
association.

Subject to any additional vote required by the
SPAC Charter, the board of directors is expressly
authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Alkuri
bylaws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
power shall not divest or limit the power of the
stockholders of Alkuri to adopt, amend or repeal
the Alkuri bylaws.
Classified Board
A classified board is permitted under the DGCL.
The Alkuri bylaws do not currently provide for a
classified board of directors.
The Babylon Articles do not currently
provide for split classes of directors. Jersey
law does not specify the manner in which
directors may be appointed, removed or
otherwise classified, and so a Jersey
company’s articles of association may
provide that directors be divided into
classes with such term of office as may be
specified therein.
Dissolution and Winding Up
Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of
the holders of outstanding shares of preferred
stock, the SPAC Charter provides that following
the payment or provision of payment of the
debts and other liabilities of Alkuri in the event
of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of Alkuri, the holders
of Alkuri Class A Common Stock shall be entitled
to receive all of the remaining assets of Alkuri
available for distribution to Alkuri Stockholders,
ratably in proportion to the number of shares of
Alkuri Class A Common Stock held by them.
Under the Jersey Companies Law and the
Babylon Articles, Babylon may be
voluntarily dissolved, liquidated or wound
up by a special resolution of the
shareholders. In addition, in limited
circumstances, a company may be wound
up by the courts of Jersey if the court is of
the opinion that it is just and equitable to do
so or that it is expedient in the public
interest to do so.
Alternatively, a creditor with a claim against
a Jersey company of not less than £3,000
may apply to the Royal Court of Jersey for
the property of that company to be declared
en désastre (being the Jersey law equivalent
of a declaration of bankruptcy). Such an
application may also be made by the Jersey
company itself without having to obtain any
shareholder approval.

Beneficial Ownership of Babylon Shares Following the Business Combination
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Class B Shares immediately
before the Closing after effecting the Reclassification and immediately following the Closing by:
•
each person who is expected by Babylon to be the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the outstanding Babylon Class A Shares immediately
following the consummation of the Business Combination;
•
each person who is expected to become an executive officer or a director of Babylon upon consummation of the Business Combination; and
•
all of the executive officers and directors of Babylon as a group upon consummation of the Business Combination.
Beneficial ownership for the purposes of the following table is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. A person is a
“beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares “voting power,” which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of the security, or
“investment power,” which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of the security or has the right to acquire such powers within 60
days. Unless otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property laws, Babylon believes that all persons named in the table have sole
voting and investment power with respect to all Babylon Class A Shares beneficially owned by them.
The pre-Business Combination beneficial ownership assumes that Babylon effects the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of
Babylon Holdings is reclassified into Babylon Class A Shares, other than the Babylon Holdings Class A Shares, which are reclassified as Babylon Class
B Shares, and is based on 295,589,531 Babylon Holdings Class A Shares, 40,837,576 Babylon Holdings Class B Shares, in each case as of August 31,
2021.
The expected beneficial ownership of shares of Babylon Shares post-Business Combination assumes two scenarios:
•
SCENARIO A – in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, a “no redemption” scenario where (a) no shares of Alkuri
Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, and (b) Babylon Holdings issues shares of
Babylon Class A Shares as the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including the Stockholder Earnout Shares, the
Alkuri Public Shares and the Sponsor Shares; and
•
SCENARIO B – in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, a “redemption” scenario where, after giving effect to each of
the events in Scenario A, all 34,500,000 Alkuri Public Shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination.
Based on the foregoing assumptions, and including the 23,000,000 shares of Babylon Class A Shares to be issued in connection with the PIPE
Investment, we estimate that there would be 361,714,531 shares of Babylon Class A Shares and 79,637,576 shares of Babylon Class B Shares issued and
outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination in the “no redemption” scenario, and 327,214,531 shares of Babylon
Class A Shares and 79,637,576 Babylon Class B Shares issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination in
the “redemption” scenario. If the actual facts are different from the foregoing assumptions, ownership figures in Babylon and the columns under Post-
Business Combination in the table that follows will be different. In either Scenario A or Scenario B, each shareholder of Babylon that will control 10% or
more of the voting power in Babylon following the consummation of the Business Combination was also a shareholder of Babylon Holdings that
controlled 10% or more of the voting power in Babylon Holdings prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. The following table does
311Table of Contents
not reflect record of beneficial ownership of any Babylon Shares issuable upon exercise of public warrants or private placement warrants, as such
securities are not exercisable or convertible within 60 days of August 31, 2021. The following table also does not reflect the potential issuance of up to 6.4
million Class A
shares to shareholders of Higi.
Additionally, Nedgroup Private Wealth Fiduciary Services Limited, Nedgroup Trust (Jersey) Limited, ALP Partners Limited, the Parsa Family
Foundation and Dr. Parsadoust have informed Babyon that, following the consummation of the Business Combination, ALP Partners Limited and the
Parsa Family Foundation are considering executing certain re-organizational transactions (the “Founder Reorganization Transactions”), a of which are
expected to result in Dr. Parsadoust holding voting and investment control over the Babylon Shares currently held of record by ALP Partners Limited and
the Parsa Family Foundation. As a result, following the Founder Reorganization Transactions, Dr. Parsadoust and his spouse may be deemed to
beneficially own such shares. As the Founder Reorganization Transactions are not certain, the following table does not give effect to the Founder
Reorganization Transactions.
Unless otherwise indicated, Babylon believes that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the
voting securities beneficially owned by them.

The consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the years
in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, have been included in this proxy statement/prospectus in reliance upon the report of KPMG LLP (United
Kingdom) (“KPMG”), independent registered public accounting firm, appearing elsewhere herein and upon the authority of said firm as experts in
accounting and auditing.
KPMG audited the consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings Limited for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and were in
compliance with the independence requirements of the United Kingdom (the Financial Reporting Council’s (“FRC”) Ethical Standard and the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics (“IESBA”)) for such periods and when the respective audit reports included in this proxy
statement/prospectus were issued. In addition, for 2020, KPMG was required to be independent under SEC and PCAOB independence Rules and
Regulations. However, during 2020, one of KPMG’s affiliates, referred to as a KPMG member firm, provided non-audit services pursuant to an
engagement between an upstream controlling affiliate of Babylon Holdings and that KPMG member firm. This related to the delivery of a service that
consisted of a legal service and a management function, to an upstream affiliate of Babylon Holdings that was impermissible when evaluated under the
auditor independence standards of Regulation S-X and of the PCAOB. The KPMG member firm that engaged in delivery of this service did not include
KPMG U.K. or any of its staff and did not provide any audit services to Babylon Holdings. Under local and IESBA rules this service was permissible.
This impermissible non-audit service was related to a legal service and a management function on the structure of a property investment by an
upstream affiliate of Babylon Holdings and did not relate to the core group business activities that will be included in Babylon Holdings’ consolidated
financial statements. None of the deliverables under the service will be subject to audit procedures performed by KPMG U.K. as part of Babylon
Holdings’ audit, and the service had no impact on the internal control over financial reporting of Babylon Holdings. Together, the KPMG member firm
earned fees of approximately 17,000 Euro ($19,000 USD equivalent) in 2020 in relation to this non-audit service. These fees were insignificant to the
business of the relevant KPMG member firm providing the service as well as to Babylon. The management of the upstream affiliate of Babylon Holdings
Limited retained all decision making and ultimate responsibility for the service provided, and the service was completed and exited in September 2020.
The audit committee of the Babylon Holdings board of directors and KPMG have separately considered the impact that this impermissible non-
audit service may have had on KPMG’s objectivity and impartiality with respect to their audits of Babylon Holdings. Both the audit committee of the
Babylon Holdings board of directors and KPMG have concluded this non-audit service did not affect KPMG’s ability to exercise objective and impartial
judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagement performed by KPMG for the consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings for
the year ended December 31, 2020, and that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same
conclusion.
The financial statements of Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp. as of December 31, 2020 and for the period from December 1, 2020 (inception) through
December 31, 2020 appearing in this proxy statement/prospectus have been audited by Marcum LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
set forth in their report thereon, appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, and are included in reliance on the report of such firm given

Babylon is a company organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off
the coast of Normandy, France. Accordingly, you may have difficulty serving legal process within the United States upon Babylon. You may also have
difficulty enforcing, both in and outside the United States, judgments you may obtain in U.S. courts against Babylon in any action, including actions
based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. Furthermore, there is doubt that Jersey courts would enter judgments in
original actions brought in those courts predicated on U.S. federal or state securities laws. However, Babylon may be served with process in the United
States with respect to actions against Babylon arising out of or in connection with violation of U.S. federal securities laws relating to offers and sales of
Babylon’s securities by serving Babylon’s U.S. agent irrevocably appointed for that purpose.

of the Company which to a material extent conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the Company and of which such director is aware, shall
disclose to the Company the nature and extent of such director’s interest.
80.
Provisions applicable to declarations of interest
For the purposes of article 79:
(a)
the disclosure shall be made at the first meeting of the directors at which the transaction is considered after the director concerned becomes
aware of the circumstances giving rise to such director’s duty to make it or, if for any reason the director fails to do so at such meeting, as
soon as practical after the meeting, by notice in writing delivered to the secretary;
(b)
the secretary, where the disclosure is made to shall inform the directors that it has been made and shall in any event table the notice of the
disclosure at the next meeting after it is made;
(c)
a disclosure to the Company by a director in accordance with article 80(a) above that such director is to be regarded as interested in a
transaction with a specified person is sufficient disclosure of that director’s interest in any such transaction entered into after the disclosure
is made; and
(d)
any disclosure made at a meeting of the directors shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.
81.
Directors’ interests and voting
(a)
Subject to the Statutes and to declaring any interest or interests in accordance with articles 79 and 80, a director may:

enter into or be interested in any transaction or arrangement with the Company, either with regard to the director’s tenure of any
office or position in the management, administration or conduct of the business of the Company or as vendor, purchaser or otherwise;
(ii)
hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of auditor) in conjunction with the director’s office of director
for such period (subject to the Statutes) and upon such terms as the Board may decide and be paid such extra remuneration for so
doing (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profits or otherwise) as the Board may decide, either in addition to or in
lieu of any remuneration under any other provision of these articles;
(iii)
act personally or by the director’s firm in a professional capacity for the Company (except as auditor) and be entitled to remuneration
for professional services as if the director were not a director;

company or subsidiary undertaking of that holding
B-38
Table of Contents
company or any other company in which the Company may be interested. The Board may cause the voting rights conferred by the
shares in any other company held or owned by the Company or exercisable by them as directors of that other company to be
exercised in such manner in all respects as it thinks fit (including the exercise of voting rights in favour of any resolution appointing
the directors or any of them as directors or officers of the other company or voting or providing for the payment of any benefit to the
directors or officers of the other company); and
(v)
be or become a director, manager or employee of, or a consultant to, or acquire or retain any direct or indirect interest in, any entity
(whether or not a body corporate) in which the Company does not have an interest if that cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to
give rise to a conflict of interest at the time of the director’s appointment as a director of that other company.
(b)
A director shall not, by reason of holding office as director (or of the fiduciary relationship established by holding that office), be liable to
account to the Company for any remuneration, profit or other benefit resulting from any interest permitted under paragraph (a) above and
no contract shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any director having any type of interest permitted under paragraph (a) above.
(c)
A director shall not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting) in respect of any resolution concerning that director’s own appointment
(including fixing or varying its terms), or the termination of that director’s own appointment, as the holder of any office or place of profit
with the Company or any other company in which the Company is interested but, where proposals are under consideration concerning the
appointment (including fixing or varying its terms), or the termination of the appointment, of two or more directors to offices or places of
profit with the Company or any other company in which the Company is interested, those proposals may be divided and a separate
resolution may be put in relation to each director and in that case each of the directors concerned (if not otherwise debarred from voting
under this article) shall be entitled to vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution unless it concerns that director’s
own appointment or the termination of that director’s own appointment.
(d)
A director shall also not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting) in relation to any resolution relating to any transaction or
arrangement with the Company in which the director has an interest which may reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of
interest and, if the director purports to do so, the director’s vote shall not be counted, but this prohibition shall not apply and a director may
vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of any resolution concerning any one or more of the following matters:
(i)
any transaction or arrangement in which the director is interested by virtue of an interest in shares, debentures or other securities of
the Company or otherwise in or through the Company;
(ii)
the giving of any guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of:
(A)
money lent or obligations incurred by the director or by any other person at the request of, or for the benefit of, the Company
or any of its subsidiary undertakings; or
(B)
a debt or obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which the director personally has assumed
responsibility in whole or in part (either alone or jointly with others) under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of
security;
(iii)
indemnification (including loans made in connection with it) by the Company in relation to the performance of the director’s duties on
behalf of the Company or of any of its subsidiary undertakings;
(iv)
any issue or offer of shares, debentures or other securities of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings in respect of which
the director is or may be entitled to participate in the director’s capacity as a holder of any such securities or as an underwriter or sub-
underwriter;
B-39
Table of Contents
(v)
any transaction or arrangement concerning any other company in which the director does not hold, directly or indirectly as
shareholder voting rights representing one per cent. or more of any class of shares in the capital of that company;
(vi)
any arrangement for the benefit of employees of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings which does not accord to the
director any privilege or benefit not generally accorded to the employees to whom the arrangement relates; and
(vii)
the purchase or maintenance of insurance for the benefit of directors or for the benefit of persons including directors.
(e)
If any question arises at any meeting as to whether an interest of a director (other than the chair of the meeting) may reasonably be regarded
as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest or as to the entitlement of any director (other than the chair of the meeting) to vote in relation to
a transaction or arrangement with the Company and the question is not resolved by the director voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting,
the question shall be referred to the chair of the meeting and the chair’s ruling in relation to the director concerned shall be final and
conclusive except in a case where the nature or extent of the interest of the director concerned, so far as known to the director concerned,
has not been fairly disclosed. If any question shall arise in respect of the chair of the meeting and is not resolved by the chair voluntarily
agreeing to abstain from voting, the question shall be decided by a resolution of the Board (for which purpose the chair shall be counted in
the quorum but shall not vote on the matter) and the resolution shall be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature or extent of
the interest of the chair of the meeting, so far as known to the chair, has not been fairly disclosed.
(f)
Subject to the Statutes, the Company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax the provisions of this article to any extent or ratify any
transaction or arrangement not duly authorised by reason of a contravention of this article.
82.
No duty of confidentiality to another person; waiver of corporate opportunity
(a)
A director shall be under no duty to the Company with respect to any information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a
director of the Company and in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to another person. In particular, the director shall not be
in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company because he fails:
(i)
to disclose any such information to the Board or to any director or other officer or employee of the Company; and/or
(ii)
to use or apply any such information in performing his duties as a director of the Company.
(b)
Where the existence of a director’s relationship with another person gives rise to a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest, the
director shall not be in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company because he:
(i)
absents himself from meetings of the Board at which any matter relating to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest will or
may be discussed or from the discussion of any such matter at a meeting or otherwise; and/or
(ii)
makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to any matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest or
possible conflict of interest sent or supplied by the Company and/or for such documents and information to be received and read by
a professional adviser,
for so long as he reasonably believes such conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest subsists.
(c)
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company hereby agrees that no director (excluding the Founder) (a relevant director) shall have
any obligation to refrain from engaging, directly or
B-40
Table of Contents
indirectly and whether or not by or through his affiliates, in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as the Company or
any of its subsidiaries. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any
interest or expectancy of the Company and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities
that are from time to time available to any relevant director or his affiliates, even if the opportunity is one that the Company or its
subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. The
Company hereby further agrees that no relevant director shall have any duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to the
Company (and that there shall be no restriction on any relevant director or any of his affiliates using the general knowledge and
understanding of the Company and the industry in which the Company operates that such relevant director has gained from occupying the
position of a director) and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be liable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
shareholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty as a director solely by reason of the fact that the relevant director or his affiliates
pursue or acquire such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business
opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to the Company or its subsidiaries, or uses such knowledge and
understanding in the manner described herein.
(d)
For the purposes of paragraph (c) above and article 11(c), an affiliate of a relevant director means an entity (whether or not a body
corporate) of which the relevant director is a director, manager or employee, or to which the relevant director is a consultant, or in which the
relevant director has any direct or indirect interest (an affiliated entity), and any other entity (whether or not a body corporate) in which an
affiliated entity of the relevant director has any direct or indirect interest, but in each case excluding the Company and its subsidiaries.
(e)
The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above are without prejudice to any equitable principle or rule of law which may excuse the
director from:
(i)
disclosing information, in circumstances where disclosure would otherwise be required under these articles; or
(ii)
attending meetings or discussions or receiving documents and information as referred to in paragraph (b) above, in circumstances
where such attendance or receiving such documents and information would otherwise be required under these articles or the law.

known address). A director may waive notice of any meeting either prospectively or retrospectively and any retrospective waiver shall not affect
the validity of the meeting or of any business conducted at the meeting.

A resolution passed at any meeting held in the above manner, and signed by the chair of the meeting, shall be as valid and effectual as if it
had been passed at a meeting of the Board (or committee of the Board, as the case may be) duly convened and held.
90.
Resolutions without meetings
A resolution which is signed or approved by all the directors entitled to vote on that resolution (and whose vote would have been counted) shall
be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a board meeting duly called and constituted. The resolution may be contained in one document
or communication in electronic form or in several documents or communications in electronic form (in like form), each signed or approved by one or
more of the directors concerned. For the purpose of this article the approval of a director shall be given in hard copy form or in electronic form.
B-42
Table of Contents
91.
Validity of acts of directors in spite of formal defect
All acts bona fide done by a meeting of the Board, or of a committee, or by any person acting as a director or a member of a committee, shall,
notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any member of the Board or committee or of the
person so acting, or that they or any of them were disqualified or had vacated office or were not entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person
had been duly appointed and qualified to be a director and had continued to be a director or member of the committee and had been entitled to
vote.

(a)
A person whose name is entered in the register as the holder of any certificated shares shall be entitled (unless the conditions of issue
otherwise provide) within the time limits prescribed by the Statutes to receive one certificate for those shares, or one certificate for each
class of those shares and, if that person transfers part of the shares represented by a certificate in that person’s name, or elects to hold part
in uncertificated form, to receive a new certificate for the balance of those shares, provided in all cases that there shall be no requirement to
issue any certificate to Cede & Co. in respect of any shares held by it.
(b)
In the case of joint holders, the Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for all the shares in any particular class
registered in their joint names, and delivery of a certificate for a share to any one of the joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all.
(c)
A share certificate shall be issued under seal or signed by at least one director and the secretary or by at least two directors (which may
include any signature being applied mechanically or electronically). A share certificate shall specify the number and class of the shares to
which it relates and the amount or respective amounts paid up on the shares and (where required by the Statutes), the distinguishing
numbers of such shares. Any certificate so issued shall, as against the Company, be prima facie evidence of title of the person named in that
certificate to the shares comprised in it.

B-43
Table of Contents
95.

Except as expressly provided to the contrary in these articles, no fee shall be charged for the issue of a share certificate.
(b)
Any two or more certificates representing shares of any one class held by any member may at the member’s request be cancelled and a
single new certificate issued.
(c)
If any member surrenders for cancellation a certificate representing shares held by that member and requests the Company to issue two or
more certificates representing those shares in such proportions as that member may specify, the Board may, if it thinks fit, comply with the
request on payment of such fee (if any) as the Board may decide.
(d)
If a certificate is damaged or defaced or alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, a new certificate representing the same shares may
be issued on compliance with such conditions as to evidence, indemnity and security for such indemnity as the Board may think fit and on
payment of any exceptional expenses of the Company incidental to its investigation of the evidence and preparation of the indemnity and
security and, if damaged or defaced, on delivery up of the old certificate.
(e)
In the case of joint holders of a share a request for a new certificate under any of the preceding paragraphs of this article may be made by
any one of the joint holders unless the certificate is alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
LIEN ON SHARES
96.
Lien on partly paid shares
(a)
The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all amounts payable (whether or not
due) in respect of that share. The lien shall extend to every amount payable in respect of that share.
(b)
The Board may at any time either generally or in any particular case declare any share to be wholly or partly exempt from this article. Unless
otherwise agreed, the registration of a transfer of a share shall operate as a waiver of the Company’s lien (if any) on that share.
97.
Enforcement of lien
(a)
The Company may sell any share subject to a lien in such manner as the Board may decide if an amount payable on the share is due and is
not paid within 14 clear days after a notice has been given to the holder or any person entitled by transmission to the share demanding
payment of that amount and giving notice of intention to sell in default.
(b)
To give effect to any sale under this article, the Board may authorise some person to transfer the share sold to, or as directed by, the
purchaser. The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall the title of the new holder to the
share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings relating to the sale.
(c)
The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs of such sale, shall be applied in or towards satisfaction of the amount due and any
residue shall (subject to a like lien for any amounts not presently due as existed on the share before the sale), on surrender, in the case of
shares held in certificated form, of the certificate for the shares sold, be paid to the holder or person entitled by transmission to the share
immediately before the sale.

CALLS ON SHARES
98.
Calls
(a)
Subject to the terms of these articles and the terms of which the shares are allotted, the Board may make calls on the members in respect of
any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether in respect of nominal amount or premium) and not payable on a date fixed by or in accordance
with the terms of issue. Each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 clear days’ notice specifying when and where payment is to be
made) pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on the member’s shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the
Board may decide.
(b)
Any call may be made payable in one sum or by instalments and shall be deemed to be made at the time when the resolution of the Board
authorising that call is passed.
(c)
A person on whom a call is made shall remain liable for it notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the share in respect of which the call is
made.
(d)
The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of all calls in respect of that share.
99.
Interest on calls
If a call is not paid before or on the due date for payment, the person from whom it is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid, from the due
date for payment to the date of actual payment, at such rate as the Board may decide, but the Board may waive payment of the interest, wholly or in
part.
100. Sums treated as calls
A sum which by the terms of allotment of a share is payable on allotment, or at a fixed time, or by instalments at fixed times, whether in respect of
nominal value or premium, shall for all purposes of these articles be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date or dates fixed for
payment and, in case of non-payment, these articles shall apply as if that sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call.
101. Power to differentiate
On any allotment of shares the Board may make arrangements for a difference between the allottees or holders of the shares in the amounts and
times of payment of calls on their shares.
102. Payment of calls in advance
The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive all or any part of the moneys payable on a share beyond the sum actually called up on it if the holder is
willing to make payment in advance and, on any moneys so paid in advance, may (until they would otherwise be due) pay interest at such rate as
may be agreed between the Board and the member paying the sum in advance.
FORFEITURE OF SHARES
103. Notice of unpaid calls
(a)
If the whole or any part of any call or instalment remains unpaid on any share after the due date for payment, the Board may give a notice to
the holder requiring the holder to pay so much of the call or instalment as remains unpaid, together with any accrued interest.
B-45
Table of Contents
(b)
The notice shall state a further day, being not less than 14 clear days from the date of the notice, on or before which, and the place where,
payment is to be made and shall state that, in the event of non-payment on or before the day and at the place appointed, the share in
respect of which the call was made or instalment is payable will be liable to be forfeited.
(c)
The Board may accept a surrender of any share liable to be forfeited.
104. Forfeiture on non-compliance with notice
(a)
If the requirements of a notice given under article 103 are not complied with, any share in respect of which it was given may at any time
thereafter (before the payment required by the notice is made) be forfeited by a resolution of the Board. The forfeiture shall include all
dividends declared and other moneys payable in respect of the forfeited share and not actually paid before the forfeiture.
(b)
If a share is forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be given to the person who was the holder of the share or (as the case may be) the person
entitled to the share by transmission, and an entry that notice of the forfeiture has been given, with the relevant date, shall be made in the
register; but no forfeiture shall be invalidated by any omission to give such notice or to make such entry.
105. Power to annul forfeiture or surrender
The Board may, at any time before the forfeited or surrendered share has been sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, annul the forfeiture or
surrender upon payment of all calls and interest due on or incurred in respect of the share and on such further conditions (if any) as it thinks fit.
106. Disposal of forfeited or surrendered shares
(a)
Every share which is forfeited or surrendered shall become the property of the Company and (subject to the Statutes) may be sold, re-
allotted or otherwise disposed of, upon such terms and in such manner as the Board shall decide either to the person who was before the
forfeiture the holder of the share or to any other person and whether with or without all or any part of the amount previously paid up on the
share being credited as so paid up. The Board may for the purposes of a disposal authorise some person to transfer the forfeited or
surrendered share to, or in accordance with the directions of, any person to whom the same has been disposed of.
(b)
A statutory declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been forfeited or surrendered on a specified date shall, as against all
persons claiming to be entitled to the share, be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it and shall (subject to the execution of any
necessary transfer) constitute a good title to the share. The person to whom the share has been disposed of shall not be bound to see to
the application of the consideration for the disposal (if any) nor shall that person’s title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or
invalidity of the proceedings connected with the forfeiture, surrender, sale, re-allotment or disposal of the share.
107. Arrears to be paid notwithstanding forfeiture or surrender
A person any of whose shares have been forfeited or surrendered shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited or surrendered share and
shall, in the case of shares held in certificated form, surrender to the Company for cancellation any certificate for the share forfeited or surrendered,
but shall remain liable (unless payment is waived in whole or in part by the Board) to pay to the Company all moneys payable by that person on or
in respect of that share at the time of forfeiture or surrender, together with interest from the time of forfeiture or surrender until payment at such rate
as the Board shall decide, in the same manner as if the share had not been forfeited or surrendered. The Board may waive payment of interest
wholly or in party and may enforce payment, without any reduction or allowance for the value of the shares at the time of
B-46
Table of Contents
forfeiture or for any consideration received on their disposal. Such a person shall also be liable to satisfy all the claims and demands (if any) which
the Company might have enforced in respect of the share at the time of forfeiture or surrender. No deduction or allowance shall be made for the
value of the share at the time of forfeiture or surrender or for any consideration received on its disposal.
SEAL
108. Seal
(a)
The Company may exercise the powers conferred by the Statutes with regard to having official seals and those powers shall be vested in
the Board.
(b)
The Board shall provide for the safe custody of every seal of the Company.

A seal shall be used only by the authority of the Board or a duly authorised committee but that authority may consist of an instruction or
approval given in hard copy form or in electronic form by a majority of the directors or of the members of a duly authorised committee.
(d)
The Board may determine who shall sign any instrument to which a seal is applied, either generally or in relation to a particular instrument or
type of instrument, and may also determine, either generally or in any particular case, that such signatures shall be dispensed with or affixed
by some mechanical means.
(e)
Unless otherwise decided by the Board:
(i)
certificates for shares, debentures or other securities of the Company issued under seal need not be signed; and

109. Declaration of dividends by the Company
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the Company may, by ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be paid to the members, according
to their respective rights and interests in the profits, and may fix the time for payment of such dividend, but no dividend shall exceed the amount
recommended by the Board.
110. Fixed and interim dividends
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the Board may pay interim dividends and may also pay any dividend payable at a fixed rate at
intervals settled by the Board whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If the Board acts in
good faith, none of the directors shall incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss such holders may suffer in
consequence of the payment of an interim dividend on any shares having non-preferred or deferred rights.
111. Calculation and currency of dividends
(a)
Except insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share otherwise provide:
(i)
all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid, but
no amount paid up on a share in advance of calls shall be treated for the purposes of this article as paid up on the share;
B-47
Table of Contents
(ii)
all dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions
of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid; and
(iii)
dividends may be declared or paid in any currency.
(b)
The Board may agree with any member that dividends which may at any time or from time to time be declared or become due on that
member’s shares in one currency shall be paid or satisfied in another, and may agree the basis of conversion to be applied and how and
when the amount to be paid in the other currency shall be calculated and paid and for the Company or any other person to bear any costs
involved.
112. Method of payment
(a)
The Company may pay any dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share by such method as the Board may decide. The Board may
decide to use different methods of payment for different holders or groups of holders. Without limiting any other method of payment which
the Board may decide upon, the Board may decide that payment can be made, wholly or partly and exclusively or optionally:
(i)
by cheque or dividend warrant payable to the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, the holder whose name stands first in the register
in respect of the relevant share) or to such other person as the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, all the joint holders) may notify
to the Company for the purpose; or
(ii)
by a bank or other funds transfer system or by such other electronic means as the Board may decide (including, in the case of an
uncertificated share, a relevant system) to such account as the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, all the joint holders) may notify
to the Company for the purpose; or
(iii)
in such other way as may be agreed between the Company and the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, all such holders).
(b)
If the Board decides that any dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share will be made exclusively by one or more of the methods
referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) above to an account, but no such account is nominated by the holder (or, in case of joint holders, all the joint
holders) or if an attempted payment into a nominated account is rejected or refunded, the Company may treat that dividend or other sum
payable as unclaimed.
(c)
Any such cheque or dividend warrant may be sent by post to the registered address of the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, to the
registered address of that person whose name stands first in the register in respect of the relevant share) or to such other address as the
holder (or, in the case of joint holders, all the joint holders) may notify to the Company for the purpose.
(d)
Every cheque or warrant is sent, and payment in any other way is made, at the risk of the person or persons entitled to it and the Company
will not be responsible for any sum lost or delayed when it has sent or transmitted the sum in accordance with these articles. Clearance of a
cheque or warrant or transmission of funds through a bank or other funds transfer system or by such other electronic means as is permitted
by these articles shall be a good discharge to the Company.
(e)
Any joint holder or other person jointly entitled to any share may give an effective receipt for any dividend or other sum paid in respect of
the share.
(f)
Any dividend, distribution or other sum payable in respect of any share may be paid to a person or persons entitled by transmission to that
share as if that person or those persons were the holder or joint holders of that share and that person’s address (or the address of the first
named of two or more persons jointly entitled) noted in the register were the registered address.

113. Dividends not to bear interest
No dividend or other moneys payable by the Company on or in respect of any share shall bear interest as against the Company unless otherwise
provided by the rights attached to the share.
114. Calls or debts may be deducted from dividends
The Board may deduct from any dividend or other moneys payable to any person (either alone or jointly with another) on or in respect of a share all
such sums as may be due from that person (either alone or jointly with another) to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to
shares of the Company.
115. Unclaimed dividends etc.
(a)
All unclaimed dividends, interest or other sums payable may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board for the benefit of the Company
until claimed. All dividends and any other such monies unclaimed for a period of 10 years after having been declared shall be forfeited and cease to
remain owing by the Company.
(b)
If the Company exercises its power of sale in accordance with article 129, all dividends and other such monies payable on that share shall be
forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company.
(c)
The payment of any unclaimed dividend, interest or other sum payable by the Company on or in respect of any share into a separate account shall
not constitute the Company a trustee in respect of it.
116. Uncashed dividends
If:
(i)
a payment for a dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share sent by the Company to the person entitled to it in accordance
with these articles is left uncashed or is returned to the Company or a payment has failed (including where the payment has been
rejected or refunded) and, after reasonable enquiries, the Company is unable to establish any new address or, with respect to a
payment to be made by a funds transfer system, a new account, for that person; or
(ii)
such a payment is left uncashed or returned to the Company or fails (including where the payment has been rejected or refunded) on
two consecutive occasions,
the Company shall not be obliged to send any dividends or other sums payable in respect of that share to that person until that person notifies the
Company of an address or, where the payment is to be made by a funds transfer system, details of the account, to be used for the purpose.
117. Dividends in specie
(a)
With the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company and on the recommendation of the Board, payment of any dividend may be
satisfied wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of any other company.
(b)
Where any difficulty arises with the distribution, the Board may settle the difficulty as it thinks fit and, in particular, may issue fractional
certificates (or ignore fractions), fix the value for distribution of the specific assets or any part of them, determine that cash payments be
made to any members on the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution and vest any of the specific assets in
trustees on such trusts for the persons entitled to the dividend as the Board may think fit.
118. Scrip dividends
(a)
The Board may, with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company, offer any holders of any particular class of shares the right to
elect to receive further shares of that class, credited as fully paid,
B-49
Table of Contents
instead of cash in respect of all (or some part) of any dividend specified by the ordinary resolution (a scrip dividend) in accordance with the
following provisions of this article.
(b)
The ordinary resolution may specify a particular dividend (whether or not already declared) or may specify all or any dividends declared
within a specified period, but such period may not end later than five years after the date of the meeting at which the ordinary resolution is
passed.
(c)
The basis of allotment shall be decided by the Board so that, as nearly as may be considered convenient, the value of the further shares,
including any fractional entitlement, is equal to the amount of the cash dividend which would otherwise have been paid (disregarding the
amount of any associated tax credit).
(d)
For the purposes of paragraph (c) above the value of the further shares shall be:
(i)
equal to the final reported per share closing price as quoted for a fully paid share of the relevant class, as shown in the NASDAQ
Daily List for the day on which such shares are first quoted “ex” the relevant dividend and the four subsequent dealing days; or
(ii)
calculated in such manner as may be determined by or in accordance with the ordinary resolution.
(e)
The Board shall give notice to the holders of such shares of their rights of election in respect of the scrip dividend and shall specify the
procedure to be followed in order to make an election.
(f)
The dividend or that part of it in respect of which an election for the scrip dividend is made shall not be paid and instead further shares of
the relevant class shall be allotted in accordance with elections duly made and the Board shall capitalise a sum equal to the aggregate
nominal amount of the shares to be allotted out of such sums available for the purpose as the Board may consider appropriate.
(g)
The further shares so allotted shall rank pari passu in all respects with the fully paid shares of the same class then in issue except as regards
participation in the relevant dividend.
(h)
The Board may decide that the right to elect for any scrip dividend shall not be made available to members resident in any territory where, in
the opinion of the Board, compliance with local laws or regulations would be unduly onerous.
(i)
The Board may do all acts and things as it considers necessary or expedient to give effect to the provisions of a scrip dividend election and
the issue of any shares in accordance with the provisions of this article, and may make such provisions as it thinks fit for the case of shares
becoming distributable in fractions (including provisions under which, in whole or in part, the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to
the Company rather than to the members concerned). To the extent that the entitlement of any holder of shares in respect of any dividend is
less than the value of one new share of the relevant class (as determined for the basis of any scrip dividend) the Board may also from time
to time establish or vary a procedure for such entitlement to be accrued and aggregated with any similar entitlement for the purposes of any
subsequent scrip dividend.
(j)
The Board may from time to time establish or vary a procedure for election mandates, under which a holder of shares may, in respect of any
future dividends for which a right of election pursuant to this article is offered, elect to receive shares in lieu of such dividend on the terms
of such mandate.
(k)
The Board shall not make a scrip dividend available unless the Company has sufficient undistributed profits or reserves to give effect to
elections which could be made to receive that scrip dividend.
(l)
The Board may decide at any time before the further shares are allotted that such shares shall not be allotted and pay the relevant dividend
in cash instead. Such decision may be made before or after any election has been made by holders of shares in respect of the relevant
dividend.

CAPITALISATION OF RESERVES
119. Capitalisation of reserves
(a)
The Board may, with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company or, if required by the Companies Law, a special resolution:
(i)
subject to these articles, resolve to capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any reserve account of the Company (including share
premium account and capital redemption reserve) or any sum standing to the credit of profit and loss account not required for the
payment of any preferential dividend (whether or not it is available for distribution); and
(ii)
appropriate that sum as capital to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal amount of the ordinary share capital
held by them respectively and apply that sum on their behalf in paying up in full any shares or debentures of the Company of a
nominal amount equal to that sum and allot the shares or debentures credited as fully paid to those members, or as they may direct, in
those proportions or in paying up the whole or part of any amounts which are unpaid in respect of any issued shares in the Company
held by them respectively, or otherwise deal with such sum as directed by the resolution provided that the share premium account,
the capital redemption reserve, any redenomination reserve and any sum not available for distribution in accordance with the Statutes
may only be applied in paying up shares to be allotted credited as fully paid up.
(b)
Where any difficulty arises in respect of any distribution of any capitalised reserve or other sum, the Board may settle the difficulty as it
thinks fit and in particular may make such provisions as it thinks fit in the case of shares or debentures becoming distributable in fractions
(including provisions under which, in whole or in part, the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to the Company rather than the
members concerned) or ignore fractions and may fix the value for distribution of any fully paid up shares or debentures and may determine
that cash payments be made to any members on the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any
shares or debentures in trustees upon such trusts for the persons entitled to share in the distribution as the Board may think fit.
(c)
The Board may also authorise any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to share in the distribution a contract for the acceptance
by those persons of the shares or debentures to be allotted to them credited as fully paid under a capitalisation and any such contract shall
be binding on all those persons.
120. Capitalisation of reserves – employees’ share schemes
(a)
This article (which is without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of article 119) applies where, pursuant to an employees’ share
scheme:
(i)
a person is granted a right to acquire shares in the Company for no payment or at a price less than their nominal value; or
(ii)
the terms on which any person is entitled to acquire shares in the Company are adjusted so that the price payable to acquire them is
less than their nominal value,
and the relevant shares are to be subscribed.
(b)
In any such case the Board:
(i)
may, without requiring any further authority of the Company in general meeting, at any time transfer to a reserve account a sum (the
reserve amount) which is equal to the amount required to pay up the nominal value of the shares in full, after taking into account the
amount (if any) payable by the person from the profits or reserves of the Company which are available for distribution and not
required for the payment of any preferential dividend; and
B-51
Table of Contents
(ii)
(subject to paragraph (d) below) will not apply the reserve amount for any purpose other than paying up the nominal value on the
allotment of the relevant shares.
(c)
Whenever the Company allots shares to a person pursuant to a right described in article 120(a), the Board will (subject to the Statutes)
appropriate to capital the amount of the reserve amount necessary to pay up the nominal value of those shares in full, after taking into
account the amount (if any) payable by the person, apply that amount in paying up the nominal value of those shares in full and allot those
shares credited as fully paid to the person entitled to them.
(d)
If any person ceases to be entitled to acquire shares as described in article 120(a), the restrictions on the reserve amount will cease to apply
in relation to the part of that amount (if any) applicable to those shares.
RECORD DATES
121. Fixing of record dates
(a)
Notwithstanding any other of these articles, but without prejudice to any rights attached to any shares and subject always to the
Companies Law, the Company or the Board may fix any date as the record date by reference to which a dividend will be declared or paid or a
distribution, allotment or issue made, and that date may be before, on or after the date on which the dividend, distribution, allotment or issue
is declared, paid or made.
(b)
In the absence of a record date being fixed, entitlement to any dividend, distribution, allotment or issue shall be determined by reference to
the date on which the dividend is declared or the distribution, allotment or issue is made.
ACCOUNTS
122. Accounting records
(a)
The Board shall cause accounting records of the Company to be kept in accordance with the Statutes.
(b)
No member (as such) shall have any right of inspecting any account, book or document of the Company, except as conferred by law or
authorised by the Board or by any ordinary resolution of the Company.
REGISTER
123. Register Requirements
(a)
The directors shall keep, or cause to be kept, at the transfer office (but in relation to the principal register not, for the avoidance of doubt, at
a place outside Jersey), the register in the manner required by the Companies Law.
(b)
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the Company may keep an overseas branch register in any country, territory or place (other
than in the United Kingdom). The Board may (subject to the Companies Law and the requirement that no overseas branch register shall be
kept in the United Kingdom) make and vary such regulations as it may think fit in relation to the keeping of any such overseas branch
register, including any regulations regarding the transfer of shares from such overseas branch register to the register, the transfer of shares
from the register to such overseas branch register or the inspection of the overseas branch register. For so long as the shares of the
Company are listed on NASDAQ, the Company shall maintain a US branch register.
B-52
Table of Contents
(c)
For so long as the shares of the Company are listed on NASDAQ, all members shall have their shares registered on the US branch register
unless the Board otherwise resolves. The Board may take such action as it deems necessary to transfer any shares from the principal
register or any other register to the US branch register. Each director (acting alone) will be deemed to have been appointed as the agent of
any holder with shares registered on any register other than the US branch register with full power to execute, complete and deliver, in the
name of and on behalf of the holder, any transfer form or other documents necessary to transfer such shares from the relevant register to the
US branch register. Such appointment is:
(i)
made with effect from the later of (i) the holder becoming the holder of such shares and (ii) any share in the Company being listed on
NASDAQ; and
(ii)
irrevocable for a period of one year thereafter.

communication given to any member pursuant to these articles shall, notwithstanding that the member is then dead or bankrupt or that any other
event giving rise to the transmission of the share by operation of law has occurred and whether or not the Company has notice of the death,
bankruptcy or other event, be deemed to have been properly given in respect of any share registered in the name of that member as sole or joint

The Company’s power of sale shall extend to any further share which, on or before the sending of the notice pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii)
above, is issued in right of a share to which paragraph (a) above applies (or in right of any share to which this paragraph applies) if the

Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
Corporate information
Babylon Holdings Limited (the “Company”) is a company limited by shares and is incorporated, registered and domiciled in Jersey. The address of the
registered office is 31 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3QA.
Babylon Holdings Limited is a digital health company engaged in developing affordable healthcare services accessible to consumers on digital devices
platforms and providing technology solutions to medical professionals by automating routine tasks for the care of patients. It also uses its technology to
step in early and help consumers become more informed about diseases, so they can make informed decisions and stay healthier longer. Babylon
combines cutting edge artificial intelligence (“AI”) and broader technologies with the best human expertise to re-engineer a better model of healthcare.
On June 3, 2021, Babylon announced it entered into a definitive merger agreement with Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp (“Alkuri Group”), a special
purpose acquisition company (the “Merger”) following the unanimous approval of the Board of Directors of the Group and Alkuri Group. The transaction
is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to the approval of Alkuri Global’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including
applicable regulatory approvals. If the transaction is consummated, the combined company will operate as Babylon and plans to trade on the New York
stock exchange.
2.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
These condensed unaudited consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 (“Interim Financial Statements”) have been
prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the IASB, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s last annual
consolidated financial statements as at and for year ended December 31, 2020 (“last annual financial statements”). They do not include all of the
information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Standards. However selected explanatory notes are
included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s consolidated financial position and
consolidated performance since the last annual financial statements. These condensed unaudited consolidated interim financial statements were
authorized for issue on September 15, 2021.
Going concern
The Group incurred a loss for the six-month period ending June 30, 2021 of $75,789 thousand (2020: loss of $89,283 thousand), and operating cash
outflows of $19,466 thousand (2020: $87,391 thousand). As of June 30, 2021, the Group had a net asset position of $58,020 thousand (2020: $48,359
thousand). The Group has financed its operations principally through issuances of debt and equity securities and has a strong record of fundraising,
evidenced by its successful Series C raise, execution of a $200,000 thousand Convertible Loan Note agreement and the issuance of $50,000 thousand in
unsecured bonds in August 2021. The Group requires significant cash resources to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, increase
headcount, make capital expenditures (including those related to product development), and expand our business through acquisitions.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the directors consider to be appropriate for the following reasons.
The directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements which indicate that,
taking account of reasonably possible downsides, the Group will have

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Babylon Holdings Limited:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Babylon Holdings Limited and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and
2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s dependency on its ability to raise further capital in the short term gives rise to significant
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.

Corporate information
Babylon Holdings Limited (the “Company”) is a company limited by shares and is incorporated, registered and domiciled in Jersey. The address of the
registered office is 31 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE1 1FT.
Babylon Holdings Limited is a digital health company engaged in developing affordable healthcare services accessible to consumers on digital devices
platforms and providing technology solutions to medical professionals by automating routine tasks for the care of patients. It also uses its technology to
step in early and help consumers become more informed about diseases, so they can make informed decisions and stay healthier longer. Babylon
combines cutting edge artificial intelligence (“AI”) and broader technologies with the best human expertise to re-engineer a better model of healthcare.
2.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
The Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue on
September 15, 2021.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial
statements.
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates
with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in Note 3.
Going concern
At December 31, 2020, the Group incurred a loss for the year of $184,451 thousand (2019: loss of $149,980 thousand), and operating cash outflows of
$143,430 thousand (2019: $143,614 thousand). As of December 31, 2020 the Group had a net asset position of $48,359 thousand (2019: $173,797 thousand).
The Group has financed its operations principally through issuances of debt and equity securities and has a strong record of fundraising, evidenced by
its successful Series C raise, execution of a $200,000 thousand Convertible Loan Note agreement and the issuance of $50,000 thousand in unsecured
bonds in August 2021. The Group requires significant cash resources to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, increase headcount,
make capital expenditures (including those related to product development), and expand our business through acquisitions.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the directors consider to be appropriate for the following reasons.
The directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements which indicate that,
taking account of reasonably possible downsides, the Group will have sufficient funds through injections of further investment capital in order to meet its
liabilities as they fall due for that period (the going concern period). Based upon the forecasts, the directors are expecting to consummate the Merger and
believe that the capital raised will be sufficient to provide adequate funding to service our obligations, meet liquidity needs and fund necessary capital
expenditures through the going concern period. In the event that the Group is unable to consummate the Merger additional funding will be required to be
sought through public or private equity or debt financings to continue our operations.
F-36Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
At December 31, 2020, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $101,757 thousand (2019: $214,888 thousand). The Group has long term debt
obligations that mature in August 2022 for $50,000 thousand (Note 28).
While there is no assurance that the Merger will be consummated or, in the event that the Merger is not consummated, that additional funds are available
on acceptable terms, the directors believe that they will be successful in raising the additional capital needed to meet working capital and capital
expenditure requirements during the going concern period. As noted in Note 28, the Group has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Alkuri
Global Acquisition Corp. The Group expects the Merger will be consummated in the second half of 2021 to deliver a minimum amount of $230,000
thousand, which would provide sufficient additional capital to continue operations over the going concern period. However, the above indicates that
there are material uncertainties (ability to fund raise further capital in the short term) related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, to continue realizing its assets and discharging its liabilities in the normal course of
business.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. To determine
whether the Group controls an entity, status of voting or similar rights, contractual arrangements and other specific factors are considered. Subsidiaries
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on which that control ceases.
The Group holds certain rights in the form of purchase options to acquire additional equity interests in entities that it has an existing shareholding in.
These rights are assessed as either substantive or protective in nature to conclude whether the Group exercises control over the entity. This assessment
requires judgement relating to both the barriers that may prevent, and the extent to which the Group would benefit from, exercise of those rights and
determines whether the Group should consolidate the entity.
In addition, the Company consolidates certain professional service corporations (“PCs”) which are owned, directly or indirectly, and operated by
appropriately licensed physicians. The Company maintains control of these PCs through contractual arrangements, which can include service
agreements, financing agreements, equity transfer restriction agreements, and employment agreements, or a combination thereof, which are primarily
established during the formation of the PCs. At inception, the contractual framework established between the Group and the PCs provides the Group with
the power to direct the relevant activities in the conduct of the PC’s non-clinical administrative and other non-clinical business activities. The physicians
employed by the PC are exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for their patients. In determining whether a
particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input
and a substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally
measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between the Group’s companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
F-37
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Other
Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Changes in the Group’s interest in
a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s
share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until
the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying
amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or has made payments on behalf of an investee.
Reclassifications
In 2020, following the start of the VBC (Value-Based Care) revenue stream, management reviewed the presentation of the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss and considered whether it continued to provide relevant and reliable information to stakeholders. It was concluded that there should be an
update to how certain expenses were classified and therefore the Group has changed its accounting policy for expense classifications. Previously, the
Group had disclosed Depreciation and Amortization as a separate expense category, whereas now Depreciation and Amortization costs are allocated to
their relevant function.
In addition, the Group elected to separately present costs of revenue relating to its Platform and application expenses, including the amortization and
impairment, and Research and development expenses, excluding the amortization and impairment, in its Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The
elective disaggregated presentation of amounts previously classified as Research & development and technology expenses was applied retrospectively
to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
With the exception of the change in presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, these elective changes had no impact on the Group’s
Loss for the period or to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Change in accounting policies
R&D tax credits claimed and reimbursed through the U.K. research and development expenditure credit scheme (the “RDEC Scheme”) are recognized
gross as a deferred income grant liability on the balance sheet and as a reduction to Platform & application expenses over the period of expected benefit
from the expenditure. The related tax charge on the credit is recognised in the year of the tax credit. This represents a change in accounting policy elected
by the Group for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in accounting policy did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.
3.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The
F-38
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
judgments, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, the resulting accounting estimates may differ from
actual results.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. No changes were made to
the estimates and assumptions used in the last year.
The areas involving significant estimates or judgements are:
Revenue recognition (Note 6)
The Group has determined that a portion of the transaction price under capitation revenue contracts is variable as the contracts contain provisions for
performance-based incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares where amounts received are dependent upon factors such as quality metrics,
member-specific attributes, and healthcare service costs. The variable portion of capitation revenue is estimated using the most likely amount
methodology and amounts are only included in revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not
occur once any uncertainty is resolved. Capitation revenue is recognised gross when it is assessed that the performance obligation relates to the whole
of the patient journey with the Group responsible for arranging, providing and controlling the VBC services provided to the attributed members. This is a
significant judgement when assessing the performance obligation. For the year ended 31 December 2020 Capitation revenue totalling $26,038 thousand
(2019: $0) was recognised gross.
Capitalization of development costs (Note 15)
The Group capitalizes expenditures for the development of technology to the extent that it is expected to meet the criteria in accordance with IAS 38,
Intangible Assets (“IAS 38”). The decision to capitalize is based on significant judgments made by management, including the technical feasibility of
completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale and assumptions used to demonstrate that the asset will generate probable
future economic benefits (e.g., projected cash flow projections, discount rate). Development Costs of $43,027 thousand (2019:$36,036 thousand) were
capitalized in the year based on a model whereby a percentage is allocated to employee related expenses based on the time spent on the development of
assets. All employee expenses included in this balance relate to employees in the technology departments, and the percentage attributable varies
dependent on the nature of the work performed and the type of asset being developed.
Impairment of intangible assets (Note 15)
The carrying values of our long-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. If any indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Determining the
recoverable amount is subjective and requires management to estimate future growth, profitability, discount and terminal growth rates, and project future
cash flows, among other factors. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may
result in changes to our estimates of future cash flows.
If we conclude that a definite or indefinite long-lived intangible asset is impaired, we recognize a loss in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying
value of the asset over its fair value at the date of impairment. The fair value at the date of the impairment becomes the new cost basis and will result in a
lower depreciation expense than for periods before the asset’s impairment.
F-39

Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Consolidation (Note 16)
The Group holds certain rights in the form of purchase options to acquire additional equity interests in entities that it has an existing shareholding in.
These rights are assessed as either substantive or protective in nature to conclude whether the Group exercises control over the entity. This assessment
requires judgement relating to both the barriers that may prevent, and the extent to which the Group would benefit from, exercise of those rights and
determines whether the Group should consolidate the entity.
4.
Accounting policies
The Group has previously prepared the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the
European Union, however the Group could have asserted it was in compliance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board for
the previous period. There is no material difference noted on adoption and therefore, the Group is not considered a first-time adopter.
The consolidated Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, as modified by the recognition of certain financial
instruments measured at fair value and are presented in United States Dollar (“USD”) which is the Group’s presentation currency. All values are rounded
to the nearest thousands, except where otherwise indicated.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is primarily derived from the following sources: (1) software license fees for the provision of AI services, (2) patient revenues from the provision
of clinical services, and (3) capitation revenue from value-based care services.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Group expects to receive
in exchange for those services.
Contract assets are recognized when there is an excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts where the rights are conditional on something other
than passage of time. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (i.e. only invoicing is pending) when there is an unconditional right to receive
cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
Income received in advance (“contract liability”) is recognized when there are billings in excess of revenues earned for services rendered.
The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. The Group assesses the services promised in a
contract and identifies distinct or bundled performance obligations in the contract. Identification of these performance obligations involves judgement to
determine the promises and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such promises. If multiple performance obligations are identified in
the contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Group recognizes
revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. Transaction prices are adjusted for the effects of a significant financing
component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and when the
customer pays for that service will be more than one year.
The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Group
considers indicators such as how a customer consumes benefits as services
F-40
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
are rendered, existence of enforceable rights to payment for performance to date, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer and acceptance
of delivery of the service by the customer.
Software licensing revenue
Under IFRS 15, the Group must determine whether the Group’s promise to grant a software license provides its customer with either a right to access the
Group’s intellectual property (“IP”) or a right to use the Group’s IP. A software license will provide a right to access the IP if there is significant
development of the IP expected in the future, whereas for a right to use, the IP is to be used in the condition it is at the time the software license is signed.
Our license fee revenue consists of AI services that are provided on a continuous basis for the contractual period. We have determined that the customer
obtains a right to access our AI services and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term beginning when the customer has
access to the service. Any contract specific revenue relating to localisation of services prior to the commencement of software license term is not deemed
to be distinct from the software license contract and is consequently also recognized over the software license term. Efforts to satisfy performance
obligations are expended evenly throughout the performance period and so the performance obligation is considered to be satisfied evenly over time.
In some cases, we have concluded that upfront payments included in software license contracts with customers have a significant financing component
considering the period between the upfront payment and the services provided, when the contract term is more than one year. As a result, the transaction
price must be adjusted to account for the time value of money by using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate utilized is determined based on
the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction with the customer. When a significant financing component exists, we recognize a
contract liability for the entire upfront cash payment received, excluding the amount relating to the financing component from the transaction price.
Additionally, interest expense is recognized over the duration of the contract under the amortised interest method.
Clinical service revenue
Clinical service revenue represents clinical services provided to our business and private patients under an arrangement and is recognized when the
services are rendered. Our clinical service fees are based on PMPM (per member per month) subscription fees and fees per appointment (“fee for
service”). PMPM subscription fees give members access to our clinical services over the contractual period as set forth in the arrangement, recognized
monthly based on the number of members covered by the plan in a given month. Fee for service is based on contracted rates determined in agreed-upon
compensation schedules and is recognized when the services are rendered at a point in time. In arrangements where PMPM subscription fees are charged
we assess whether any of the transaction price should be allocated to software licensing revenue and allocate on a contract by contract basis.
Capitation revenue
Capitation revenue consists primarily of per capita fees for the delivery of VBC (Value-Based care) services by the Group under arrangements with various
customers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, we are entitled to monthly PMPM fees to provide a defined range of VBC services to attributed
members. PMPM fees are based upon fixed rates per member or a percentage of the per member premium of the health plan and are not dependent upon
the volume of specific care services provided. In addition, the arrangements usually include payments relating to performance-based incentives,
performance guarantees and risk shares. Unlike clinical services revenue discussed above, the Group accepts full financial risk for members attributed to
our VBC services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee, which means we are responsible for the cost of all covered services provided to members.
F-41
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
In general, the Group considers all capitation revenue contracts as containing a single performance obligation to stand ready to provide managed VBC
services to the attributed members. This performance obligation is satisfied over time as the Group stands ready to fulfil its obligation to the attributed
members as a group. Accordingly, the Group recognizes revenue in the month in which attributed members are entitled to receive VBC services during the
contract term.
Part of the consideration received under capitation revenue contracts are variable as the contracts contain provisions for performance-based incentives,
performance guarantees and risk shares where amounts received are dependent upon factors such as quality metrics, member-specific attributes, and
healthcare service costs. Capitation revenue is estimated using the most likely amount methodology and amounts are only included in revenue to the
extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved. Such uncertainties may
only be resolved several months after the end of the reporting period because of the availability of sufficient reliable data relating to factors such as
quality metrics, member specific attributes and healthcare service costs. Subsequent changes in capitation fees and the amount of capitation revenue to
be recognized by the Company are reflected in subsequent periods.
Capitation revenue is recognised gross when it is assessed that the performance obligation relates to the whole of the patient journey with the Group
responsible for arranging, providing and controlling the VBC services provided to the attributed members, with expenses payable to other healthcare.
Cost of care delivery
Cost of care delivery primarily consists of fees paid to the physicians and other health professionals in our provider network and costs incurred in
connection with our provider network operations. Cost of care delivery is mainly driven by patient activity and required medical services and are
relatively variable. Costs incurred relating to the delivery of VBC services is recorded as an expense within cost of care delivery when capitation revenue
is recognized.
Grant income
We recognize income related to grants on a systematic and rational basis when it becomes probable that we have complied with the terms and conditions
of the grant and in the period in which the corresponding costs or income related to the grant are recognized. We receive grants in the form of cash
contributions towards outreach projects and tax credits for certain qualifying research and development expenditures. These grants are recognised as
non-current deferred grant income liability, released either over the period of the grant contract or over the same period that the related capitalized
development costs are amortized. The offset to the release of the long term deferred grant income liability is recognised as revenue for outreach grants
and a reduction in Platform and application expenses for tax credits.
Substantially all of the amortization of Deferred grant income from grants received in 2020 and prior years is expected to commence in 2021.
Platform and application expenses
Platform and application expenses are costs of revenue to our digital healthcare platform. These costs primarily include employee-related salaries,
benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and consultant expenses, that are engaged in providing professional services related to
support and maintenance of the digital healthcare platform, as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other direct costs. The
amortization of capitalized development costs are also included in Platform and application expenses.
F-42
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved
products and processes, is capitalized if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and if the Group has sufficient resources to
complete the development. Capitalized development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortized from the point at which the development is
complete, and the asset is available for use. Costs are capitalized based on a model whereby a percentage is allocated to employee related expenses based
on the time spent on the development of assets. Subsequent expenditure on capitalized intangible assets is capitalized only when it increases the future
economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All employee expenses included in this balance relate to employees in the
technology departments, and the percentage attributable varies dependent on the nature of the work performed and the type of asset being developed.
Expenses that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
The technical feasibility of a new product is determined by a management team consisting of technical and finance leads based on understanding the
availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources required to develop the product. The commercial feasibility of a new product is
determined by understanding how this product feeds into Babylon’s current offering. Commercial leads ascertain market interest by evaluating against
existing and potential customer requirements. Feasibility is challenged with input from finance leads to verify the underlying financial implications of
development and assess viability. Once the technical and commercial feasibility has been established and the project has been approved for
commencement, the project moves into the development phase.
As described in Note 3, development costs of approximately $43,027 (2019: $36,036 thousand) were capitalized during the year for those development and
technology expenses that were deemed technologically feasible and probable of generating future economic benefits. During the period of development,
the asset is tested for impairment at least annually.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses primarily included employee-related salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and
consultant expenses that are engaged in performing activities to develop and improve the Group’s digital healthcare platform as well as third-party
application costs, hosting services and other indirect costs. Research costs and development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are
expensed as incurred.
Sales, general & administrative expense
Sales, general and administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, contractors and consultants expense, stock-based compensation,
property and facility related expenses, IT and hosting, marketing, training and recruiting expenses. Enterprise IT and hosting costs are primarily software
subscriptions, domain and hosting costs. Our sales, general and administrative expenses also include depreciation of property, fixtures and fittings and
amortization of acquired intangible assets.
Claim expenses and claims payable
Claims expense, presented within Cost of care delivery, and claims payable, which are presented within Trade and other payables and Accruals and
provisions, includes costs for third party healthcare service providers who provide medical care to our members for which the Group is contractually
obligated to pay. The estimated reserve for incurred but not reported claims is included in the liability for unpaid claims in the
F-43

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
consolidated balance sheets. Actual claims expense will differ from the estimated liability due to factors in estimated and actual member utilization of
health care services, the amount of charges and other factors. We determine our estimates through a variety of actuarial models based on medical claims
history to ensure our estimates represent the best, most reasonable estimate given the data available to us at the time the estimates are made. The
actuarial models consider factors such as seasonal variances, healthcare contract rate changes, membership volume and demographics, as well as other
medical cost trends. The Group estimates claim costs incurred by applying an observed medical cost trend factors to the average PMPM (per member per
month fees) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claims data is available. For the months prior to the most recent three months,
the Group applies an expected completion true up to adjust expenses for this time period based on the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for
those months. In accordance with its policy, the Group reviews its estimated liability for unpaid claims on an ongoing basis.
Taxation
Tax on the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets
or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries
to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Expenditures incurred for R&D activities have been claimed and will be reimbursed through the U.K. research and development expenditure credit scheme
(the “RDEC Scheme”). Under the RDEC Scheme tax relief is given at 12.0% (up to April 1, 2020) and 13.0% (after April 1, 2020) of allowable R&D costs,
which may result in a payable tax credit at an effective rate of approximately 10.3% of qualifying expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
Group recognizes the gross amount as a deferred income grant liability on the balance sheet and as a reduction to Platform & application Expenses over
the period of expected benefit from the expenditure. The related tax charge on the credit is recognised in the year of the tax credit.
A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference
can be utilized.
Net loss per share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock of the Group outstanding
during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including outstanding stock options,
warrants and convertible notes, to the extent dilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented as the inclusion of all
potential shares of common stock outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.

Comprehensive loss
Comprehensive loss consists primarily of cumulative translation gains or losses. Unrealized gains or losses are net of any reclassification adjustments for
realized gains and losses included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Segment Reporting
IFRS 8, Operating Segments (“IFRS 8”) requires an entity to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments, which are
operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components of an entity about which
separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). According to IFRS 8, the CODM
represents a function whereby strategic decisions are made, and resources are assigned. The CODM function is carried out by the Group’s Chief
Executive Officer.
Segment information is presented based on information used by the CODM in its decision-making processes. The CODM is responsible for the Group’s
key strategic and business decisions and driving the direction and growth of the Group. These include but are not limited to international growth, new
services, material business agreements and corporate and management structures. The CODM’s key decisions are based on the monthly management
accounts in which segment information is presented on the basis of geographic areas. Each segment derives its revenues from software license fees for
the provision of AI services, patient revenues from the provision of clinical services and VBC services provided by the segment which may differ from
the geographic location of the customer. Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is used to measure performance of
each segment because the Group believes that this information is most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments. The accounting
policies for segment information, including transactions entered between segments are generally the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. The CODM is not provided with total assets and liabilities by segment, and therefore the disclosures below do not
include these measures.
Segment information is reported from a geographic presence perspective. The Group’s results are provided to CODM disaggregated by geographic
region, including United Kingdom (“UK”), the United States of America (“US”), Canada, Rwanda, and Singapore. The Group assessed the geographical
segments within the aggregation guidance provided in IFRS 8 and determined that the UK and US segments each exceed the quantitative thresholds and
represent individual reportable segments. The remaining geographical regions individually and in aggregate do not exceed the quantitative thresholds for
reportable segments. Therefore, the UK and the US segments are the Group’s reportable segments for the purposes of these consolidated financial
statements.
Business combinations
The acquisition consideration is measured at fair value which is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or
assumed and the equity interests in exchange for control. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a
contingent consideration arrangement. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The consideration transferred in a business combination shall be measured at fair value, which shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair
values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by
the acquirer. The allocation
F-45
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
process requires an analysis of acquired contracts, customer relationships, contractual commitments, and legal contingencies to identify and record the
fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In valuing acquired assets and assumed liabilities, fair values are based on, but are not limited to,
future expected cash flows, current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, and
appropriate discount rates and growth rates.
Where the consideration transferred, together with the non-controlling interest, exceeds the fair value of the net assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired, the excess is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred and classified as “Sales, general and
administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Goodwill is capitalized as a separate item in the case of subsidiaries. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the operation acquired.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss. When the Group increases their ownership interests held in one of its consolidated subsidiaries, any difference between the
consideration given and the aggregate carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity at the date of the transaction is included in equity
in retained earnings.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, which includes capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
-
Computer equipment
3 years
-
Fixtures and fittings
4 years
At the end of each reporting period, the depreciation method, useful life and residual value of each asset is reviewed. Any revisions are accounted for
prospectively as a change in estimate.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable
amount.
When an asset is disposed, the gain or loss is calculated by comparing proceeds received with its carrying amount and is taken to the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets include capitalized development costs separately acquired in the normal course of business are recorded at historical cost, and
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
value at the acquisition date. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite
useful life are at least reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in
Depreciation and amortization.
The useful lives of the Group’s intangible assets are:
-
Development costs
1-10 years
-
Customer relationships
11 months
-
Trade names
10 years
-
Physician network
10 years
An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal (i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no future economic benefits are expected from
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured as described in “Business combinations” above. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill
is not amortized and is reviewed for impairment at least annually as of our third quarter ended September 30 or more frequently if triggering events occur
or impairment indicators exist. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (“CGUs”), or groups
of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units represents the lowest level within the entity at
which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Trade receivable
We use a forward-looking expected credit loss (“ECL”) model in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts as it relates to trade receivables,
contract assets, and other financial assets. Our allowance is based on historical experience, and includes consideration of the aging of the receivables,
the economic environment, industry trend analysis, and the credit history and financial conditions of the customers among other factors. We measure an
impairment loss as the excess of the carrying amount over the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted using the financial asset’s
original discount rate, and we recognize this loss in our Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. A financial asset is written-off or written-down to its
net realizable value as soon as it is known to be impaired. We adjust previous write-downs to reflect changes in estimates or actual experience. Our
allowance for doubtful accounts is not material.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale when:
•
They are available for immediate sale
•
Management is committed to a plan to sell
•
It is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn
•
An active programme to locate a buyer has been initiated
•
The asset or disposal group is being marketed at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value, and
•
A sale is expected to complete within 12 months from the date of classification.
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount immediately prior to being classified
as held for sale in accordance with the group’s accounting policy; and fair value less costs of disposal.
An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is
recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment
loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized at
the date of derecognition.
Following their classification as held for sale, non-current assets (including those in a disposal group) are not depreciated. Interest and other expenses
attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognized.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. The Group had
no restricted cash amounts as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
Impairment of non-financial assets excluding deferred tax assets
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying
values may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal (market value) and value in use determined using estimates of
discounted future net cash flows of the asset or group of assets to which it belongs. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units).
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated
reliably.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Share-based payment transactions
The Group and the Company operates a share option scheme. It issues equity settled share-based payments to both employees and non-employees
within the Group, whereby services are rendered in exchange for rights to purchase shares of the Company. Non-employees include contractors and
advisors.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in
equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an
option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognized as an expense is
adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions (if applicable) are expected to be met,
such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance
conditions at the vesting date. The forfeitures rate is estimated and revised at each reporting date based on historical actuals. For share-based payment
awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions, and there is no true-up
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Valuation of ordinary shares
As there has been no public market for the Group’s ordinary shares to date, the estimated fair value of the ordinary shares has been determined by the
board of directors as of the date of each grant, with input from management, considering the most recently available third-party valuations of the Group’s
ordinary shares, and the assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that they believed were relevant and which may have changed from
the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at
fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange
differences arising on translation are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s
presentational currency, United States Dollars, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are
translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognized as other comprehensive loss.
Provisions
A provision is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
a past event, that can be reliably measured, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
F-49

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Equity issuance costs
The Group recognizes incremental external costs directly attributable to an equity issuance transaction as a deduction from equity. Any transaction costs
are therefore deducted from share premium where possible to do so.
Leases
Our lease contracts primarily include real estate leases for buildings and are accounted for under IFRS 16, Leases (“IFRS 16”).
We assess whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. We recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with
respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of
low value assets. For these leases, we recognize the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless
another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Financial Instruments
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in fair value are recognized
in finance income or finance costs as appropriate.
Convertible loan notes
Under IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation (“IAS 32”), the liability and equity components of convertible loan notes must be presented
separately on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. If the conversion option exchanges a fixed number of shares for a fixed amount of cash
(“fixed for fixed”) then it is classified as an equity instrument. The Group has examined the terms of each issue of convertible loan notes and determined
their accounting treatment accordingly.
The Group considers loans where the holder on the principal amount, for which there is no obligation to settle in cash, is also recognized in the share
premium reserve. Upon redemption of the instrument and the issue of share capital, the amount is reclassified from the share premium reserve to share
capital and share premium.
The Group considers convertible loans where the holder does have the option to repay in cash or where there is not a fixed for fixed conversion feature to
be convertible debt instruments with an embedded equity conversion feature and recognizes the principal of the loan note as a debt liability in the
liabilities section of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the equity conversion feature as an equity derivative instrument that is
measured at fair value through profit or loss. The accrued interest on the principal amount is recorded as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Loss and as an increase in the debt liability. Upon redemption of the instrument and the issue of share capital, the amount is reclassified from
the debt liability to share capital and share premium.
Fair value measurements
The accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and requires
disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Group. The accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation
hierarchy for disclosures of fair value
F-50
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
measurement and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow:
•
Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
•
Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. For assets
and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred
between levels in the fair value hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.
The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial
instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their
expected realisation and their current market rate of interest. The Group does not have any other material assets or liabilities that are recognized at fair
value on a recurring basis.

The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements. Their adoption is not
expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated.

Business Acquisitions
As part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and may acquire in the future, certain businesses and technologies primarily to expand our service
offerings.
Acquisitions in the current period
On October 1, 2020, the Group entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire the contracts of the Fresno Health Care business of FirstChoice
Medical Group (together, “Fresno”) for $25,671 thousand of cash consideration. The acquisition of the contracts and transfer of related operational
processes is required to be

accounted for under IFRS 3. The Group incurred $654 thousand of direct costs for legal, financial advisory, tax, and other services related to the
transaction. These are operating costs which have been expensed to sales, general and administrative expenses during the period in which they were
incurred and are final.
The estimated fair value of assets acquired as of the acquisition date were as follows:

Goodwill

The assets acquired include customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, and physician networks. To determine the fair value of the acquired
assets the Company used the present value of future cash flows for customer relationships, the expected revenue attributable over ten years with a 0.5%
royalty rate and 10% discount rate for trademarks and trade names, and the expected replacement costs over two years for physician networks.
The purchase price of $25,671 thousand exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired from Fresno by approximately $17,771 thousand and was
recorded as goodwill, which has been allocated to the Fresno CGU. Goodwill represents benefits from Fresno’s assembled workforce and expected
synergies and has been calculated by subtracting the fair value of net assets acquired from the consideration paid.
Total revenues attributable to the assets acquired from Fresno since the acquisition were approximately $16,085 thousand for the year ended December
31, 2020. Net loss attributable to the assets acquired from Fresno since the acquisition was $2,766 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. If the
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been $128,294 thousand (higher by $49,022
thousand) and consolidated losses would have been $179,355 thousand (lower by $3,982 thousand) for the year ended December 31, 2020. In determining
these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020.
Fiscal Year 2019 Acquisitions
In fiscal year 2019, the Group acquired preference shares in Health Innovators Inc. for initial consideration of $4,000 thousand satisfied in cash. As a
result, the Group has rights associated with the ownership of 56,678 thousand shares (approximately 80% ownership), subject to further investments,
repurchase by Health Innovators Inc. if further investments were not made, and restrictions and limitations in Health Innovators Inc’s charter and the
stock purchase agreement through which the Group made its investment. Additionally, the Group has power over the investee, exposure and rights to
variable returns and the ability to influence returns, giving the group control over the investee.
Taking control of Health Innovators Inc. enables the Group to provide accessible and affordable healthcare as Health Innovators Inc. provides secondary
– specifically, post-surgical – care to patients.

Goodwill of $61 thousand has arisen on the acquisition of Health Innovators Inc.
For the three months ended December 31, 2019, Health Innovators Inc. contributed revenue of $1 thousand and losses after tax of $845 thousand to the
Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019, management estimates that consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31,
2019 would have been $16,034 thousand (remained unchanged) and consolidated losses for the financial year would have been $141,326 thousand
(higher by $1,039 thousand). In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of
acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019.
Babylon Holdings Limited has the option to increase their investment in stages, exercisable for a period of 4-years. The investment option is considered a
derivative and has no impact to the consolidated financial statements given it is eliminated upon consolidation.
Management has elected to recognize non-controlling interest (“NCI”) on the proportionate basis. In the event of a liquidation, Babylon has a preferential
right to recover amounts invested prior to any distribution to other shareholders or Babylon will receive its percentage of net assets of Health
Innovators, whichever is greater. On the acquisition date, the net assets of Health Innovators were valued at $3,939 thousand which was less than the
priority payment of $4,000 thousand. Net assets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 were lower than Babylon’s total investment at that date. As
a result, in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, Babylon consolidated 100.0% of Health
Innovators Inc.’s net assets and no NCI has been recognized.
In fiscal year 2020, Babylon invested further in Health Innovators Inc. for consideration of $6,640 thousand satisfied in cash. There was no impact on the
consolidated statement of cash flows from this event, as 100% of Health Innovators Inc. is consolidated. Ownership rights remain associated with the
ownership of 56,678 thousand shares (approximately 80% ownership), provided that certain rights are governed by Health Innovators Inc.’s charter and
the stock purchase agreement that Babylon entered into with Health Innovators Inc. and its primary founder. Health Innovators Inc. continues to
evaluate future funding needs and alternatives, including through discussions with Babylon. To the extent that Health Innovators Inc. is unable to obtain
the future funding it requires, there may be an indication that our intangible assets relating to Health Innovators Inc are impaired.

The contract assets primarily relate to the Group’s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. There was no impact on
contract assets as a result of acquisition of subsidiaries. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. This
usually occurs when the Group issues an invoice to the customer. The Group’s customers generally pay for invoices in the month following the issuance
date.
iii) Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
The following table includes revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially
unsatisfied) at the reporting date.

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19.0% (effective from April 1, 2017) was substantively enacted on October 26, 2015, and an additional
reduction to 17.0% (effective April 1, 2020) was substantively enacted on September 6, 2016. The government announced that the corporation tax rate for
the years starting April 1, 2020 and 2021 would remain at 19.0%. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly.
On March 3, 2021 it was announced that the UK tax rate will increase to 25.0% on April 1, 2023. This will have a consequential effect on the Group’s future
tax charge.
Unrecognized deferred tax assets
Due to uncertainty over future profitability, a deferred tax asset of $80,811 thousand (2019: $37,907 thousand) relating to losses and other deductions, as
well as intangible asset and short-term timing differences, has not been recognized. A tax rate of 19.0% was used to calculate the deferred tax asset.

Goodwill of $17,832 thousand (2019: $61 thousand). has been acquired through business combinations (Note 5). $17,771 thousand is related to the
acquisition of Fresno and the acquisition of Health Innovators Inc is attributable to the remaining $61 thousand. Goodwill is allocated to the Fresno CGU
and Health Innovators Inc CGU respectively.
All development costs, including intangibles under development, have been internally generated by the Group. During 2020, $51,932 thousand of
intangibles under development were transferred to development costs as these projects were completed. Intangibles under development are tested for
impairment at least annually.

Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The total net book value is considered to be the recoverable amount, as this balance is reviewed annually and impaired as necessary (Note 4). All
development costs are related to software and artificial intelligence development and there are no distinguishable individually material intangible assets
within the capitalized development costs. Following an assessment of the future development of our technology, capitalized development costs were
impaired by $6,436 thousand in 2020. This impairment was primarily the result of the discontinuation of certain features in 2020 surrounding a proprietary
data structure for encounters on our software platform that were deemed to be no longer technologically feasible.
Impairment Analysis for CGU’s Containing Goodwill and Intangibles
Goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. The fair value of Goodwill is generally determined using the discounted cash flow method. As of
December 31, 2020, the Fresno CGU was the only CGU with a material amount of goodwill, thus triggering an impairment analysis.
The recoverable amount of the Fresno CGU that included these intangible assets was estimated based on the present value of the future cash flows
expected to be derived from the CGU (value in use), assuming a Medicare Advantage growth rate of 8.0% and using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% and a
terminal value growth rate of 3.0% from 2025. The recoverable amount of Fresno CGU’s was estimated to be higher than its carrying amount, and as a
result there was no impairment related to Fresno for the fourth quarter of 2020.
The below are factors considered when performing the 2020 sensitivity analysis:
Terminal value growth rate: Babylon used a terminal growth value of 3.0% which is consistent with what was used to prepare the valuation of the Fresno
acquisition. Babylon believes that it is appropriate to be consistent with the terminal growth value used less than 3 months prior and provided by
industry experts. Any increase to this produces more headroom and therefore shall not be considered. A 2.5% terminal growth rate would have resulted
in a change of $1,321 thousand, and a 2.0% terminal growth rate would have resulted in a change of $2,477 thousand.
Discount factor: Babylon used a discount factor of 10.0% which is consistent with what was used to prepare the valuation of the Fresno acquisition.
Babylon believes that it is appropriate to be consistent with the discount rate used less than 3 months prior. A lower discount rate produces more
headroom and therefore shall not be considered. A reduction in the discount rate to 10.5% would have resulted in an NPV change of $1,665 thousand,
and a discount rate of 11.0% which would have resulted in an NPV change of $3,312 thousand.
Medicare Advantage Growth Numbers: Babylon used an expected growth rate in Medicare Advantage member numbers year on year of 8.0%. This
growth rate is determined by the Value Based Care teams and the sensitivities in this growth rate are continuously monitored by Babylon. A growth rate
higher than 8.0% produces more headroom and therefore shall not be considered. A 7.5% terminal growth rate would have resulted in NPV change of
$1,125 thousand, and 7.0% for growth rates which would have resulted in an NPV change of $2,239 thousand.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Health Innovators, Inc.
Babylon acquired Health Innovators Inc. in 2019. In the event of a liquidation, Babylon has a preferential right to recover amounts invested prior to other
shareholders or receive its percentage of net assets of Health Innovators, whichever is greater. Since the acquisition date the net assets of Health
Innovators Inc. have been less than Babylon’s total investment, therefore Babylon consolidates 100.0% of Health Innovators Inc.’s net assets and no
NCI is recognized. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.
Higi
On May 15, 2020 Babylon Acquisition Corp. acquired 11.0% of the preference shares in Higi SH Holdings Inc. (“Higi”). Higi provides digital healthcare
services via a network of Smart Health Stations located around the USA, the investment is in line with the Group’s objective to provide accessible and
affordable healthcare.
The Group has the option to increase their shareholding in Higi to 25% exercisable over the period to July 2021 and subsequently the option to purchase
the remaining 75% of shares exercisable over the period to May 2023. At December 31, 2020 the total shareholding was 19.0%.
Higi is accounted for as an associate because the Group is able to demonstrate significant influence over Higi through representation on the board, the
power to participate in policy. During the period to December 30, 2020 the Group did not have the substantive rights to exert control over Higi due to the
existence of significant barriers that prevented exercise of the purchase option.
The following table summarizes the financial information of Higi as of December 31, 2020:

$1,124 thousand related to Higi. If the Group did have substantive rights to exert control over Higi, management estimates that consolidated losses would
have been $190,378 thousand (higher by $7,041 thousand) and consolidated net assets would have been $53,875 thousand (higher by $541 thousand) for
the year ended December 31, 2020.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group has assessed its expected credit loss estimate, in line with the requirements of IFRS 9, by taking into consideration historical credit loss
experience and financial factors specific to the debtors and general economic conditions. As part of this assessment, the Group has performed a
recoverability assessment of its outstanding trade and other receivables at the reporting date and concluded that the expected credit loss as of December
31, 2020 is immaterial (2019: $0).

Leases
The Group leases several assets which consist of buildings and IT equipment. The Group recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for its
building leases only, as the leases for IT equipment meet the exemption requirements as short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Therefore, the
disclosures below for the Group’s right-of-use assets relate only to buildings.

In March 2020 Group renewed its head office lease to December 2022 with intention to hand in notice and vacate in 2021. A lease modification has been
applied as per IFRS 16 to extend the lease to the intended exit date.
When measuring the lease liabilities, the Group discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate. The weighted-average rate applied is

On November 12, 2020 the Group executed a Convertible Loan Note agreement (“CLN” or “Loan Notes”) with a borrowing capacity of up to $200,000
thousand, under which $30,000 thousand Tranche 1 Notes and $70,000 thousand Tranche 2 Notes were issued to Global Health Equity (Cyprus) Ltd
(“GHE” or the “Noteholder” or the “Lender”) in November and December 2020. GHE is part of the VNV Global group. VNV Global has a pre-existing
equity interest in Babylon. The notes had a nominal value of $1.
Tranche 1 Notes
Tranche 1 Notes of $30,000 thousand were issued to GHE on November 12, 2020. Interest accrues at a fixed non-compounding rate of 11% per annum from
the date of issuance to redemption or conversion. These notes were subsequently converted into Series C Preferred Shares after the issuance of the
Tranche 2 Notes and shareholder approval of the conversion feature.
F-67
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Tranche 2 Notes
Tranche 2 Notes of $70,000 thousand were issued on December 16, 2020 and are not interest bearing. The Tranche 2 Notes are exchangeable into a
variable number of Series C Preferred Shares upon the earlier of the occurrence of certain events or June 30, 2021. The Tranche 2 Notes have been
recognized as a financial liability as of December 31, 2020.
As the Tranche 2 Notes fail the definition of equity, the Group considered whether the conversion feature in the Tranche 2 Notes is a non-closely related
embedded derivative which would require separation from the debt host contract and to be accounted for separately as a standalone derivative at fair
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). It has been determined that the Tranche 2 Notes represent a hybrid instrument containing a debt host debt
contract and a non-closely related embedded derivative for the conversion feature.
The debt host contract is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method. The fair value of the embedded derivative and
transaction costs associated with issuance of the instrument are not material.

Employee Benefits
Pension plans
The Group operates a defined contribution plan, under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or
constructive obligation to pay further amounts. During fiscal year 2020, the Group paid fixed contributions totalling $13,371 thousand (2019: $9,235
thousand).
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to employees of the Group and advisors, whereby services are rendered in exchange for rights
over shares in the Group. Employees of all Group companies participate within this scheme.
Options are granted to employees at the start of their employment. Upon completion of the first year of employment, 25.0% of options will vest, and the
remainder will vest monthly over the next three years. In certain circumstances, additional options are granted to employees to recognize performance.
Such options vest in the same manner as those granted on joining. Share options are accounted for using the graded vesting method.
Options granted to advisors also vest over a 4-year period, subject to the advisors providing consultancy services on an ad hoc basis and at board
meetings.

The conversion of the Tranche 1 Notes was approved by shareholders on December 16, 2020. Subsequent to this conversion approval, the principal of
the Tranche 1 Notes was reclassified from being recognized as a financial liability to be classified as equity. No material gain or loss was recognized on
conversion. The share capital in relation to the Series C Preferred Shares issued on conversion was recorded at the nominal value of the shares issued.

Shares constituted one and the same class) carry fifty per cent (50.0%) of the total voting rights of the Shares;
•
the Holders of a majority of the A Ordinary Shares shall have the right from time to time to appoint such number of persons to be Directors
of each Group Company equal to the number of Directors which the Holders of B Ordinary Shares and Series C Preferred Shares are entitled
to appoint (in aggregate) plus one additional Director; and in each case to remove from office any persons appointed and to appoint
another person in his or her place
•
The Series C Largest Shareholder shall have the right from time to time to appoint one person to be a Director and to remove from office any
person so appointed and to appoint another person in his or her place.
•

shall have the right from time to time to appoint one person to be a Director for each whole Qualifying Stake held by them and to remove
from office any person so appointed and to appoint another person in his or her place.
On any return of capital on liquidation, the assets of the Group available for distribution shall be distributed:
a)
first, in paying to each of the Series C Preferred Shareholders, in priority to any other classes of Shares, an amount per Series C Preferred
Share held equal to the Preference Amount
b)
second, in paying to the 2016/2017 Subscribers pro rata to their respective holdings of Hoxton Shares and Kinnevik Shares an amount equal
to the Hurdle Amount; and
c)
the balance of the surplus assets (if any) shall be distributed among the holders of the A Ordinary Shares and the B Ordinary Shares pro
rata as if they constituted one and the same class.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and currency risk in cash flows. The Group’s global risk management
programme focuses on uncertainty in the financial markets and aims to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group’s profits. The Group uses
derivatives to mitigate certain risks.
The Group’s financial department controls the management of liquidity risk and currency risk in accordance with the Group’s policies. This department
centrally identifies, evaluates and makes decisions whether to hedge financial risks to which the Group is exposed.
25.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and
arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investments in debt securities. Our cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and loans
with banks and financial institutions are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk.
Bank balances
The Group seeks to limit its credit risk with respect to banks by only dealing with reputable banks. Additionally, the Group holds bank accounts in the
countries in which subsidiaries operate from.
The maximum amount of the Group’s credit risk exposure is the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trades receivable and loans with banks
and financial institutions. The Group attempts to mitigate such exposure to its cash by investing only in financial institutions with investment grade
credit ratings or secured investments. The Group does not have significant exposure to credit risk at December 31, 2020 for any financial instruments.
F-71
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Trade receivables and contract assets
The Group has a diverse customer base geographically and by industry. The responsibility for customer credit risk management rests with management.
The Group seeks to limit its credit risk with respect to customers by implementing due diligence procedures on all customers. Payment terms vary and are
set in accordance with practices in the different geographies and end-markets served. Credit limits are typically established based on internal or external
rating criteria, which take into account such factors as the financial condition of the customers, their credit history and the risk associated with their
industry segment.
More than 50% of the Group’s customers are repeat customers, and none of these customers’ balances have been written off or are credit-impaired at the
reporting date. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are a business
or end-user customer, their geographic location, industry, trading history with the Group and existence of previous financial difficulties.
The Group receives cash payment for large contracts up front in some instances, in addition to contracting with government funded entities which
subsequently carries lower risks.
The Group applies the simplified approach under IFRS 9 and has calculated expected credit losses based on lifetime expected credit losses, taking into
consideration historical credit loss experience and financial factors specific to the debtors and general economic conditions and concluded that no
expected credit loss provision is required as of December 31, 2020 (2019: $0).
25.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk relates to the Group’s ability to meet its cash flow requirements. The Group has a prudent policy to cover its liquidity risks which is focused
on having sufficient cash and cash equivalents available.
25.3 Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group operates internationally, and it is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates. The currency risk arises from future commercial transactions,
recognized assets and liabilities and net investments abroad.
The Group’s policy to manage risk is to initially mitigate the risk using natural hedges (offsetting of receivables and payables) in addition to implementing
investment procedures. Several of the Group’s companies operate in foreign countries and therefore, their net assets are exposed to the risk associated
with translating foreign currencies.
The Group has applied the following significant exchange rates.

Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The net impact from the fluctuation of operational foreign exchange rates amounted to $3,861 thousand (2019: $9,693 thousand).
Sensitivity analysis
The Group only has significant exposure to movement of the sterling (“GBP”) against the United States dollar (“USD”). A reasonably possible
strengthening/weakening of the GPB against the United States dollar (“USD”) at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 would have affected the
measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain
constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases. The fluctuation seen primarily relates to the impacts of Brexit and COVID-19 over the
last two years but is expected to stabilize moving forward.

25.5 Interest rate risk
The interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group does not have any borrowings at floating interest rates that would expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
25.6 Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support
its business and maximise shareholder’s value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in business conditions. No changes were made in the objectives,
policies or processes during the year end December 31, 2020. Capital comprises ordinary share capital, share premium and accumulated losses.

company which is the parent of various telecommunication subsidiaries, for the sale of the Babylon Health Canada Limited business. The entire issued
share capital of Babylon Health Canada Limited was transferred to TELUS for a base price of $1,800 thousand CAD, which has been adjusted for working
capital and net indebtedness, through this transaction. A further $3,500 thousand payment was made by TELUS that was attributable to a partial

forgiven immediately prior to the execution of the SPA. The transaction met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
On April 1 2021, Marcus Zachary DO, OC., an entity that is consolidated by the Babylon Group, entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire
Meritage Medical Network, an independent physician association that also provides management services to various healthcare organizations, based in
Northern California for gross consideration of $30.2 million, or $16.2 million, net of cash acquired. Consideration transferred includes $13.8 million in cash
paid, net of cash acquired, and $2.4 million in warrants at fair value.
Between January 2021 and August 2021, Babylon Holdings Limited invested a further $2,586 thousand in Health Innovators Inc.
Between January 2021 and August 2021, Babylon Acquisition Corp invested a further $5,000 thousand in Higi.
On June 3, 2021, Babylon announced it entered into a definitive merger agreement with Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp (“Alkuri Group”), a special
purpose acquisition company (the “Merger”) following the unanimous approval of the Board of Directors of the Group and Alkuri Group. The transaction
is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to the approval of Alkuri Global’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including
applicable regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to deliver up to $575 million of gross proceeds before transaction costs, including $345
million of cash held in Alkuri Group’s trust account, assuming no redemptions, and $230 million from a private placement. If the transaction is
consummated, the combined company will operate as Babylon and plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
On June 30, 2021, the $70,000 thousand Tranche 2 Notes issued on December 16, 2020 converted into Series C Preferred Shares (See Note 21 for further
details).
On July 15, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a loan agreement with VNV (Cyprus) Limited for $15.0 million. The interest rate on the loan was 14%.
On August 18, 2021, the Group issued $50.0 million in unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (“Unsecured Bonds”), including the non-cash conversion
of $8.0 million in borrowings under the loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The interest rate on the loan
is 10%, with interest payable quarterly. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds can be used for general corporate purposes. The Company utilized
proceeds of $7.2 million from the Unsecured Bonds to settle the remainder of the loan and interest with VNV (Cyprus) Limited. Cash proceeds from the
bond issuance, net of discounts, repayments of borrowings, and transaction expenses, totalled approximately $32.1 million. The Unsecured Bonds have a
one-year term and they can be redeemed by Babylon Holdings at any time. Payment of the bonds is mandatory upon completion of a business
combination or change in control. Babylon Holdings must maintain a minimum cash balance of $10.0 million to comply with financial covenants.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of higi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company), which comprise the
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of higi SH Holdings,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and the results of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting

Principles of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries as noted above. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency
The Canadian Dollar is the functional currency of the Company’s wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Higi Canada. Assets and liabilities of the foreign
subsidiaries whose functional currency are not the United States Dollar (USD) are translated into USD using an exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the year. Equity transactions are translated using historical
exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments have been immaterial to date and are included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement
of operations.
Foreign currency transactions produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A
change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the amount of
functional currency cash flows (cash required) upon settlement of the transaction. Gains and losses for all transactions denominated in a currency other
than the functional currency are recognized in the period incurred and included in operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company defines cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid, short-term investments with a maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or
less.
The Company had a cash balance of $789,208 held in foreign bank accounts as of December 31, 2020. The Company has not experienced any losses in
such accounts and management believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risks.

Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are stated at net invoice amounts. Accounts receivable are subject to collection risk. Gross accounts receivable are reduced for this
risk by the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specifically identified amounts that the Company believes
to be uncollectible. If actual collections experience changes, revisions to the allowance may be required. Any unanticipated change in one of those
customers’ credit worthiness or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur. All amounts deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the
allowance for doubtful accounts in the period that determination is made. Management has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $64,257 as of
December 31, 2020.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The straight-line method is used for computing depreciation and amortization. Costs of maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense when incurred. Provisions for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed using straight-line
methods over the following estimated useful lives or, for leasehold improvements, the lease term if shorter:
Higi stations
3 years
Leasehold improvements
3 - 5 years
Software Development Costs
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) require the capitalization of qualifying computer software costs,
which are incurred during the application development stage. The Company evaluates internal use software development costs to determine if any costs
qualify for capitalization. To date, the Company has determined that due to the iterative nature of the development process of new internal use software,
the development stage is ongoing. As such, the development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred in the consolidated statement of
operations.
Intangible Assets
The Trade name of $156,554 as of December 31, 2020, net of accumulated amortization, is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and is amortized
over 10 years. The patent license of $106,962 as of December 31, 2020, net of accumulated amortization, is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and
is amortized over 10 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount should be evaluated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset in conjunction with its asset group compared to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the
carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value. To date, there have been no such losses.

Deferred Rent Liability
The Company records the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight-line basis and records the difference between rents paid and the straight-
line rent as a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
Revenue Recognition Policy
The Company derives revenues primarily from retail station leases, hosted subscription services, Higi station unit sales and related professional services.
Revenues are recognized when control of these products and services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected
to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the
Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. In some instances, the Company enters into arrangements with multiple distinct
promises that generally include subscriptions, support, installation costs and professional services. Each identified distinct performance obligation is
allocated consideration and accounted for separately. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, contingent fees
or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a
significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract or contracts, with a customer
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
•
Determination of the transaction price
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
•
Recognition of revenue when or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation
Retail Station Lease Revenues
Retail station revenues are comprised of monthly per station fees that provide retail customers with access to a Higi station and connectivity in locations
agreed-upon in the customer’s contractual agreement. Customers gain access to a hosted platform on the kiosk station, along with related support and
updates during the term of the arrangement. The cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) product allows customers to access their daily health metrics
through the Higi platform.
The Company recognizes revenue over-time and applies the “right to invoice” practical expedient on station revenues. As a result, the Company
recognizes revenue at the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer. The amount corresponds directly with the value transferred
to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date, in this case number of active stations. The majority of the Company’s customers are
invoiced on a monthly basis following the month of the delivery of services, typically payable within 30 days and are required to make payments under
standard credit terms. Contracts are generally one year or longer in length and non-cancelable. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in
accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.

Non-Retail Platform & Station Lease Revenues
Non-retail station and platform service revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with Higi stations, connectivity and access to the
Company’s customizable hosted population health services and programs, including on-going data delivery, implementation services and related support
and updates during the term of the arrangement.
Revenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer.
Subscription contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed in advance or monthly in-arrears and non-cancelable. Amounts that have been
invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.
Station Unit Sales
The Company sells Higi stations directly to certain customers. Revenue is recognized at a point-in-time for station unit sales once all obligations under
the terms of delivery of the stations has been completed.
Professional Services Revenues
Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for installation of Higi stations and other implementation costs. Revenue is generally recognized
in the period services are transferred to the customer.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
The Company enters into contracts with its customers that may contain multiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise in a
contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance
obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.
For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if the products or services are often sold separately. The
transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. The Company determines SSP by
considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company’s discounting
practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-
to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. As the Company’s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices
in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.
In certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to
similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices.
Contract Assets and Deferred Revenues
The timing and amount of revenue recognition may differ in certain situations from the billing terms due to the pattern of delivery for each identified
distinct performance obligation. The Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings and deferred revenue
when the billings on a contract
F-102
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020
exceed the revenue recognized. The Company has no recorded contract assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Customer
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are contract liabilities and are recorded as deferred revenue.
Incremental Costs
The Company’s incremental costs of fulfilling a contract primarily consist of costs associated with installation and delivery of Higi stations to customers.
Fulfillment costs are expensed as incurred as installation services are recognized at a point-in-time as a separate distinct performance obligation.
Cost of Revenues
Costs of the SaaS platform primarily consist of the costs of hosting the SaaS product, platform related software and integration fees, connectivity and
maintenance, shipping and installation and depreciation expense associated with the Higi stations. Hosting costs, platform related software and
integration fees are expensed as incurred based upon actual usage. Connectivity and maintenance, shipping and installation costs are expensed as
incurred upon the go-live of the station kiosks at the customer’s locations. Provisions for depreciation of Higi stations are computed using straight-line
methods over the estimated term of the arrangement.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising expense was $6,064 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires all stock-based compensation to
employees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on
the their grant date fair values.
Compensation expense related to awards is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the
award, which is generally the vesting term. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of options
granted. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the number of shares granted and the fair value on the date of grant determined by an
independent third party.
Sales Tax
The Company’s lease and platform based revenues from Higi stations and SaaS contracts may be subject to sales tax in certain states. The Company
charges and collects sales tax, when appropriate, from customers in the United States. Revenues are reported net of such amounts. Collected taxes are
remitted to the appropriate state or local entity on a periodic basis. The Company’s terms and conditions with its customers contain provisions allowing
the Company to bill its customers for sales based tax if it is owed. For jurisdictions where the Company has accrued such estimated liabilities, the actual
liabilities upon final settlement may differ based upon the jurisdictions’ conclusion on the taxability of the Company’s revenue and the Company’s
opportunities to mitigate such liabilities. The Company has accrued an estimated liability of $94,723 as of December 31, 2020. In certain other jurisdictions,
while the Company believes that its revenue is not subject to sales tax, the Company’s position may be challenged by state and local taxing authorities.
No amounts have been recorded related to such situations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

International Taxes
The Company is required to pay a non-resident withholding tax on revenues derived from Canadian based customers. This tax is included in income taxes
on the consolidated statement of operations. Total unpaid non-resident withholding taxes was $85,334 as of December 31, 2020. The Company is
responsible for collecting and remitting a goods and services tax (GST) and harmonized sales tax (HST) on services provided to their customers located in
Canada. Total unpaid GST/HST was $34,031 as of December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that
includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In
accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company classifies all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. When
applicable, interest and penalties incurred on uncertain tax positions are calculated based on guidance from the relevant tax authority and included in
income tax expense.
The Company is subject to the accounting standard for uncertainty in income taxes. The tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in
the consolidated financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.
The Company recognizes the consolidated financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more
likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the
consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized, upon ultimate settlement with the
relevant tax authority. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in income tax expense.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company is subject to the accounting standard for fair value measurements, which provides a framework for measuring, reporting and disclosing fair
value. This applies to all assets and liabilities that are measured, reported and/or disclosed on a fair value basis.
The Company’s short-term financial instruments consist of the following: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts
payable. The carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values based on the instruments’ short-term
nature.
The recorded values of convertible promissory notes, note payable and related party convertible promissory notes approximate their fair values, as
interest approximates market rates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
During February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the
statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term. During 2018, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient, which permits an entity to elect an
optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate land easements that existed or expired before the entity’s adoption of Topic 842 and that were not
previously accounted for under ASC 840; ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which addresses narrow aspects of the
guidance originally issued in ASU No. 2016- 02; ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, which provides entities with an additional (and optional) transition
method whereby an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption and also provides lessors with a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, to not separate
nonlease components from the associated lease component and, instead, to account for those components as a single component; and ASU No. 2018-20,
Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, which addresses sales and other similar taxes collected from lessees, certain lessor costs and the recognition of
variable payments for contracts with lease and nonlease components. Topic 842 (as amended) is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the
effect that Topic 842 (as amended) will have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
During August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
That Is a Service Contract. ASU No. 2018-15 requires an entity (customer) in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance of
Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The
amendments also require the entity (customer) to expense the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over
the term of the hosting arrangement and apply the existing impairment guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to the capitalized implementation costs as if the costs
were long-lived assets. Lastly, the amendment addresses the presentation of expenses in the statement of income, payments in the statement of cash
flows and capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position. ASU No. 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2020 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing
the effect that ASU No. 2018-15 will have on its consolidated results of operation, financial position and cash flows.

Paycheck Protection Program
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread
throughout the United States and rest of the world. This has adversely impacted global economic activity and contributed to significant declines and
volatility in financial markets.
On March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) was enacted. The
CARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic
F-106

stimulus package, which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions applicable to U.S. income tax. Some of these tax provisions are
expected to be effective retroactively for years ending before the date of enactment. The Company is currently evaluating the implications of the Act and
its impact on the financial statements.
In response to the pandemic, on April 6, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $1,000,400 under the Paycheck Protection Program
(PPP) which was established as part of the CARES Act and is administered through the Small Business Administration (SBA). The PPP provides loans to
qualifying businesses in amounts up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll expenses and was designed to provide a direct financial incentive for
qualifying businesses to keep their workforce employed during the Coronavirus crisis. PPP loans are uncollateralized and guaranteed by the SBA and are
forgivable after a “covered period” (eight or twenty-four weeks) as long as the borrower maintains its payroll levels and uses the loan proceeds for
eligible expenses, including payroll, benefits, mortgage interest, rent and utilities. The forgiveness amount will be reduced if the borrower terminates
employees or reduces salaries and wages more than 25 percent during the covered period. Any unforgiven portion is payable over two years if issued
before or five years if issued after, June 5, 2020 at an interest rate of one percent with payments deferred until the SBA remits the borrower’s loan
forgiveness amount to the lender or, if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness, ten months after the end of the covered period. PPP loan terms
provide for customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties and insolvency events and may be
accelerated upon the occurrence of one or more of these events of default. Additionally, PPP loan terms do not include prepayment penalties.
The Company met the PPP’s loan forgiveness requirements and therefore, applied for forgiveness during November of 2020. On April 1, 2021, the
Company received legal release from the SBA and therefore, will record the amount forgiven, $1,000,400, as forgiveness income within the other income
section in its 2021 statement of operations.
The SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP loan, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. In accordance with the
CARES Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their PPP loan documentation for six years after the PPP loan was forgiven or repaid in full and to
provide that documentation to the SBA upon request.

Promissory Notes
Senior Secured Promissory Notes issued October 2016
In October 2016, the Company issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $10,000,000 to an existing investor (the Senior Note). Pursuant to a

and (ii) thereafter an amount equal to the sum of LIBOR plus 7.50 percent per annum if principal payments commence not later than November 1,
2019 or LIBOR plus 10.00 percent per annum if principal payments are not commenced on November 1, 2019. Interest is paid monthly with payments
due on the 15th day of following month it is earned.

The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which generally requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and
liabilities based on the expected future income tax consequences of events that have previously been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements or tax returns. The principal items which cause the Company’s effective tax rate to vary from the U.S. statutory rate are state income taxes,
permanent items consisting primarily of goodwill and net operating loss carryforward utilization.
The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of December 31, 2020:

At December 31, 2020, the Company has federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $65,241,172. A portion of the federal net
operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031. At December 31, 2020, the Company has state NOL carryforwards of $21,934,791. The state NOL
carryforwards begin to expire in 2029.
Federal and state NOL carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that
could occur in the future, as required by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as well as similar state provisions. In general, an “ownership change” as
defined by the IRC results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50
percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. Since the Company’s formation, the Company has
raised capital through the issuance of capital stock which may have resulted in an ownership change or could result in an ownership change in the future
upon subsequent disposition. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. The Company has established a valuation allowance against its total deferred tax assets as there is uncertainty the assets
may not be utilized before expiration. The allowance is subject to change based upon the Company’s continued operating performance.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had no uncertain tax benefits. The Company’s estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax positions is
subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions to
determine if it is

in the provision for income taxes.

authorities for the years 2016 through 2020. There are no pending examinations in any jurisdiction.

Stock-Based Compensation
Incentive Stock Options
On June 26, 2018, the Company’s Board amended the original higi SH Holdings, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the Option Plan) after the recapitalization and
reorganization. The purpose of the Option Plan is to enable the Company to attract, retain, reward and motivate individuals by providing them with an
opportunity to acquire and increase proprietary interest in the Company and to incentivize them to expend maximum effort for the growth and success of
the Company. The Option Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity-
based awards to its employees, consultants, service providers and directors for up to 3,169,982 shares of common stock. On March 15, 2020, the Board
approved an additional 13,404,722 shares of common stock of the Company for a total of 16,574,704 shares reserved for issuance under the Option Plan.
The Company has granted 7,310,746 Non-Voting Common Units under Incentive Unit Agreements (IUA’s or options) through December 31, 2020. The
IUAs are designed to serve as an incentive for attracting and retaining employees, officers, investors and advisors. The Company determines the grant
and vesting terms as of the grant date. The exercise price of the options shall be fixed by the Board and stated in the respective IUA, provided that the
exercise price of the shares of common stock subject to such option may not be less than fair market value of the common stock on the grant date or if
greater, the par value of the common stock. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the Option Plan to an employee who at the time of
grant is a holder of at least 10 percent of total company stock and to any other employee must be equal to at least 110 percent and 100 percent,
respectively, of the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted under the
Option Plan and all rights to purchase common stock thereunder shall terminate no later than the 10th anniversary of the grant date of such options or on
such earlier date as may be stated in the IUA relating to such option.

vesting on the first anniversary of the commencement date and the remaining shares vesting ratably each month until the 48th month anniversary. No

Performance-Based Stock Warrants

and reorganization. The performance-based warrants become exercisable upon achievement of certain milestones as described in the warrant document.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
The Company estimated the fair value of each option award utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following
table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the industry. The expected term of options granted is based on the contractual expiration date
of the options. The risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The following assumptions were used for options granted during the year ended December
31, 2020:
Expected volatility
100 percent
Expected dividends
N/A
Expected life of option (in years)
6.25
Risk-free interest rate
0.50 percent
The amount charged to stock compensation expense was $60,463 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there was $29,495 of
unrecognized compensation cost related to service-based non-vested stock options granted under the Option Plan. The unrecognized compensation cost
is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of three years.
Stock Option Repricing
In November 2020, the Board of Directors approved a common stock option repricing program whereby previously granted and unexercised options held
by current employees with exercise prices above $0.01 per share were repriced to $0.01 per share, which represented the per share fair value of the
common stock as of the date of the repricing. There was no other modification to the vesting schedule of the previously issued options. As a result,
542,136 unexercised options originally granted to purchase common stock were repriced under this program.
The Company treated the repricing as a modification of the original awards and calculated compensation costs for the difference between the fair value of
the modified award and the fair value of the original award on the modification date. The repricing did not result in incremental stock-based compensation
expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. Expense related to vested shares was expensed on the repricing date and expense related to unvested
shares is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of such stock options.
12.
Retirement Plan
The Company offers a 401(k) plan to employees of the Company. The Company may match contributions at its discretion. There were no matching
contributions made by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020.

commitment no later than July 1, 2021 and an additional $4,000,000 by March 31, 2022. On July 1, 2021 the Company agreed to new terms with the investor
whereas the investor is required to pay the licensing revenue commitment in two tranches of $3,000,000 within 90 days and 120 days. At any time, the
Company may request all or part of the licensing fee to be paid by the investor within 5 business days. At any time, the Company may request all or part
of the licensing fee to paid by the investor within 5 business days. The Company believes that, as a result, it currently has sufficient cash and financing
commitments to meet its funding requirements for at least one year from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp. (formerly known as “Ark Global Acquisition Corp.”) (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2020, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder’s equity and cash flows for the period from December
1, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the period from December 1, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the
“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020
NOTE 1 — DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp. (formerly known as Ark Global Acquisition Corp.) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December
1, 2020. On March 5, 2021, Alkuri filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change its corporate name from Ark Global Acquisition
Corp. to Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp., effective March 8, 2021. Alkuri was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).
Alkuri is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, Alkuri is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth
companies.
As of December 31, 2020, Alkuri had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from December 1, 2020 (inception) through
December 31, 2020 relates to Alkuri’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”). Alkuri will not generate any operating
revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. Alkuri will generate non-operating income on cash and cash
equivalents in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.
The registration statement for Alkuri’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 4, 2021. On February 9, 2021, Alkuri consummated
the Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public
Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of $345,000,000, which is described in Note 3.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, Alkuri consummated the sale of 5,933,333 warrants (each, a “Private Placement
Warrant” and, collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Ark Sponsor LLC
(the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000, which is described in Note 4.
Transaction costs amounted to $19,500,194, consisting of $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $525,194 of
other offering costs.
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, an amount of $345,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a Trust Account, invested in U.S. government
securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended
investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by Alkuri, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the
distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to Alkuri’s stockholders, as described below, except that the interest earned on the Trust Account can be
released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligation.
Alkuri’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of
the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business
Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value
equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest
earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. Alkuri intends to complete a Business
Combination if the

distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to Alkuri’s stockholders, as described below, except that the interest earned on the Trust Account can be
released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligation.
Alkuri’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of
the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business

post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling
interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Alkuri will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their
Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business
Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether Alkuri will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a
tender offer will be made by Alkuri, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of
the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust
Account and not previously released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business
Combination with respect to Alkuri’s warrants.
Alkuri will proceed with a Business Combination only if Alkuri has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such
consummation of a Business Combination and, if Alkuri seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business
Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and Alkuri does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, Alkuri will,
pursuant to its Charter (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however,
stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or Alkuri decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, Alkuri will
offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If Alkuri seeks
approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after
the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares
irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or don’t vote at all.
Notwithstanding the above, if Alkuri seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such
stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)),
will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of
Alkuri.
The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the
completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if Alkuri fails to complete a Business
Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Charter (i) to modify the
substance or timing of Alkuri’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with Alkuri’s initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public
Shares if Alkuri does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, unless Alkuri provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any
such amendment.
Alkuri will have until February 9, 2023 to complete a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). If Alkuri is unable to complete a Business
Combination within the Combination Period, Alkuri will (i) cease all

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the
Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as
stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such
redemption, subject to the approval of Alkuri’s remaining stockholders and Alkuri’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to
Alkuri’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights
or liquidating distributions with respect to Alkuri’s warrants, which will expire worthless if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within the
Combination Period.
The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have
agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event Alkuri does not complete a
Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account
that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets
remaining available for distribution will be less than the Proposed Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).
In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to Alkuri if and to the extent any claims by a third
party for services rendered or products sold to Alkuri, or a prospective target business with which Alkuri has discussed entering into a transaction
agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the
Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest
which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all
rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under Alkuri’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public Offering
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to
have all vendors, service providers (except Alkuri’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with
which Alkuri does business, execute agreements with Alkuri waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust
Account.
Liquidity and Management’s Plan
Prior to the completion of the initial public offering, Alkuri lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which
is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statement. The Company has since competed its Initial Public Offering at which time
capital in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to Alkuri for general working capital
purposes. On March 26, 2021, Alkuri’s cash position is approximately $315,000. On

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020
March 25, 2021, our Sponsor committed to provide us with an aggregate of $650,000 in loans. The loans, if issued, will be non-interest bearing, unsecured
and will be repaid upon the consummation of a Business Combination. If Alkuri does not consummate a business combination, all amounts loaned to
Alkuri will be forgiven except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the Trust Account to repay such loans. Accordingly, management has
since reevaluated Alkuri’s liquidity and financial condition and determined that sufficient capital exists to sustain operations through for a reasonable
period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements and therefore substantial doubt has been alleviated.
Risks and Uncertainties
Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus
could have a negative effect on Alkuri’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily
determinable as of the date of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.
NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other
public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered
public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Alkuri’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a
condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,
could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020.
Deferred Offering Costs
Deferred offering costs consisted of legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that were directly related to the
Initial Public Offering. On February 9, 2021, offering costs amounting to $19,500,194 were charged to stockholders’ equity upon the completion of the
Initial Public Offering (see Note 1). As of December 31, 2020, there were $247,735 of deferred offering costs recorded in the accompanying balance sheet.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The Company complies with the accounting and
reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income
taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that
will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax
expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020. The Company is currently
not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.
The provision for income taxes was deemed to be immaterial as of December 31, 2020.
Net Loss Per Common Share
Net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares
of Class B common stock that are subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriter (see Note 5). At
December 31, 2020, Alkuri did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock
and then share in the earnings of Alkuri. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject Alkuri to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at
times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company had not experienced losses on this account and management
believes Alkuri is not exposed to significant risks on such account.

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of Alkuri’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,”
approximates the carrying amounts represented in Alkuri’s balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on Alkuri’s financial statements.
NOTE 3 — INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, Alkuri sold 34,500,000 Units, which includes a full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option
in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Alkuri’s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par
value, and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common
stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7).
NOTE 4 — PRIVATE PLACEMENT
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,933,333 Private Placement Warrants at a
price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant ($8,900,000 in the aggregate), in a private placement. Each Private Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase
one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. $6,900,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added
to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account and $2,000,000 of proceeds were held outside of the trust to pay certain
offering costs and for use as working capital. If Alkuri does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the
sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the
Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.
NOTE 5 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Founder Shares
On December 17, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000 for the purchase of 7,187,500 shares of Class B common stock Founder Shares. On February 4,
2021, Alkuri effected a 1.2-for-1 stock split of its Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder
Shares included an aggregate of up to 1,125,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment was not
exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of Alkuri’s issued and outstanding shares after the
Initial Public Offering. As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option on February 9, 2021, no Founder Shares are
currently subject to forfeiture.
The Sponsor has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of:
(1) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (2) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of Alkuri’s
Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations,

recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y)
the date on which Alkuri completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of Alkuri’s stockholders
having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.
Advances from Related Party
The Sponsor paid for certain costs ($4,220 as of December 31, 2020) on behalf of Alkuri in connection with its formation and the Initial Public
Offering. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2020 was repaid prior to the closing of the Initial Public Offering. During 2021, the Sponsor made
additional advances of $1,194,375 on behalf of Alkuri, these additional advances were repaid subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public Offering on
February 10, 2021.
Administrative Support Agreement
The Company agreed, commencing on February 4, 2021 through the earlier of Alkuri’s consummation of a Business Combination or its liquidation,
to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.
Promissory Note — Related Party
On December 17, 2020, the Sponsor loaned Alkuri an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to
a promissory note (the “Note”). The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the completion of the Initial Public
Offering. As of December 31, 2020, Alkuri had $300,000 outstanding under the Note which was repaid subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public
Offering on February 10, 2021.
Related Party Loans
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of Alkuri’s
directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan Alkuri funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If Alkuri completes a Business
Combination, Alkuri would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to Alkuri. Otherwise, the Working Capital
Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, Alkuri may use a
portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to
repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without
interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.
NOTE 6 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Registration Rights
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 4, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and
any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of
the Private Placement Warrants

and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will have registration rights to
require Alkuri to register a sale of any of the securities held by them. These holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands,
excluding short form registration demands, that Alkuri register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders will have
“piggy-back” registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us, subject to certain limitations. The registration rights
agreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering Alkuri’s securities. The
Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Underwriting Agreement
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $12,075,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the
underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that Alkuri completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the
underwriting agreement.
NOTE 7—STOCKHOLDER’S EQUITY
Preferred Stock—The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock. At December 31, 2020, there were no
shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.
Class A Common Stock—The Company is authorized to issue up to 380,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value common stock. Holders of
Alkuri’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2020, there were no Class A common stock issued and outstanding
Class B Common Stock — The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Class B, $0.0001 par value common stock. Holders of
Alkuri’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2020, there were 8,625,000 shares of Class B common stock issued and
outstanding.
Only holders of the Class B common stock have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of Class A
common stock and holders of Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders except as
required by law.
The shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination on a
one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed
issued in connection with a Business Combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will
equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of
the Initial Public Offering, plus the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of
any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Alkuri in connection with or in relation to the consummation of a Business
Combination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common
stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or
directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one for one basis.
The Company cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of the Class B common stock at the time of any future issuance would agree
to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio.

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020
Warrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public
Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months
from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon
redemption or liquidation.
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no
obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A common
stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to Alkuri satisfying its
obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and Alkuri will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon
exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the
securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants.
The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of a Business Combination,
Alkuri will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon
exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A
common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A
common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination or within a
specified period following the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when Alkuri shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis”
pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act; provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another
exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.
Redemption of Warrants When the Price per share of Class A common stock Equals or Exceeds $18.00—Once the warrants become exercisable,
Alkuri may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;
•
upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and
•
if, and only if, the reported closing price of the shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing
after the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before Alkuri sends to the notice of redemption to the warrant
holders.
If and when the warrants become redeemable by Alkuri, Alkuri may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the
underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.
Redemption of Warrants When the Price per share of Class A common stock Equals or Exceeds $10.00— Once the warrants become
exercisable, Alkuri may redeem the outstanding warrants:
•
in whole and not in part;
F-133
Table of Contents
ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020
•
at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their
warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares based on the redemption date and the fair market value
of the shares of Class A common stock;
•
if, and only if, the closing price of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per public share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days
within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before Alkuri sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
•
if the closing price of Class A common stock for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before Alkuri
send notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted), the Private Placement Warrants must also be
concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.
The exercise price and number of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances
including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as
described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Class A common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no
event will Alkuri be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If Alkuri is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period
and Alkuri liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public
Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from Alkuri’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants.
Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.
In addition, if (x) Alkuri issues additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with
the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A common stock (with such
issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by Alkuri’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or
its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly
Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon,
available for the funding of Alkuri’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of
redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of Alkuri’s common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day
prior to the day on which Alkuri consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price
of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per
share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly
Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the
Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private
Placement Warrants and the common shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable
until 30 days after the completion of a business combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be
exercisable on a cashless basis and will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private
Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be
redeemable by Alkuri and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December 1, 2020. The Company was
formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business
combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the
Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
As of June 30, 2021, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period ending June 30, 2021 relates to the Company’s
formation, the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a
target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business
Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income on cash and cash equivalents in the form of interest income from the
proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.
The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 4, 2021. On February 9, 2021, the Company
consummated the Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units
sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at $10.00 per
Unit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000, which is described in Note 3.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 5,933,333 warrants (each, a “Private Placement
Warrant” and, collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Ark Sponsors
LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000, which is described in Note 4.
Transaction costs amounted to $19,500,194, consisting of $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $525,194 of
other offering costs.
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, an amount of $345,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”),
invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or
less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a
Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s stockholders, as described below, except that the
interest earned on the Trust Account can be released to the Company to pay its tax obligation.
The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the
sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a
Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair
market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable
on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company intends to
complete a Business

(UNAUDITED)
Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion
of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business
Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or
conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a
pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds
held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion
of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants.
The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon
such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the
Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other
reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer
documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the
Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks approval in connection with a Business
Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of
approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or
against the proposed transaction or don’t vote at all.
Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant
to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such
stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the
Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.
The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the
completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business
Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s
initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any
other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the
opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.
The Company will have until February 9, 2023 to complete a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). If the Company is unable to
complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the
F-141
Table of Contents
ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)
Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including
interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of
interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public
stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other
applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the
Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.
The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The
underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company
does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in
the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share
value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Proposed Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).
In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a
third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into
a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share
held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any
and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public
Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an
executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party
claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by
endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses
or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or
to monies held in the Trust Account.
Merger Agreement
On June 3, 2021, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among the Company, Babylon Holdings Limited, Liberty USA
Merger Sub, Inc. and, solely for purposes of Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement, each of Alkuri Sponsors LLC and Dr. Ali Parsadoust. The Merger
Agreement was unanimously approved by the Company’s board of directors on June 2, 2021. If the Merger Agreement is
F-142

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)
approved by the Company’s shareholders, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated, Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Babylon. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, each share of Company common stock (excluding shares held in treasury by the Company) will be automatically converted into the right to
receive one (1) Class A ordinary shares (the “Pubco Class A Shares”) of Pubco.
The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon at $3.515 billion, and prior to the closing
of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), each outstanding share of Babylon will be reclassified into Pubco Class A Shares, other than the existing
Babylon Class A Shares, which will be reclassified as Class B ordinary shares (the “Pubco Class B Shares”) of Pubco. As a result of the reclassification,
each outstanding Pubco Class A Share and Pubco Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00 (based on the $3.515
billion equity value of Babylon). At the Closing, the Pubco Class B shares will be held by Dr. Ali Parasdoust, ALP Partners Limited, Parsa Family
Foundation (collectively, the “Founder”) or a founder permitted transferee. The Pubco Class B shares will have the same economic terms as the Pubco
Class A shares, but the Pubco Class B shares will have 15 votes per share (while each Pubco Class A Share will have 1 vote per share).
In addition, in connection with the Closing, the Company will issue at the closing (i) to the Founder, 38,800,000 Pubco Class B Shares (the “Stockholder
Earnout Shares”) and (ii) to the Sponsor, 1,293,750 Pubco Class A shares that the Sponsor would otherwise receive as consideration for the Merger (the
“Sponsor Earnout Shares” and together with the Stockholder Earnout Shares, the “Earnout Shares”). The Earnout Shares will be subject to milestones
(based on the achievement of certain price targets of Pubco Class A shares following the Closing). In the event such milestones are not met, all of the
Earnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Pubco which Pubco can redeem for $1.00.
Subscription Agreements
Additionally, the Company and Babylon entered into subscription agreements, each dated as of June 3, 2021, with certain investors, pursuant to
which, among other things, Babylon agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 23,000,000
Pubco Class A shares for $10 per share. The PIPE Investment will be consummated immediately prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements, including the consummation of the Business
Combination.
Entities affiliated with the Sponsor have agreed to purchase 1,300,000 Pubco Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on
substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. Entities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust have agreed to purchase 200,000 Pubco
Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. Entities affiliated with
VNV Global AB and Kinnevik AB have each agreed to purchase 500,000 Pubco Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the
same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.
As of the date hereof, issuance or sale of the Pubco Class A Shares in connection with the Subscription Agreements has not been registered under
the Securities Act. The Company has agreed, within 15 calendar days of Closing to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of such
Pubco Class A Shares and will use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but
in any event no later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) calendar days (or ninety (90) calendar days if the SEC notifies the Company that it will “review” the
registration statement) following the Closing and
F-143
Table of Contents
ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2021
(UNAUDITED)
(ii) the tenth (10th) business day after the date the Company is notified (in writing) by the SEC that the registration statement will not be “reviewed” or
will not be subject to further review.
Going Concern Consideration
At June 30, 2021, we have $70,821 in its operating bank accounts, $345,022,618 in securities held in the Trust Account, to be for a Business
Combination or to repurchase or redeem its ordinary shares in connection therewith and working capital of ($3,126,669).
Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and
evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the
target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating, and consummating the Business Combination.
If the Business Combination is not consummated, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its
Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the
Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working
capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be
required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the
pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through
one year from the date of these financial statements if a Business Combination is not consummated. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern.
Risks and Uncertainties
Management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus
could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not
readily determinable as of the date of the financial statement. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been
condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information
and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the
F-144
Table of Contents
ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2021
(UNAUDITED)
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the period ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the Company’s prospectus for its Initial Public Offering as filed with the SEC on February 9, 2021. The interim results for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021 or for any
future periods.
Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other
public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered
public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a
class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act
provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company,
can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s
financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of
using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a
condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,
could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
Company did not have any cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account
At June 30, 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds which are invested primarily in U.S.
Treasury securities. Interest income is recognized when earned. The Company’s portfolio of marketable securities is comprised solely of U.S. government
securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended
investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4)
of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $345 million was placed in the
Trust Account and invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. All of the Company’s investments held in the Trust
Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains
and losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in
Trust Account in the accompanying statement of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in Trust Account are determined using
available market information.
Offering Costs associated with the Initial Public Offering
The Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) Topic 5A—“Expenses of
Offering”. Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date. Offering costs are allocated to
the separable financial instruments issued in the IPO based on a relative fair value basis compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs associated
with warrant liabilities is expensed, and offering costs associated with the Class A ordinary share are charged to the shareholders’ equity. Accordingly, as
of June 30, 2021, offering costs in the aggregate of $18,855,156 have been charged to shareholders’ equity and $645,038 of offering costs associated with
warrant and forward purchase unit issuance cost has been expensed on the Company’s statement of operations.
Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
The Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified
as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights
that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control)
is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A common stock features
certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly,
at June 30, 2021, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’
equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.
Warrant Liability
The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific
terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting
F-146

(UNAUDITED)
Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives
and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the
definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including
whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which
requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the
warrants are outstanding.
For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of
additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are
required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the
warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using a Modified Black
Scholes approach which includes a Monte Carlo simulation (see Note 9).
Income Taxes
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Company is
currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is
subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 due to the valuation allowance recorded on the Company’s net operating losses and permanent differences.
Net loss per Common Share
Net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,
excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and
private placement to purchase an aggregate of 14,558,333 shares in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants are
contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.
The Company’s statement of operations includes a presentation of loss per share for common stock subject to possible redemption in a manner
similar to the two-class method of loss per share. Net loss per common share,

basic and diluted, for Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is calculated by dividing the proportionate share of loss on marketable
securities held by the Trust Account by the weighted average number of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption outstanding since
original issuance.
Net loss per share, basic and diluted, for non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss, adjusted for loss on marketable
securities attributable to Class A common stock subject to possible redemption, by the weighted average number of non-redeemable common stock
outstanding for the period.
Non-redeemable common stock includes Founder Shares and non-redeemable shares of common stock as these shares do not have any redemption
features. Non-redeemable common stock participates in the income or loss on marketable securities based on non-redeemable shares’ proportionate
interest.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution,
which, at times may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,”
approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
•
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;
•
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices
for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
•
Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are
unobservable.
In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those
instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the
derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value
reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as
liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current
based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company’s condensed financial statements.

In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06- Contracts in Entity’s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that
require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception
guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for
convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per
share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022 and
should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently
assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 34,500,000 Units, which includes a full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment
option in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock,
$0.0001 par value, and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A
common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment (see Note 8).
NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,933,333 Private Placement Warrants at a
price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant ($8,900,000 in the aggregate), in a private placement. Each Private Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase
one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net
proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination
Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements
of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.
NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Founder Shares
On December 17, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000 for the purchase of 7,187,500 shares of Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”). On
February 4, 2021, the Company effected a 1.2-for-1 stock split of its Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares
outstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 1,125,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’
over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and
outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option on February 9,
2021, no Founder Shares are currently subject to forfeiture.
The Sponsor has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of:
(1) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the
Company’s Class A common

stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading
days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a
liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their
shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.
Due from Sponsor
At the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants in the
amount of $2,000,000 was due to the Company to be held outside of the Trust Account for working capital purposes. Such amount was paid by the
Sponsor to the Company on February 10, 2021.
Advances from Related Party
As of February 9, 2021, the Sponsor paid for certain offering costs on behalf of the Company in connection with the Initial Public Offering. As of
June 30, 2021, the Company had no outstanding advances from the Sponsor. The outstanding balance under these advances was repaid subsequent to
the closing of the Initial Public Offering, on February 10, 2021.
Sponsor Commitment
On May 12, 2021, our Sponsor committed to provide us with an aggregate of $650,000 in loans through May 31, 2022. The loans, if issued, will be
non-interest bearing, unsecured and will be repaid upon the consummation of an initial business combination. If the Company does not consummate an
initial business combination, all amounts loaned to the Company will be forgiven except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the Trust
Account to repay such loans.
Administrative Services Agreement
The Company agreed, commencing on February 4, 2021 through the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a Business Combination or its
liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred and paid $20,000 and $50,000 in fees for these services respectively.
Promissory Note—Related Party
On December 17, 2020, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public
Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Note”). The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the
completion of the Initial Public Offering. As of February 9, 2021, the Company had $300,000 outstanding under the Note. The outstanding balance under
the Note of $300,000 was repaid subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public Offering, on February 10, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, there was no balance
outstanding under the Promissory Note.
Related Party Loans
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the
Company’s directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan the

Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the
Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only
out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held
outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital
Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s
discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.50
per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no
outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.
NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS
Registration Rights
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 4, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and
any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of
the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares)
will have registration rights to require the Company to register a sale of any of the securities held by them. These holders of these securities will be
entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities for sale under the Securities
Act. In addition, these holders will have “piggy-back” registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us, subject to
certain limitations. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in
registering the Company’s securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Underwriting Agreement
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $ 12,075,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the
underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of
the underwriting agreement.
NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Preferred Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.
Class A Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue up to 380,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value common stock. Holders of the
Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were 4,167,156 and 0 shares,
respectively, of Class A common stock issued and outstanding, excluding 30,332,844 and 0 shares, respectively, of Class A common stock subject to
possible redemption.
Class B Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Class B, $0.0001 par value common stock. Holders of the
Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were 8,625,000 shares of Class B
common stock issued and outstanding, respectively.

Only holders of the Class B common stock have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of Class A
common stock and holders of Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders except as
required by law.
The shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination on a
one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed
issued in connection with a Business Combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will
equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of
the Initial Public Offering, plus the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of
any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of a Business
Combination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common
stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or
directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one for one basis.
The Company cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of the Class B common stock at the time of any future issuance would agree
to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio.
NOTE 8. WARRANT LIABILITY
Warrants - Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public
Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months
from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon
redemption or liquidation.
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no
obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A common
stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its
obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable, and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock
upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt
under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants.
The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the
Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable
upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of
Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of
Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination or
within a specified period following the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an

provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a
cashless basis.
Redemption of Warrants When the Price per share of Class A common stock Equals or Exceeds $18.00 - Once the warrants become exercisable,
the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;
•
upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and
•
if, and only if, the reported closing price of the shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing
after the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends to the notice of redemption to the warrant
holders.
Redemption of Warrants When the Price per share of Class A common stock Equals or Exceeds $10.00 - Once the warrants become exercisable,
the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their
warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares based on the redemption date and the fair market value
of the shares of Class A common stock;
•
if, and only if, the closing price of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per public share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days
within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
•
if the closing price of Class A common stock for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the
Company send notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted), the Private Placement Warrants must
also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.
In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in
connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A common
stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such
issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to
such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds,
and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business
Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 20 trading day period
starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is
below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and
the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will

be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption
trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private
Placement Warrants and the common shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable, or salable
until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be
exercisable on a cashless basis and will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private
Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be
redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting
period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in
connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs
(market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants
would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and
unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:
Level 1:
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which
transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
basis.
Level 2:
Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar
assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability.
At June 30, 2021, assets held in the Trust Account were comprised of $345,022,618 in money market funds which are primarily invested in U.S.
Treasury securities. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company did not withdraw any interest income from the Trust Account.

The Warrants are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Public Warrants were initially valued using Modified Black Scholes model which
includes a Monte Carlo simulation. As of June 30, 2021, the Public Warrants were valued using the instrument’s publicly listed trading price as of the
balance sheet date, which is considered to be a Level 1 measurement due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market.
The Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Modified Black Scholes Model which includes a Monte Carlo simulation, which is considered
to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is the
expected volatility of our common stock. The expected volatility of the Company’s common stock was determined based on the implied volatility of the
Public Warrants.
The key inputs into the Monte Carlo simulation model for the Public Warrants and the Black-Scholes-Merton model for the Private Placement
Warrants were as follows:

Corporate information
Babylon Holdings Limited (the “Company”) is a company limited by shares and is incorporated, registered and domiciled in Jersey. The address of the
registered office is 31 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3QA.
Babylon Holdings Limited is a digital health company engaged in developing affordable healthcare services accessible to consumers on digital devices
platforms and providing technology solutions to medical professionals by automating routine tasks for the care of patients. It also uses its technology to
step in early and help consumers become more informed about diseases, so they can make informed decisions and stay healthier longer. Babylon
combines cutting edge artificial intelligence (“AI”) and broader technologies with the best human expertise to re-engineer a better model of healthcare.
On June 3, 2021, Babylon announced it entered into a definitive merger agreement with Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp (“Alkuri Group”), a special
purpose acquisition company (the “Merger”) following the unanimous approval of the Board of Directors of the Group and Alkuri Group. The transaction
is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to the approval of Alkuri Global’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including
applicable regulatory approvals. If the transaction is consummated, the combined company will operate as Babylon and plans to trade on the New York
stock exchange.
2.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
These condensed unaudited consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 (“Interim Financial Statements”) have been
prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the IASB, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s last annual
consolidated financial statements as at and for year ended December 31, 2020 (“last annual financial statements”). They do not include all of the
information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Standards. However selected explanatory notes are
included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s consolidated financial position and
consolidated performance since the last annual financial statements. These condensed unaudited consolidated interim financial statements were
authorized for issue on September 15, 2021.
Going concern
The Group incurred a loss for the six-month period ending June 30, 2021 of $75,789 thousand (2020: loss of $89,283 thousand), and operating cash
outflows of $19,466 thousand (2020: $87,391 thousand). As of June 30, 2021, the Group had a net asset position of $58,020 thousand (2020: $48,359
thousand). The Group has financed its operations principally through issuances of debt and equity securities and has a strong record of fundraising,
evidenced by its successful Series C raise, execution of a $200,000 thousand Convertible Loan Note agreement and the issuance of $50,000 thousand in
unsecured bonds in August 2021. The Group requires significant cash resources to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, increase
headcount, make capital expenditures (including those related to product development), and expand our business through acquisitions.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the directors consider to be appropriate for the following reasons.
The directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements which indicate that,
taking account of reasonably possible downsides, the Group will have
F-9Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
sufficient funds through injections of further investment capital in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due for that period (the going concern period).
Based upon the forecasts, the directors are expecting to consummate the Merger and believe that the capital raised will be sufficient to provide adequate
funding to service the Group’s obligations, meet liquidity needs and fund necessary capital expenditures through the going concern period. In the event
that the Group is unable to consummate the Merger, the directors believe that additional funding will be required to be sought through public or private
equity or debt financings to continue operations.
At June 30, 2021, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $42,381 thousand (2020: $101,757 thousand). The Group has long term debt obligations that
mature in August 2022 for $50,000 thousand (Note 19).
While there is no assurance that the Merger will be consummated or, in the event that the Merger is not consummated, that additional funds are available
on acceptable terms, the directors believe that they will be successful in raising the additional capital needed to meet working capital and capital
expenditure requirements during the going concern period. As noted in Note 1, the Group has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Alkuri
Global Acquisition Corp. The Group expects the Merger will be consummated in the second half of 2021 to deliver a minimum amount of $230,000
thousand, which would provide sufficient additional capital to continue operations over the going concern period.
However, the above indicates that there are material uncertainties (ability to fund raise further capital in the short term) related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, to continue realizing its assets and discharging its
liabilities in the normal course of business.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. To determine
whether the Group controls an entity, status of voting or similar rights, contractual arrangements and other specific factors are considered. Subsidiaries
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on which that control ceases.
The Group holds certain rights in the form of purchase options to acquire additional equity interests in entities that it has an existing shareholding in.
These rights are assessed as either substantive or protective in nature to conclude whether the Group exercises control over the entity. This assessment
requires judgement relating to both the barriers that may prevent, and the extent to which the Group would benefit from, exercise of those rights and
determines whether the Group should consolidate the entity.
In addition, the Company consolidates certain professional service corporations (“PCs”) which are owned, directly or indirectly, and operated by
appropriately licensed physicians. The Company maintains control of these PCs through contractual arrangements, which can include service
agreements, financing agreements, equity transfer restriction agreements, and employment agreements, or a combination thereof, which are primarily
established during the formation of the PCs. At inception, the contractual framework established between the Group and the PCs provides the Group with
the power to direct the relevant activities in the conduct of the PC’s
F-10
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
non-clinical administrative and other non-clinical business activities. The physicians employed by the PC are exclusively in control of, and responsible
for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for their patients. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group
assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process and whether the acquired set has
the ability to produce outputs. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets
acquired.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between the Group’s companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Other
Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Changes in the Group’s interest in
a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s
share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until
the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying
amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or has made payments on behalf of an investee.
Reclassifications
In 2020, following the start of the VBC (Value-Based Care) revenue stream, management reviewed the presentation of the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss and considered whether it continued to provide relevant and reliable information to stakeholders. It was concluded that there should be an
update to how certain expenses were classified and therefore the Group has changed its accounting policy for expense classifications. Previously, the
Group had disclosed Depreciation and Amortization as a separate expense category, whereas now Depreciation and Amortization costs are allocated to
their relevant function.
In addition, in preparing these financial statements, the Group elected to separately present costs of revenue relating to Platform and application
expenses including amortization and impairment and Research and Development expenses excluding amortization and impairment in its Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss. The elective disaggregated presentation of amounts previously classified as Research & Development and Technology
expenses was applied retrospectively to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
With the exception of the change in presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, these elective changes had no impact on the Group’s
Loss for the period or to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.
Change in accounting policies
R&D tax credits claimed and reimbursed through the U.K. research and development expenditure credit scheme (the “RDEC Scheme”) are recognized
gross as a deferred income grant liability on the balance sheet and as a

reduction to Platform and application expenses over the period of expected benefit from the expenditure. The related tax charge on the credit is recognized
in the year of the tax credit. This represents a change in accounting policy elected by the Group for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in
accounting policy did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Business Acquisitions
As part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and may acquire in the future, certain businesses and technologies primarily to expand our service
offerings.
2021 Acquisition
On April 1, 2021 the Group acquired all the outstanding equity interests of Meritage Medical Network (“Meritage”), a California professional corporation,
for total consideration of $16,184 thousand in consideration net of cash acquired of $14,043 thousand, of which $13,835 thousand related to cash
consideration and $3,122 thousand related to the fair value of warrants issued to the former shareholders of Meritage. This acquisition is intended to
expand the growth of our value-based care services to patients within the Meritage network.
We accounted for this acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting and have reported the results of operations as of the acquisition date. The
intangible assets acquired include customer relationships, tradenames, physician networks and a license. We based the estimated fair value of customer
relationship intangibles using an income approach, utilizing the excess earnings method for customer relationships. This form of the income approach
utilizes management’s estimates of future operating results and cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects market participant
assumptions. We based the estimate fair value of tradenames and the license using a cost approach that reflects the costs necessary to replace the
service capacity of the acquired assets. We based the estimated fair value of the tradename using an income approach, utilizing the relief from royalty
method. This form of the income approach utilizes management’s estimates of future operating results and cash flows using a royalty rate that reflects
market participant assumptions. Other significant judgements used in the valuation of tangible liabilities assumed in the acquisition included a valuation
of the healthcare related liabilities acquired, which were primarily based on historical claims experience to estimate the liability on the acquisition date. The
Group has recorded the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the acquisitions over the fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill.
The goodwill reflects our expectations of favourable future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies through the use of our digital healthcare platform
and the assembled workforce. We expect that the majority of the goodwill acquired in the acquisition will not be deductible for corporate income tax
purposes.
Acquisition related costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our interim financial statements. Total acquisition-related costs
incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $162 thousand and $0, respectively.

Purchase Price Allocation
We have performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The final
purchase price allocations will be determined when we have completed and fully reviewed the detailed valuations and could differ materially from the
preliminary allocation. The final allocation may include changes of acquired intangible assets as well as goodwill and other changes to assets and
liabilities, including deferred taxes. The estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets are also preliminary.
The aggregate purchase price of the acquisition has been allocated on a preliminary basis as follows:
2021

Total revenues attributable to the acquisition of Meritage were approximately $15,323 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Net losses
attributable to the acquisition of Meritage since the acquisition was $2,019 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021. If the acquisition had
occurred on January 1, 2021, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been $144,116 thousand (higher by $15,345 thousand) and
consolidated losses would have been $75,221 thousand (lower by $568 thousand) for the six months ended June 30, 2021. In determining these amounts,
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred
on January 1, 2021.

Disposals of Subsidiaries
On January 14, 2021 the Group entered a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with TELUS Corporation (“TELUS”), a Canadian publicly traded holding
company which is the parent of various telecommunication subsidiaries, for the sale of the Babylon Health Canada Limited business. The entire issued
share capital of Babylon Health Canada Limited was transferred to TELUS for a base price of $1,800 thousand CAD, which has been adjusted for working
capital and net indebtedness. A further $3,500 thousand payment was made by TELUS that was attributable to a partial repayment of an Intercompany
Loan due from Babylon Canada to Babylon Partners Limited. The remaining amount of the Intercompany loan was forgiven immediately prior to the
execution of the SPA.

In January 2021, we entered into a License and Support Agreement (“License Agreement”) with TELUS. As part of the License Agreement, the Group
received an upfront payment of approximately $66.9 million in exchange for the right to use the Company’s digital healthcare platform (“Software
Platform”), specified upgrades to be delivered over a 24-month period, post-contract support (“PCS”), and a right to access enhancements to the Group’s
Software Platform over a period of seven years. We identified that the License Agreement included multiple performance obligations and allocated the
transaction price to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone basis. We determined the standalone selling prices based on our
overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market inputs and entity specific factors, including standalone selling prices when available. We also
concluded that the upfront payment included a significant financing component. As a result, the transaction price was adjusted to account for the time
value of money and interest expense will be recognized over the duration of the contract.

The contract assets primarily relate to the Group’s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. There was no impact on
contract assets as a result of acquisition of subsidiaries. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. This
usually occurs when the Group issues an invoice to the customer. The Group’s customers generally pay for invoices in the month following the issuance
date.
iii) Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
The following table includes revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially

Goodwill of $13,471 thousand (2020: $17,771 thousand) has been acquired through business combinations (Note 3). All development costs, including
intangibles under development, have been internally generated by the Group. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, $14,903 thousand (2020: $51,932
thousand) of intangibles under development were transferred to development costs as these projects were completed. Intangibles under development are
tested for impairment at least annually.
The total net book value is considered to be the recoverable amount, as this balance is reviewed annually and impaired as necessary. All development
costs are related to software and artificial intelligence development and there are no distinguishable individually material intangible assets within the
capitalised development costs. There was no impairment of the development costs in the six months ended June 30, 2021 (2020: $6,438 thousand).

Health Innovators
Babylon acquired equity interests in Health Innovators Inc. in 2019. In the event of a liquidation, Babylon has a preferential right to recover amounts
invested prior to other shareholders or receive its percentage of net assets of Health Innovators, whichever is greater. Since the acquisition date the net
assets of Health Innovators Inc. have been less than Babylon’s total investment, therefore Babylon consolidates 100.0% of Health Innovators Inc.’s net
assets and no NCI is recognized.
Higi
On May 15, 2020 Babylon Acquisition Corp. acquired 11.0% of the preference shares in Higi SH Holdings Inc. (“Higi”). Higi provides digital healthcare
services via a network of Smart Health Stations located around the USA, the investment is in line with the Group’s objective to provide accessible and
affordable healthcare.
The Group had the option to increase their shareholding in Higi to 25% exercisable over the period to June 2021 and subsequently has the option to
purchase the remaining 75% of shares exercisable over the period to May 2023. At June 30, 2021 the total shareholding was 25.0%.
Higi is accounted for as an associate because the Group is able to demonstrate significant influence over Higi through representation on the board, the
power to participate in policy. During the period to June 30, 2021 the Group did not have the substantive rights to exert control over Higi due to the
existence of significant barriers that prevented exercise of the purchase option.

Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
As of June 30, 2021, our financial statements includes a total carrying amount of $12,600 thousand, total investment of $15,000 thousand and a loss of
$1,276 thousand related to Higi. If the Group did have substantive rights to exert control over Higi, management estimates that consolidated losses would
have been $80,135 thousand (higher by $4,346 thousand) and consolidated net assets would have been $56,710 thousand (lower by $1,090 thousand) for
the six months ended June 30, 2021.

The Group’s short term investment funds are highly liquid, redeemable within 90 days at a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk
of change in value and therefore meet the definition of a cash equivalent.

Leases
The Group leases several assets which consist of buildings and IT equipment. The Group recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for its
building leases only, as the leases for IT equipment meet the exemption requirements as short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
The Group enteried into a new lease agreement for four floors of a building facility as the head office in London. The commencement date of the lease is
in June 2021, with the initial term of the lease being 39 months. The lease provides for an annual rent of $4.9m after a twelve-month rent-free period
following the lease commencement date.

On November 12, 2020 the Group executed a Convertible Loan Note agreement (“CLN” or “Loan Notes”) with a borrowing capacity of up to $200,000
thousand, under which $30,000 thousand Tranche 1 Notes and $70,000 thousand Tranche 2 Notes were issued to Global Health Equity (Cyprus) Ltd
(“GHE” or the “Noteholder” or the “Lender”) in November and December 2020. GHE is part of the VNV Global group. VNV Global has a pre-existing
equity interest in Babylon. The notes had a nominal value of $1.
Tranche 1 Notes
Tranche 1 Notes of $30,000 thousand were issued to GHE on November 12, 2020. Interest accrues at a fixed non-compounding rate of 11% per annum from
the date of issuance to redemption or conversion. These notes were subsequently converted into Series C Preferred Shares, in the prior period, after the
issuance of the Tranche 2 Notes and shareholder approval of the conversion feature.
Tranche 2 Notes
Tranche 2 Notes of $70,000 thousand were issued on December 16, 2020 and are not interest bearing. The Tranche 2 Notes are exchangeable into a
variable number of Series C Preferred Shares upon the earlier of the occurrence of certain events or June 30, 2021.These notes were subsequently
converted into Series C Preferred Shares after shareholder approval of the conversion feature.
As the Tranche 2 Notes fail the definition of equity, the Group considered whether the conversion feature in the Tranche 2 Notes is a non-closely related
embedded derivative which would require separation from the debt host contract and to be accounted for separately as a standalone derivative at fair
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). It has been determined that the Tranche 2 Notes represent a hybrid instrument containing a debt host debt
contract and a non-closely related embedded derivative for the conversion feature.
The debt host contract is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method. The fair value of the embedded derivative and
transaction costs associated with issuance of the instrument are not material.
On June 30, 2021 the $70,000 thousand Tranche 2 notes were converted into 41,012,358 “C” preference shares, refer to note 15 for details.
14.
Employee Benefits
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to employees of the Group and advisors, whereby services are rendered in exchange for rights
over shares in the Group. Employees of all Group companies participate within this scheme.
Options are granted to employees at the start of their employment. Upon completion of the first year of employment, 25.0% of options will vest, and the
remainder will vest monthly over the next three years. In certain
F-24
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
circumstances, additional options are granted to employees to recognize performance. Such options vest in the same manner as those granted on joining.
Share options are accounted for using the graded vesting method.
Options granted to advisors also vest over a 4-year period, subject to the advisors providing consultancy services on an ad hoc basis and at board
meetings.
In February 2021, the Board approved a special equity grant of 10,150,395 growth shares to be awarded to three employees (“Growth Shares”), with a
subscription price of $0.03 per share. The Growth Shares vest one year from the date of the grantee’s date of hire. The Growth Shares allow the grantee to
benefit from the difference between the value of the number of Growth Shares awarded and the benchmark valuation. The Growth Shares convert into the
Company’s ordinary B Shares upon an exit event, which includes a business merger, an initial public offering, or certain other events (“Exit Event”). The
Growth Shares are redeemable at the sole discretion of the Company at $0.00001227 or at some other amount at the discretion of the Board of Directors
prior to an Exit Event upon cessation of employment. The group calculated the grant date fair value of the Growth Shares using a Monte Carlo Simulation
of approximately $9.7 million. The key assumptions used were a pre-money equity value of $3.5 billion and a volatility rate of 54%.
In March 2021, the Company made an offer to all existing UK participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) to convert their LTIP share options
into a new Company Share Options Plan (“CSOP”) or into Restricted Share Awards (“RSAs”). There were no changes made participants’ awards that
accepted the offer, including vesting conditions or period the original share options granted; however, as a result of this activity, all employees who
elected to have their LTIP option converted to a new CSOP award had their existing LTIP options forfeited and were granted an increased number of share
options in line with the increased exercise price under the CSOP and RSU plans. For those participants who accepted the offer convert their awards into
the CSOP Plan, a total of 34,180,103 options were cancelled and replaced with 25,566,186 options and 16,697,963 RSAs during the six months ending June
30, 2021. These RSAs vest over a four-year period, with 25% of the RSA vesting in the first year, and monthly thereafter. As of June 30, 2021, 16,697,963
RSAs were outstanding. As of June 30, 2021, there were 70,410,659 options outstanding, of which 52,000,990 were vested with a weighted average
exercise price of $0.09.
The Group recognized share-based payment expense of $12.3 million and $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
With the exception of the extension to our revenue accounting policy in regard to licensing revenues, the accounting policies applied in these condensed
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is primarily derived from the following sources: (1) software license fees for the provision of AI services, (2) patient revenues from the provision
of clinical services, and (3) capitation revenue from value-based care services.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Group expects to receive
in exchange for those services.
Contract assets are recognized when there is an excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts where the rights are conditional on something other
than passage of time. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (i.e. only invoicing is pending) when there is an unconditional right to receive
cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
Income received in advance (“contract liability”) is recognized when there are billings in excess of revenues earned for services rendered.
The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. The Group assesses the services promised in a
contract and identifies distinct or bundled performance obligations in the contract. Identification of these performance obligations involves judgement to
determine the promises and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such promises. If multiple performance obligations are identified in
the contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Group recognizes
revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. Transaction prices are adjusted for the effects of a significant financing
component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and when the
customer pays for that service will be more than one year.
The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Group
considers indicators such as how a customer consumes benefits as services are rendered, existence of enforceable rights to payment for performance to
date, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer and acceptance of delivery of the service by the customer.
Software licensing revenue
Under IFRS 15, the Group must determine whether the Group’s promise to grant a software license provides its customer with either a right to access the
Group’s intellectual property (“IP”) or a right to use the Group’s IP. A
F-28
Table of Contents
Babylon Holdings Limited
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
software license will provide a right to access the IP if there is significant development of the IP expected in the future, whereas for a right to use, the IP is
to be used in the condition it is at the time the software license is signed. Our license fee revenue consists of AI services that are provided on a
continuous basis for the contractual period. Where we have determined that the customer obtains a right to access our AI services, we recognize revenue
on a straight-line basis over the contractual term beginning when the customer has access to the service. Where we identify that the customer obtains a
right to use license, we recognize revenue at the point in time at which the license is granted. Any contract specific revenue relating to localisation of
services prior to the commencement of software license term is not deemed to be distinct from the software license contract and is consequently also
recognized over the software license term. Efforts to satisfy performance obligations are expended evenly throughout the performance period and so the
performance obligation is considered to be satisfied evenly over time.
For software license arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Group accounts for the individual performance obligations if they
are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations in the software license on a relative standalone basis. We
determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market inputs and entity specific factors,
including standalone selling prices when available.
In some cases, we have concluded that upfront payments included in software license contracts with customers have a significant financing component
considering the period between the upfront payment and the services provided, when the contract term is more than one year. As a result, the transaction
price must be adjusted to account for the time value of money by using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate utilized is determined based on
the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction with the customer. When a significant financing component exists, we recognize a
contract liability for the entire upfront cash payment received, excluding the amount relating to the financing component from the transaction price.
Additionally, interest expense is recognized over the duration of the contract under the amortised interest method
17.

Subsequent events
On July 15, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a loan agreement with VNV Group for $15.0 million. The interest rate on the loan was 14%.
On August 18, 2021, the Group issued $50.0 million in unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (“Unsecured Bonds”), including the non-cash conversion
of $8.0 million in borrowings under the loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The interest rate on the loan
is 10%, with interest payable quarterly. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds can be used for general corporate purposes. The Company utilized
proceeds of $7.2 million from the Unsecured Bonds to settle the remainder of the loan and interest with VNV (Cyprus) Limited. Cash proceeds from the
bond issuance, net of discounts, repayments of borrowings, and transaction expenses totalled approximately $32.1 million. The Unsecured Bonds have a
one-year term and they can be redeemed by Babylon Holdings at any time. Payment of the bonds is mandatory upon completion of a business
combination or change in control. Babylon Holdings must maintain a minimum cash balance of $10.0 million to comply with financial covenants.

Paycheck Protection Program
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread
throughout the United States and rest of the world. This has adversely impacted global economic activity and contributed to significant declines
and volatility in financial markets.
On March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) was enacted.
The CARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package, which among other things contains numerous income tax
provisions applicable to U.S. income tax. Some of these tax provisions are expected to be effective retroactively for years ending before the date of
enactment. The Company is currently evaluating the implications of the Act and its impact on the financial statements.
In response to the pandemic, on April 6, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $1,000,400 under the Paycheck Protection
Program (PPP) which was established as part of the CARES Act and is administered through the Small Business Administration (SBA). The PPP
provides loans to qualifying businesses in amounts up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll expenses and was designed to provide a direct
financial incentive for qualifying businesses to keep their workforce employed during the Coronavirus crisis. PPP loans are uncollateralized and
guaranteed by the SBA and are forgivable after a “covered period” (eight or twenty-four weeks) as long as the borrower maintains its payroll levels
and uses the loan proceeds for eligible expenses, including payroll, benefits, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. The forgiveness amount will be
reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries and wages more than 25 percent during the covered period. Any unforgiven
portion is payable over two years if issued before, or five years if issued after, June 5, 2020 at an interest rate of one percent with payments deferred
until the SBA remits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender, or, if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness, ten months after the
end of the covered period. PPP loan terms provide for customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and
warranties, and insolvency events and may be accelerated upon the occurrence of one or more of these events of default. Additionally, PPP loan
terms do not include prepayment penalties.
The Company met the PPP’s loan forgiveness requirements, and therefore, applied for forgiveness during November of 2020. On April 1, 2021, the
Company received legal release from the SBA, and therefore, presented the amount forgiven, $1,000,400, as forgiveness of paycheck program funds
within the other income section in its 2021 statements of operations.
The SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP loan, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. In accordance
with the CARES Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their PPP loan documentation for six years after the PPP loan was forgiven or repaid in
full and to provide that documentation to the SBA upon request.

Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) but who do not enter into gain recognition agreements within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B) and 1.367(a)-8, qualifies for an exception to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code (collectively, the “Intended Tax Treatment”). Each
Party hereto agrees, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, to report for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with, and not otherwise take
any U.S. federal income tax position inconsistent with, the Intended Tax Treatment, including causing the SPAC (and providing any information
reasonably available to such Party that is necessary to allow the SPAC) to comply with the filing and reporting requirements in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6) in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment (including, without limitation, timely filing its U.S. federal income Tax
Return for its Tax year in which the Merger is consummated (taking into account any extensions of time therefor) and attaching to such timely filed Tax
Return the statement titled “Section 367(a)-Reporting of Cross-Border Transfer Under Reg. §1.367(a)-3(c)(6),” signed under penalties of perjury by an
officer of the SPAC to the best of the officer’s knowledge and belief), in each case, unless otherwise required pursuant to a “determination” within the
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code. No Party shall take or cause to be taken any action, or knowingly fail to take or cause to be taken any action that
prevents the Intended Tax Treatment, in each case, other than any action or failure to act (i) required by a change in applicable Law (including the Code,
Treasury Regulations or other IRS published guidance), (ii) contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except to the extent any such action or failure to
act is attributable to a manifest error in such Transaction Document; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transaction Documents contemplate
that the Surviving Corporation will not be further merged or liquidated following the Merger in connection with the Transactions, or (iii) relating to
reporting for Tax purposes, which are addressed by the preceding sentence . Each of the Parties hereto further acknowledges and hereby agrees that (x) it
is not a condition to the Closing that the Mergers qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) and (y) no Tax opinion that the
Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or otherwise qualifies for the Intended Tax Treatment is being given
by counsel to any of the SPAC, the Company, the Merger Sub or any other Party hereto.
(b) The Company shall cause all Transfer Taxes to be paid. The Company shall prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and filed, in a timely
manner, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, the Parties will, and will
cause their respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate and join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Parties shall
reasonably cooperate to establish any available exemption from (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax. The Company shall provide the other Parties with
evidence reasonably satisfactory to such other Party or Parties that such Transfer Taxes have been paid, or if the relevant transactions are exempt from
Transfer Taxes, evidence of the filing of an appropriate certificate or other evidence of exemption.
(c) Following the Closing, the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company or any designee of such committee (the “Audit
Committee”) shall have the authority to oversee compliance by the Company and the Surviving Corporation with the filing and reporting provisions of
this Section 11.20, and the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall submit such matters to the Audit Committee for its oversight.

(a) Administration. The Plan is administered by the Administrator. The Administrator has authority to (i) determine which Service Providers receive
Awards, (ii) grant Awards, and (iii) set Award terms and conditions, in each case subject to the conditions and limitations in the Plan and all Applicable
Laws. The Administrator also has the authority to take all actions and make all determinations under the Plan, to approve the forms of Award Agreements
for use under the Plan, to interpret the Plan and the terms of Awards and to adopt, amend and repeal Plan administrative rules, guidelines and practices as
it deems advisable. The Administrator may correct defects and ambiguities, supply omissions and reconcile inconsistencies in the Plan or any Award as it
deems necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan and any Awards. The Administrator’s determinations under the Plan are in its sole discretion and
will be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan or any Award.
(b) Appointment of Committees. To the extent Applicable Laws permit, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to one or
more Committees or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Board may abolish any Committee or re-vest in itself any previously delegated

(a) Number of Shares. Subject to adjustment under Section 8 and the terms of this Section 4, Awards may be made under the Plan (taking account
of Awards granted under the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) in an aggregate amount up to 45,335,210 Shares plus any Shares that become available under the
Plan pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) below (the “Share Reserve”). In addition, the Share Reserve will automatically increase on January 1st of each year
commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 45,335,210 Shares; and (ii) 5% of the
total number of all classes of shares of the Company that have been issued as at December 31st of the preceding calendar year, in each case , subject to
applicable law and the Company having sufficient authorised but unissued shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may act prior to January 1st
of a given year to provide that there will be no January 1st increase in the Share Reserve for such year or that the increase in the Share Reserve for such
year will be a lesser (but not a greater) number of Shares than would otherwise occur pursuant to the preceding sentence.
(b) Limit Applies to Shares Issued Pursuant to Awards. For clarity, the Share Reserve is a limit on the number of Shares that may be issued
pursuant to Awards that were granted under this Plan and does not limit the granting of Awards, except that the Company will keep available at all times
the number of Shares reasonably required to satisfy its obligations to issue shares pursuant to such Awards. Shares may be issued in connection with a
merger or acquisition as permitted by, as applicable, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c), the NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 303A.08, the NYSE
American Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule, and such issuance will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the
Plan, as further described under Section 4(e).

exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased or cancelled without having been fully exercised, or is withheld to satisfy a tax withholding obligation in
connection with an Award or to satisfy a purchase or exercise price of an Award, the unused Shares covered by the Award or Awards granted under the
Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) will, as applicable, become or again be available for Awards granted under the Plan (including the Non-
Employee Sub-Plan).
(ii) If all or any part of an option or options to acquire unissued Shares that was granted under the Prior Plans and which is subsisting as of
the Effective Date expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased or cancelled without having been fully exercised, or is
withheld to satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with an option or to satisfy a purchase or exercise price of an option, in each case on or
after the Effective Date, the unused Shares covered by such option or options under the Prior Plans shall increase the Share Reserve and shall become
available for Awards granted under the Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) subject to a maximum of 23,902,282 Shares.
(d) ISO Limitations. Subject to adjustment under Section 8 and to the overall Share Reserve, no more than 69,237,492 Shares may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of ISOs.
(e) Substitute Awards. In connection with an entity’s merger or consolidation with the Company or the Company’s acquisition of an entity’s
property or stock, the Administrator may grant Awards in substitution for any options or other equity or equity-based awards granted before such
merger or consolidation by such entity or its affiliate. Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms as the Administrator deems appropriate,
notwithstanding limitations on Awards in the Plan. Subject to Applicable Laws, Substitute Awards will not count against the Share Reserve (nor shall
Shares subject to a Substitute Award be added to the Shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided above), except that Shares acquired by
exercise of substitute ISOs will count against the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs under the Plan.
Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has
shares available under a pre-existing plan not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, then, subject to Applicable Laws, shares
available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or
valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of ordinary shares or common
stock (as applicable) of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares
authorized for grant under the Plan (and Shares subject to such Awards shall not be added to the Shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided
above); provided that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the
pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not Employees or Directors prior to such
acquisition or combination.
(f) Date of Grant. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the date of grant of an Award shall be the date of the Administrator’s
approval of that Award.
(g) Deed Poll. The Administrator may grant Awards by entering into a deed poll and, as soon as practicable after the Company has executed the
deed poll, the Administrator shall enter into an Award Agreement.

(a) General. The Administrator may grant Options or Share Appreciation Rights to Service Providers subject to the limitations in the Plan,
including any limitations in the Plan that apply to ISOs. The Administrator will determine the number of Shares covered by each Option and Share
Appreciation Right, the exercise price of each Option and Share Appreciation Right and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of each
Option and Share Appreciation Right. Each Option will be designated in writing as an ISO or Non-Qualified Option at the time of grant; provided,
however, that if an Option is not so designated, then such Option will be a Non-Qualified Option, and the Shares purchased upon exercise of each type of
Option will be separately accounted for. A Share Appreciation Right will entitle the Participant (or other person entitled to exercise the Share Appreciation
Right) to receive from the Company upon exercise of the exercisable portion of the Share Appreciation Right an amount determined by multiplying the
excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price per Share of the Share Appreciation Right by the
number of Shares with respect to which the Share Appreciation Right is exercised, subject to any limitations of the Plan or that the Administrator may
impose and payable in cash, Shares valued at Fair Market Value or a combination of the two as the Administrator may determine or provide in the Award
Agreement. A Participant will have no rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to any Option or Share Appreciation Right unless and until
any Shares are issued in settlement of the Option or Share Appreciation Right.
(b) Exercise Price. The Administrator will establish each Option’s and Share Appreciation Right’s exercise price and specify the exercise price in
the Award Agreement. Subject to Section 10(g), the exercise price will be no less than the nominal value of a Share and, in respect of Participants who are
subject to tax in the United States, shall also not be less than less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the grant date of the Option or Share
Appreciation Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or Share Appreciation Right may be granted with an exercise price lower than 100% of the
Fair Market Value on the date of grant of such Award if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another option or share
appreciation right pursuant to Section 4(e) and, in respect of Participants who are subject to tax in the United States, in a manner consistent with the
provisions of Sections 409A and, if applicable, 424(a) of the Code.
(c) Duration. Each Option or Share Appreciation Right will vest and be exercisable at such times and as specified in the Award Agreement,
provided that the term of an Option or Share Appreciation Right will not exceed ten years, subject to Section 10(g). Notwithstanding the foregoing and
unless determined otherwise by the Company, in the event that on the last business day of the term of an Option or Share Appreciation Right (other than
an ISO) (i) the exercise of the Option or Share Appreciation Right is prohibited by Applicable Laws, as determined by the Company, or (ii) Shares may not
be purchased or sold by the applicable Participant due to any Company insider trading, window period and/or dealing policy (including blackout
periods), the term of the Option or Share Appreciation Right shall be extended until the date that is thirty (30) days after the end of the legal prohibition,
black-out period, as determined by the Company; provided, however, in no event shall the extension last beyond the original term of the applicable
Option or Share Appreciation Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant, prior to the end of the term of an Option or Share Appreciation
Right, violates the non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality or other similar restrictive covenant provisions of any employment contract,
confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the right of the
Participant and the Participant’s transferees to exercise any Option or Share Appreciation Right issued to the Participant shall terminate immediately upon
such violation, unless the Company otherwise determines. In addition, if, prior to the end of the term of an Option or Share Appreciation Right, the
Participant is given notice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for Cause, and the effective date of such Termination of Service is subsequent to the date of the delivery of such notice, the right of the Participant and
the Participant’s transferees to exercise any Option or Share Appreciation Right issued to the Participant shall be suspended from the time of the delivery
of such notice until the earlier of (i) such time as it is determined or otherwise agreed that the Participant’s service as a Service Provider will not be
terminated for Cause as provided in such notice or (ii) the effective date of the Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company or
C-5Table of Contents
any of its Subsidiaries for Cause (in which case the right of the Participant and the Participant’s transferees to exercise any Option or Share Appreciation
Right issued to the Participant will terminate immediately upon the effective date of such Termination of Service); provided, however, in no event shall the
suspension cause the original term of the applicable Option or Share Appreciation Right to be extended.
(d) Exercise. Options and Share Appreciation Rights may be exercised by delivering to the Company a written notice of exercise, in a form the
Administrator approves (which may be electronic), signed by the person authorized to exercise the Option or Share Appreciation Right, together with, as
applicable, payment in full (i) as specified in Section 5(e) for the number of Shares for which the Award is exercised and (ii) as specified in Section 9(e) for
any applicable taxes. Unless the Administrator otherwise determines, an Option or Share Appreciation Right may not be exercised for a fraction of a
Share.
(e) Payment Upon Exercise. Subject to any Company insider trading, window period and/or dealing policy (including blackout periods) and
Applicable Laws, the exercise price of an Option must be paid by:
(i) cash, wire transfer of immediately available funds or by check payable to the order of the Company, provided that the Company may limit
the use of one of the foregoing payment forms if one or more of the payment forms below is permitted;
(ii) if there is a public market for Shares at the time of exercise, unless the Administrator otherwise determines, (A) delivery (including
telephonically to the extent permitted by the Company) of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver
promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price, or (B) the Participant’s delivery to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and
unconditional instructions to a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to pay the exercise price;
provided that such amount is paid to the Company at such time as may be required by the Administrator;
(iii) to the extent permitted by the Administrator at the time of exercise, transfer of Shares owned by the Participant free and clear of any
liens, claims, encumbrances or security interests, which, when valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date, have a value sufficient to pay the
exercise price, provided that (1) at the time of exercise the Shares are publicly traded, (2) any remaining balance of the exercise price not satisfied by such
transfer is paid by the Participant in cash or other permitted form of payment, (3) such transfer would not violate any Applicable Laws or agreement
restricting the redemption of the Shares, (4) if required by the Administrator, any certificated Shares are endorsed or accompanied by an executed
assignment separate from certificate, and (5) such Shares have been held by the Participant for any minimum period necessary to avoid adverse
accounting treatment as a result of such delivery;
(iv) to the extent permitted by the Administrator at the time of exercise, except with respect to ISOs, surrendering the largest whole number
of Shares then issuable upon the Option’s exercise which, when valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date, have a value sufficient to pay the
exercise price, provided that (1) such Shares used to pay the exercise price will not be exercisable thereafter and (2) any remaining balance of the exercise
price not satisfied by such net exercise is paid by the Participant in cash or other permitted form of payment;
(v) to the extent permitted by the Administrator at the time of exercise and permitted by Applicable Law, delivery of any other property that
the Administrator determines is good and valuable consideration; or
(vi) to the extent permitted by the Company, any combination of the above payment forms approved by the Administrator.
(f) Non-Exempt U.S. Employees. No Option or Share Appreciation Right, whether or not vested, granted to an Employee who is a non-exempt
employee for purposes of the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as
C-6
Table of Contents
amended, will be first exercisable for any Shares until at least six months following the date of grant of such Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
accordance with the provisions of the U.S. Worker Economic Opportunity Act, any vested portion of such Award may be exercised earlier than six
months following the date of grant of such Award in the event of (i) such Participant’s death or Disability, (ii) a Corporate Event in which such Award is
not assumed, continued or substituted, (iii) a Change in Control, or (iv) such Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the Award
Agreement or another applicable agreement or, in the absence of any such definition, in accordance with the Company’s then current employment
policies and guidelines). This Section 5(f) is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or
vesting of an Option or Share Appreciation Right will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay.

(a) General. The Administrator may issue Restricted Shares, or grant rights to purchase Restricted Shares, to any Service Provider, subject to the
Company’s right to convert such Restricted Shares to deferred shares and redeem them under the terms of the Company’s articles of association, or to
require such shares to be transferred to an employee benefit trust, or to repurchase all or part of such shares at their issue price or other stated or formula
price from the Participant (or to require forfeiture or compulsory transfer of such shares in such manner as the Administrator may determine) if conditions
the Administrator specifies in the Award Agreement are not satisfied before the end of the applicable restriction period or periods that the Administrator
establishes for such Award. In addition, the Administrator may grant to Service Providers Restricted Share Units, which may be subject to vesting,
issuance and forfeiture conditions during the applicable restriction period or periods, as set forth in an Award Agreement. The Administrator will
determine and set forth in the Award Agreement the terms and conditions for each Restricted Share and Restricted Share Unit Award, subject to the
conditions and limitations contained in the Plan.
(b) Duration. Each Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit will vest at such times and as specified in the Award Agreement, provided that the
vesting schedule of a Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit will not exceed ten years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant, prior to the
vesting date of a Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit, violates the non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality or other similar restrictive
covenant provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the right of the Participant and the Participant’s transferees to receive Shares on the vesting of the Restricted Share
or Restricted Share Unit issued to the Participant shall terminate immediately upon such violation, unless the Company otherwise determines. In addition,
if, prior to the vesting date of a Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit, the Participant is given notice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the
Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause, and the effective date of such Termination of Service is
subsequent to the date of the delivery of such notice, the right of the Participant and the Participant’s transferees to receive Shares as a result of the
vesting of the Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit issued to the Participant shall be suspended from the time of the delivery of such notice until the
earlier of (i) such time as it is determined or otherwise agreed that the Participant’s service as a Service Provider will not be terminated for Cause as
provided in such notice or (ii) the effective date of the Participant’s Termination of Service by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause (in which
case the right of the Participant and the Participant’s transferees to receive Shares on the vesting of the Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit issued
to the Participant will terminate immediately upon the effective date of such Termination of Service).
(c) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any Restricted
Shares or Shares subject to Restricted Share Units, as determined (and on such terms as may be determined) by the Administrator and specified in the
Award Agreement, subject to Applicable Laws.
C-7Table of Contents
(d) Restricted Shares.
(i) Form of Award. The Company may require that the Participant deposit in escrow with the Company (or its designee) any certificates
issued in respect of Restricted Shares, together with a stock transfer form endorsed in blank. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, a
Participant will have voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Restricted Shares, save that any redesignation and
subsequent redemption and forfeiture provisions of the Company’s articles of association shall apply.
(ii) Consideration. Restricted Shares may be granted in consideration for (A) cash or check, bank draft or money order payable to the
Company, (B) past services to the Company or a Subsidiary, or (C) any other form of consideration (including future services) as the Administrator may
determine to be acceptable and which is permissible under Applicable Laws.
(e) Restricted Share Units.
(i) Settlement. The Administrator may provide that settlement of Restricted Share Units will occur upon or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Restricted Share Units vest or will instead be deferred, on a mandatory basis or at the Participant’s election.
(ii) Shareholder Rights. A Participant will have no rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to any Restricted Share Unit
unless and until the Shares are delivered in settlement of the Restricted Share Unit.
(iii) Consideration. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at the time of grant, Restricted Share Units will be granted in
consideration for the Participant’s services to the Company or a Subsidiary, such that the Participant will not be required to make any payment to the
Company (other than such services) with respect to the grant or vesting of the Award, or the issuance of any Shares pursuant to the Award. If, at the time
of grant, the Administrator determines that any consideration must be paid by the Participant (in a form other than the Participant’s services to the
Company or a Subsidiary) upon the issuance of any Shares in settlement of the Award, such consideration may be paid in any form of consideration as
the Administrator may determine to be acceptable and which is permissible under Applicable Laws.

Such Other Share Based Awards will also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other Awards, as standalone payments and as payment in

(a) Equity Restructuring. In connection with any Equity Restructuring, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, the
Administrator will equitably adjust (i) class(es) and maximum number of Shares subject to the Plan, (ii) the class(es) and maximum number of Shares that
may be issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs under Section 4(d) above and (iii) each outstanding Award as it deems appropriate to reflect the Equity
Restructuring, which may include adjusting the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and/or the Award’s exercise price or
grant price (if applicable), granting new Awards to Participants, and making a cash payment to Participants. The adjustments provided under this Section
8(a) will be nondiscretionary and final and binding on the affected Participant and the Company; provided that the Administrator will determine whether
an adjustment is equitable.

(b) Corporate Events. In the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, amalgamation, repurchase, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, or sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale or exchange of
Shares or other securities of the Company or a Change in Control (any “Corporate Event”), the Administrator, on such terms and conditions as it deems
appropriate, is hereby authorized to take any one or more of the following actions whenever the Administrator determines that such action is appropriate:
(i) To provide for the cancellation of any such Award in exchange for either an amount of cash or other property with a value equal to the
amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise or settlement of the vested portion of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights under
the vested portion of such Award, as applicable; provided that, if the amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise or settlement of the vested
portion of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights, in any case, is equal to or less than zero (as determined by the Administrator in its
discretion), then the Award may be terminated without payment. In addition, such payments under this provision may, in the Administrator’s discretion,
be delayed to the same extent that payment of consideration to the holders of Shares in connection with the Corporate Event is delayed as a result of
escrows, earn outs, holdbacks or any other contingencies;
(ii) To provide that such Award shall vest and, to the extent applicable, be exercisable as to all Shares covered thereby, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Plan or the provisions of such Award as of a date prior to the effective time of such Corporate Event as the Administrator
determines (or, if the Administrator does not determine such a date, as of the date that is five (5) days prior to the effective date of the Corporate Event),
with such Award terminating if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Corporate Event; provided, however, that the
Administrator may require Participants to complete and deliver to the Company a notice of exercise before the effective date of a Corporate Event, which
exercise is contingent upon the effectiveness of such Corporate Event;
(iii) To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or surviving entity, or a parent or Subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted
for by awards covering the equity securities of the successor or surviving entity, or a parent or Subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the
number and kind of shares and/or applicable exercise or purchase price, in all cases, as determined by the Administrator;
(iv) To arrange for the assignment of any forfeiture, reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Shares issued
pursuant to the Award to the surviving entity or acquiring entity (or the surviving or acquiring corporation’s parent entity);
(v) To arrange for the lapse, in whole or in part, of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to the Award;
(vi) To replace such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator;
(vii) To provide that the Award will terminate, with or without consideration, and cannot vest, be exercised or become payable after the
applicable transaction or event; and/or
(viii) To provide that any Shares subject to an Award shall be converted to deferred shares and redeemed under the terms of the Company’s
articles of association, or to require such Shares to be transferred to an employee benefit trust.
The Administrator need not take the same action or actions with respect to all Awards or portions thereof or with respect to all Participants. The
Administrator may take different actions with respect to the vested and unvested portions of an Award.
(c) Administrative Stand Still. In the event of any pending Corporate Event or other similar transaction, for administrative convenience, the
Administrator may refuse to permit the exercise of any Award for up to thirty days before or after such Corporate Event or other similar transaction.

(d) General. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or the Administrator’s action under the Plan, no Participant will have any rights due to any
subdivision or consolidation of Shares of any class, distribution, dividend payment, increase or decrease in the number of Shares of any class, issue,
rights issue, offer or dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation of the Company or other corporation. Except as expressly provided with respect to
an Equity Restructuring under Section 8(a) above or the Administrator’s action under the Plan, no issuance by the Company of Shares of any class, or
securities convertible into Shares of any class, will affect, and no adjustment will be made regarding, the number of Shares subject to an Award or the
Award’s grant or exercise price. The existence of the Plan, any Award Agreements and the Awards granted hereunder will not affect or restrict in any way
the Company’s right or power to make or authorize (i) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s capital structure
or its business, (ii) any Corporate Event or (iii) sale or issuance of securities, including securities with rights superior to those of the Shares or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Shares. The Administrator may treat Participants and Awards (or portions thereof) differently under this Section 8.

GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS",670,672
ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS,"GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS
(a) Transferability. Except as the Administrator may determine or provide in an Award Agreement or otherwise for Awards, Awards may not be
sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and, during the life of the Participant, will be exercisable only by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may, in its
sole discretion, permit transfer of an Award pursuant to a domestic relations order or in such other manner that is not prohibited by applicable tax and
securities laws upon the Participant’s request and provided that the Participant and the transferee enter into a transfer agreement and other agreements as
required by the Company. If an Option is an ISO, such Option may be deemed to be a Non-Qualified Option as a result of a transfer pursuant to this
Section. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in this context, will include references to a Participant’s authorized transferee that the
Administrator specifically approves.
(b) Documentation. Each Award will be evidenced in an Award Agreement, which may be written or electronic, as the Administrator determines. By
accepting any Award the Participant consents to receive documents by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through any on-line electronic
system established and maintained by the Company or another third party selected by the Company. Each Award may contain terms and conditions in
addition to (or a variation of or effecting a disapplication of) those set forth in the Plan. Any reference herein or in an Award Agreement to a “written”
agreement or document will include any agreement or document delivered electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto)
or posted on the Company’s intranet (or other shared electronic medium controlled by the Company to which the Participant has access). As a condition
to accepting an Award under the Plan, the Participant agrees to execute any additional documents or instruments necessary or desirable, as determined in
the Administrator’s sole discretion, to carry out the purposes or intent of the Award, or facilitate compliance with securities and/or other regulatory
requirements, in each case at the Administrator’s request.
(c) Discretion. Except as the Plan otherwise provides, each Award may be made alone or in addition or in relation to any other Award. The terms of
each Award to a Participant need not be identical, and the Administrator need not treat Participants or Awards (or portions thereof) uniformly.
(d) Termination of Status. The Administrator will determine how the disability, death, retirement, authorized leave of absence or any other change
or purported change in a Participant’s Service Provider status (including a change which would result in a Termination of Service under the Plan but not
under the Non-Employee Sub-Plan or vice versa) affects an Award and the extent to which, and the period during which, the Participant, the Participant’s
legal representative, conservator, guardian or Designated Beneficiary may exercise rights under the Award, if applicable.
(e) Withholding. Each Participant must pay the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Administrator for payment of, any taxes (which
includes any social security contributions or the like including
C-10Table of Contents
but not limited to, if applicable, all liability to primary (employee) and secondary (employer) national insurance contributions) required by law to be
withheld or paid by the Company or by any Subsidiary that is the employing entity of the Participant or which Participant has agreed to pay in
connection with such Participant’s Awards by the date of the event creating the tax liability. A Participant may not be able to exercise an Award even
though the Award is vested, and the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares subject to an Award, unless and until such obligations are
satisfied. The Company may deduct an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations based on the maximum statutory withholding rates (or such other
rate as may be determined by the Company after considering any accounting consequences or costs and Applicable Law) from any payment of any kind
otherwise due to a Participant. To the extent permitted by the terms of an Award Agreement and subject to any Company insider trading, window period
and/or dealing policy (including blackout periods), Participants may satisfy such tax obligations (i) in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, by check made payable to the order of the Company, provided that the Company may limit the use of the foregoing payment forms if one or more
of the payment forms below is permitted, (ii) to the extent permitted by the Administrator, in whole or in part by delivery of Shares, including Shares
retained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value, (iii) if there is a public market for Shares at the time the tax
obligations are satisfied, unless the Administrator otherwise determines, (A) delivery (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the Company)
of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to satisfy
the tax obligations, or (B) delivery by the Participant to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a broker acceptable to the
Company to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to satisfy the tax and/or social security withholding, provided that such amount
is paid to the Company at such time as may be required by the Administrator, (iv) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash, (v) withholding
payment from any amounts otherwise payable to the Participant or (vi) to the extent permitted by the Company, any combination of the foregoing
payment forms approved by the Administrator.
(f) Withholding Indemnification. As a condition to accepting an Award under the Plan, in the event that the amount of the Company’s and/or any
Subsidiary’s withholding obligation in connection with such Award was greater than the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries, each Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and/or its Subsidiaries harmless from any failure by the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries to withhold the proper amount.
(g) Amendment of Award; Repricing. The Administrator may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including by cancelling and
substituting another Award of the same or a different type, reducing the exercise price, changing the exercise or settlement date, converting an ISO to a
Non-Qualified Option, taking any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles or by amending, waiving or
relaxing any applicable performance criteria or goal(s). The Participant’s consent to such action will be required unless (i) the action, taking into account
any related action, does not Materially Impair the Participant’s rights under the Award, or (ii) the change is permitted under Section 8 or pursuant to
Section 10(f).
(h) Conditions on Issuance of Shares. The Company will not be obligated to issue any Shares under the Plan or remove restrictions from Shares
previously issued under the Plan until (i) all Award conditions have been met or removed to the Company’s satisfaction, (ii) as determined by the
Company, all other legal matters regarding the issuance of such Shares (including payment of nominal value) have been satisfied, including any
applicable securities laws and stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company
such representations or agreements as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to satisfy any Applicable Laws. The Company’s inability to
obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which the Administrator determines is necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any
securities, will relieve the Company of any liability for failing to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained.
(i) Acceleration. The Administrator may at any time provide that any Award will become immediately vested and fully or partially exercisable, free
of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise fully or partially realizable.

(a) No Right to Employment or Other Status. No person will have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award will not be
construed as giving a Participant the right to continued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the
right at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with a Participant free from any liability or claim under the Plan or any Award, except as
expressly provided in an Award Agreement. Further, nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or in
connection with any Award will constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or a Subsidiary regarding the fact or nature of future positions,
future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or service or confer any right or benefit under the Award or
the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of the Award Agreement and/or Plan.
(b) No Rights as Shareholder; Certificates. Subject to the Award Agreement, no Participant or Designated Beneficiary will have any rights as a
shareholder with respect to any Shares to be distributed under an Award until becoming the record holder of such Shares on the register of members of
the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless the Administrator otherwise determines or Applicable Laws require, the Company
will not be required to deliver to any Participant certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection with any Award and instead such Shares may be
recorded in the register of members of the Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan administrator). The Company may place legends on
certificates issued under the Plan that the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to comply with Applicable Laws.
(c) Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan will come into existence on the day it is adopted by the Board but no Awards may be granted under
the Plan prior to the Effective Date. Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan will remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date,
but Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date in accordance with the Plan. No ISOs may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the
earlier of (i) the date the Plan is adopted by the Board, or (ii) the date the Plan is approved by the Company’s shareholders. If the Plan is not approved by
the Company’s shareholders within 12 months of the date of Board approval of the Plan, all ISOs will be treated as Non-Qualified Options.
(d) Amendment and Termination of Plan. The Administrator may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time; provided that no amendment,
suspension or termination may Materially Impair any Award outstanding at the time of such amendment without the affected Participant’s written
consent. No Awards may be granted under the Plan during any suspension period or after Plan termination. Awards outstanding at the time of any Plan
suspension or termination will continue to be governed by the Plan and the Award Agreement, as in effect before such suspension or termination. The
Board will obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Laws.
(e) Provisions for Foreign Participants. The Administrator may modify Awards granted to Participants who are nationals of, or employed in, a
jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom and the United States or establish subplans or procedures under the Plan to address differences in laws, rules,
regulations or customs of such international jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters, including as may be
necessary or appropriate in the Administrator’s discretion to grant Awards under any tax-favourable regime that may be available in any jurisdiction
(provided that Administrator approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to the Plan or any Award Agreement to ensure or facilitate
compliance with the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction).
(f) Section 409A. The following provisions only apply to Participants subject to tax in the United States:
(i) General. The Company intends that all Awards be structured to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A, such that no adverse tax
consequences, interest, or penalties under Section 409A apply.
C-12Table of Contents
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator may, without a Participant’s consent, amend this Plan
or Awards, adopt policies and procedures, or take any other actions (including amendments, policies, procedures and retroactive actions) as are
necessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of Awards, including any such actions intended to (A) exempt this Plan or any Award
from Section 409A, or (B) comply with Section 409A, including regulations, guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority that may be
issued after an Award’s grant date. The Company makes no representations or warranties as to an Award’s tax treatment under Section 409A or otherwise.
The Company will have no obligation under this Section 10(f) or otherwise to avoid the taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A with respect to any
Award and will have no liability to any Participant or any other person if any Award, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to
constitute noncompliant “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A.
(ii) Separation from Service. If an Award constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A, any payment or
settlement of such Award upon a termination of a Participant’s Service Provider relationship will, to the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section
409A, be made only upon the Participant’s “separation from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A), whether such “separation from service”
occurs upon or after the termination of the Participant’s Service Provider relationship. For purposes of this Plan or any Award Agreement relating to any
such payments or benefits, references to a “termination,” “termination of service”, “termination of employment” or like terms means a “separation from
service.”
(iii) Payments to Specified Employees. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan or any Award Agreement, any payment(s) of
“nonqualified deferred compensation” required to be made under an Award to a “specified employee” (as defined under Section 409A and as the
Administrator determines) due to his or her “separation from service” will, to the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the
Code, be delayed for the six-month period immediately following such “separation from service” (or, if earlier, until the specified employee’s death) and
will instead be paid (as set forth in the Award Agreement) on the day immediately following such six-month period or as soon as administratively
practicable thereafter (without interest). Any payments of “nonqualified deferred compensation” under such Award payable more than six months
following the Participant’s “separation from service” will be paid at the time or times the payments are otherwise scheduled to be made.
(g) 10% Shareholders. The Administrator may grant ISOs only to employees of the Company, any of its present or future parent or subsidiary
corporations, as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code, respectively, and any other entities the employees of which are eligible to receive ISOs
under the Code. If an ISO is granted to a Greater Than 10% Shareholder, the exercise price will not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value on the
Option’s grant date, and the term of the Option will not exceed five years. All ISOs will be subject to and construed consistently with Section 422 of the
Code. By accepting an ISO, the Participant agrees to give prompt notice to the Company of dispositions or other transfers (other than in connection with
a Change in Control) of Shares acquired under the Option made within (i) two years from the grant date of the Option or (ii) one year after the transfer of
such Shares to the Participant, specifying the date of the disposition or other transfer and the amount the Participant realized, in cash, other property,
assumption of indebtedness or other consideration, in such disposition or other transfer. Neither the Company nor the Administrator will be liable to a
Participant, or any other party, if an ISO fails or ceases to qualify as an “incentive stock option” under Section 422 of the Code. Any ISO or portion

receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, to implement, administer and manage the Participant’s participation in the
Plan, including any required Data transfer to a broker or other third party with whom the Company or the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares. The

such Award Agreement, and the Plan and such Award Agreement will be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provisions had been excluded,
and the illegal or invalid action will be null and void.
(l) Governing Documents. If any contradiction occurs between the Plan and any Award Agreement or other written agreement between a
Participant and the Company (or any Subsidiary) that the Administrator has approved, the Plan will govern, unless it is expressly specified in such Award
Agreement or other written document that a specific provision of the Plan will not apply.
All Awards will be subject to Applicable Laws on insider trading and dealing and any specific insider trading, window period and/or dealing policy
adopted by the Company.
(m) Governing Law and Jurisdiction. The Plan and all Awards, including any non-contractual obligations arising in connection therewith, will be
governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, disregarding any jurisdiction’s choice-of-law principles requiring the
application of a jurisdiction’s laws other than that of England and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear
any dispute.
(n) Claw-back Provisions. All Awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit the Participant actually or constructively receives
upon receipt or exercise of any Award or the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award) will be subject to any Company claw-back policy that
may be adopted from time to time to the extent such policy applies to the relevant Participant, including any claw-back policy adopted to comply with
Applicable Laws (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder) as
set forth in such claw-back policy or the Award Agreement, to the extent applicable and permissible under Applicable Laws. No recovery of
compensation under such a claw-back policy will be an event giving rise to a Participant’s right to voluntary terminate employment upon a “resignation
for good reason,” or for a “constructive termination” or any similar term under any plan of or agreement with the Company.
(o) Other Group Company policies. All Awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit the Participant actually or constructively
receives upon receipt or exercise of any Award or the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award) will be subject to any relevant Company or
Group Company policy to the extent such policy applies to the relevant Participant, including but not limited to any remuneration policy and/or share
retention, ownership, or holding policy that may be adopted from time to time.
(p) Titles and Headings. The titles and headings in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, if any conflict, the Plan’s text, rather than
such titles or headings, will control.
(q) Conformity to Applicable Laws. Participant acknowledges that the Plan is intended to conform to the extent necessary with Applicable Laws.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan and all Awards will be administered only in conformance with Applicable Laws. To the extent
Applicable Laws permit, the Plan and all Award Agreements will be deemed amended as necessary to conform to Applicable Laws and may be unilaterally
cancelled by the Company (with the effect that all Participant’s rights thereunder lapse with immediate effect) if the Administrator determines in its
reasonable discretion that such conformity is not possible or practicable.
(r) Relationship to Other Benefits. No payment under the Plan will be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension,
retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except as expressly provided in
writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.

C-15
Table of Contents
the broker-assisted sale will be sold (subject in all cases to the Administrator having regard to the orderly marketing and disposal of such Shares, and
having the discretion to delay broker-assisted sales for such reasons) on the day the payment first becomes due, or as soon thereafter as practicable; (b)
such Shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan in which all Participants receive an average price; (c) the applicable
Participant will be responsible for all broker’s fees and other costs of sale, and by accepting an Award, each Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the
Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale; (d) to the extent the Company or its designee receives
proceeds of such sale that exceed the amount owed, the Company will pay such excess in cash to the applicable Participant as soon as reasonably
practicable; (e) the Company and its designees are under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price; and (f) in the event the proceeds of
such sale are insufficient to satisfy the Participant’s applicable obligation, the Participant may be required to pay immediately upon demand to the
Company or its designee, or the Company or any Subsidiary may withhold from any payment to be made to the Participant (including but not limited to
that Participant’s salary), an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy any remaining portion of the Participant’s obligation.
(t) Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commitment in the performance of his or her services for the
Company and any Subsidiary is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the Employee has a
change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee or takes an extended leave of absence) after the date of grant of any Award to the
Participant, the Administrator may determine, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number of shares
or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time commitment, and
(ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, subject to compliance with Applicable Laws, including, without limitation, Section 409A, extend the
vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the event of any such reduction, the Participant will have no right with respect to any portion
of the Award that is so reduced or extended.
(u) Deferrals. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine that the issuance of Shares or
the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may be deferred and may also establish programs and
procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants.",674,678

Shares under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Shares upon exercise or vesting of such Awards unless
and until such authority is obtained. A Participant is not eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent issuance of Shares pursuant to the Award if
