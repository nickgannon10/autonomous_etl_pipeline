this enhances accessibility to the Ranger special meeting for all of its shareholders and reduces the
carbon footprint of its activities. Ranger has worked to offer the same rights and opportunities to
participate as would be provided at an in-person meeting, while providing an online experience available
to all shareholders regardless of their location.
Instructions on how to attend and participate in the Ranger special meeting virtually are posted at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ROCC2023SM. You should ensure that you have a strong Internet
connection and allow plenty of time to log-in and ensure that you can hear streaming audio prior to the

only meeting platform at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ROCC2023SM.
Who is entitled to vote at the Ranger special meeting?
The record date for the Ranger special meeting is May 17, 2023 (the “Ranger Record Date”). Only
holders of record of shares of Ranger common stock at the close of business on the Ranger Record Date
will be entitled to vote at the Ranger special meeting. Holders of Ranger common stock will vote
together as a single class at the Ranger special meeting. Holders of Ranger common stock are entitled to
one vote per share of Ranger common stock on all matters to be presented at the Ranger special
meeting. Therefore, up to 41,558,952 votes may be cast at the Ranger special meeting. All shares
represented by properly executed and delivered proxies will be voted at the Ranger special meeting.
Please see “Ranger Special Meeting - Voting at the Ranger Special Meeting” for instructions on how
to vote your shares without attending the Ranger special meeting.
How important is my vote as a Ranger shareholder?
Your vote at the Ranger special meeting is very important, and you are encouraged to submit a proxy as
soon as possible. The company merger cannot be completed without the approval of the Ranger Merger
Proposal by the Ranger shareholders. The Class B Holders, which collectively hold approximately 54%
of the outstanding voting power of the Ranger common stock are parties to the Support Agreement with
Baytex pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, except in limited circumstances, to (i) vote in
favor of the company merger, (ii) not transfer their Ranger Class B common stock and common units in
ROCC Energy Holdings, L.P. (“Opco common units”) between signing the Merger Agreement and the
closing of the Merger Transactions and (iii) exercise their right to exchange (the “Opco Unit Exchange”)
all of their Opco common units and shares of Ranger Class B common stock, for shares of Ranger Class
A common stock. For more information, please see “The Merger - The Support Agreement”.
What constitutes a quorum, and what vote is required to approve each proposal at the Ranger special meeting?
A quorum of Ranger’s shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person or by
proxy, of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Ranger special
meeting constitutes a quorum. Abstentions will be counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum.
Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Ranger special
meeting, unless the broker, bank or other nominee has been instructed to vote on at least one of the
proposals.
If a quorum is not present at the Ranger special meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled
to vote who are present or represented by proxy have the power to adjourn the Ranger special meeting
from time to time without notice, other than an announcement at the Ranger special meeting of the time
and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum is present. In addition, under the Ranger Bylaws, the
chairman of Ranger’s board has the power to adjourn the Ranger special meeting for any reason from
time to time without notice, other than an announcement of the time and place of the adjourned meeting,
provided that a new record date is not set. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present,
any business may be transacted that may have been transacted at the Ranger special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Approval of the Ranger Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on
the Ranger Merger Proposal. Abstentions, broker non-votes and failures to vote will not count as votes
cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the Ranger Merger Proposal. The Class B
Holders collectively own more than a majority of the outstanding shares of Ranger common stock
entitled to vote on the Ranger Merger Proposal and, pursuant to the Support Agreement, are obligated,
except in limited circumstances, to vote these shares in favor of the Ranger Merger Proposal, which
would ensure its approval.
Approval of each of the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal and the Ranger Adjournment
Proposal requires that the votes cast “FOR” the proposal exceed the votes cast “AGAINST” the
proposal. Abstentions, broker non-votes and failures to vote will not count as votes cast and, therefore,
will have no effect on the outcome of the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal or the Ranger
Adjournment Proposal.
What will Ranger shareholders receive for their Ranger Class A common stock or Ranger Class B common
stock if the Merger Transactions are completed?
As a condition to the completion of the Merger Transactions, immediately prior to the company merger,
the Class B Holders will exchange all of their shares of Ranger Class B common stock and Opco common
units for shares of Ranger Class A common stock in the Opco Unit Exchange. As a result, no shares of
Ranger Class B common stock will be outstanding following the Opco Unit Exchange and immediately
prior to the merger effective time. Under the Merger Agreement, at the merger effective time, each
eligible share will be converted into the right to receive (i) 7.49 validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable Baytex common shares (the “share consideration”) and (ii) $13.31 in cash, without interest
(the “cash consideration” and, together with the share consideration, the “merger consideration”). Each
holder of Ranger Class A common stock will receive cash (without interest) in lieu of any fractional
Baytex common shares that such shareholder would otherwise receive as share consideration in the
Merger Transactions.
The share consideration is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of Ranger Class
A common stock or Baytex common shares prior to the merger effective time. The Baytex common shares
are currently listed on the NYSE and TSX under the symbol “BTE.” Based on the number of shares of
Ranger common stock, shares of Ranger Class A common stock issuable pursuant to Ranger equity
awards and Baytex common shares, in each case, outstanding on May 17, 2023, at the merger effective
time, former Ranger shareholders and holders of Ranger’s equity awards, collectively, are expected to
own approximately 37% of the outstanding Baytex common shares, and holders of Baytex common
shares immediately prior to the Merger Transactions will own approximately 63% of the outstanding
Baytex common shares, including for these purposes, the shares underlying the Converted Baytex
TRSU awards. Ranger Class A common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “ROCC.”
When the company merger is completed, the Ranger Class A common stock will cease to be traded on
the NASDAQ and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. Ranger encourages you to obtain
current quotes for the Baytex common shares and the Ranger Class A common stock.
Because Baytex will issue a fixed number of Baytex common shares in exchange for each share of Ranger
Class A common stock, the value of the merger consideration that Ranger shareholders will receive in
the Merger Transactions will depend on the market price of Baytex common shares at the merger
effective time and will not be known at the time that Ranger shareholders vote on the Merger
Transactions. The market price of Baytex common shares that Ranger shareholders receive at the merger
effective time could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of Baytex common shares
on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the Ranger special meeting. Based on
the closing price of Baytex common shares of $4.31 on the NYSE on February 27, 2023, the last full
trading day prior to the day on which the company merger was announced, the implied value of the
merger consideration to Ranger shareholders was approximately $45.59 per share of Ranger Class A
common stock. On May 17, 2023, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, the closing price of Baytex common shares on the NYSE was $3.35 per share,
resulting in an implied value of the merger consideration to Ranger shareholders of $38.40 per share of
Ranger Class A common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in oil and natural gas prices,
Baytex’s or Ranger’s respective businesses, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations and
general business, market, industry or economic conditions. However, the merger consideration will be
equitably adjusted to provide Ranger and Baytex shareholders with the same economic effect as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement in the event of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger or other similar transaction
involving Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares prior to the merger effective time.
For more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by Ranger shareholders if the
Merger Transactions are completed, see the section entitled “The Merger - Merger Consideration” on
page 44.
What will holders of Ranger equity awards receive in the company merger?
Each Ranger TRSU award, other than any Ranger Director TRSU award, and each Ranger PBRSU award,
in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be converted into
Converted Baytex TRSU awards at the closing, with the number of Baytex common shares subject to the
Converted Baytex TRSU awards equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ranger common
stock subject to such Ranger TRSU award or Ranger PBRSU award (at the maximum level of
performance), as applicable, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the cash consideration divided by the
volume weighted average price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE for the five consecutive
trading days immediately prior to the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (y) the share
consideration, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share. Converted Baytex TRSU awards
in respect of Ranger TRSU awards will remain subject to the same vesting schedule and Converted
Baytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger PBRSU awards will be converted based on the number of
shares payable upon maximum performance and will remain subject to the same time-vesting schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon (i) an involuntary termination of the holder’s employment or
service by Baytex, Ranger or any of their subsidiaries without “Cause”  (as defined in the Ranger Equity
Plan) or (ii) solely with respect to a Converted Baytex TRSU award that was converted from a Ranger
equity award that had such a provision in the award agreement pursuant to which such Ranger equity
award was granted, a resignation by the holder for “Good Reason”  (as defined in such applicable award
agreement), in each case, that occurs on or within 12 months following the merger effective time, such
awards will immediately vest in full as of such termination date.
Any dividend equivalents that have been accrued with respect to Ranger equity awards will become
payable ratably if and when such underlying Converted Baytex TRSU award vests.
Each Ranger Director TRSU award will vest in full at the merger effective time and, by virtue of the
occurrence of the closing, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, without interest, the
merger consideration with respect to each share of Ranger common stock subject to such Ranger
Director TRSU award plus the amount of any dividend equivalents payable with respect to such Ranger
Director TRSU award that remain unpaid as of the merger effective time. No fractional Baytex common
share will be issued in respect of a Ranger Director TRSU award, and any such fractional Baytex
common share will instead be paid in cash.
For additional information regarding the treatment of Ranger equity awards, please see “The Merger
Agreement - Treatment of Ranger Equity Awards.”
How do I vote my shares of Ranger common stock?

your proxy before the Ranger special meeting in one of the following ways:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank
or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee to
ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. In this regard, you
must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares or, if you
wish to virtually attend the Ranger special meeting and vote online, obtain a proxy from your broker,
bank or nominee.
How does the Ranger board recommend that I vote at the Ranger special meeting?
The Ranger board unanimously makes the following recommendations with respect to each of the
Ranger Proposals:
“FOR” the Ranger Merger Proposal;
“FOR” the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal; and
“FOR” the Ranger Adjournment Proposal.
For additional information regarding the recommendation of the Ranger board, please see “The
Merger - Recommendation of the Ranger Board; Ranger’s Reasons for the Merger Transactions.”
If my Ranger common stock is represented by physical stock certificates, should I send my stock certificates
now?
No. If you own your shares of Ranger common stock in certificated form, you will receive a transmittal
form from the exchange agent after the Merger Transactions are completed with instructions for the
surrender of your Ranger stock certificates. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
What happens if the Merger Transactions are not completed?
If the Ranger Merger Proposal is not approved by Ranger shareholders or the Baytex share issuance
resolution is not approved by the Baytex shareholders, or if the Merger Transactions are not completed
for any other reason, Ranger shareholders will not receive the merger consideration or any other
consideration in connection with the Merger Transactions, and their Ranger common stock will remain
outstanding.
If the Merger Transactions are not completed, Baytex and Ranger will each remain public companies
independent of one another, the Ranger Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on
the NASDAQ under the symbol “ROCC,” and the Baytex common shares will continue to trade on the
NYSE and TSX under the symbol “BTE.”
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Ranger may be required to pay
Baytex a termination payment of $60.0 million. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified
circumstances, Baytex may be required to pay Ranger a termination payment of $100.0 million. See the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement” on page 140 for a more
detailed discussion of the termination payments.
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal?
Under SEC rules, Ranger is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote of its shareholders with
respect to the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Ranger’s named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.
What happens if Ranger shareholders do not approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal?
Because the vote to approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal is advisory in nature, the
outcome of the vote will not be binding upon Ranger or the combined company, and the completion of
the Merger Transactions are not conditioned or dependent upon the approval of the Ranger
Compensation Advisory Proposal. Accordingly, the compensation that is subject to the vote, which is
described in the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Ranger’s Directors and Executive Officers in

the Merger” on page 79 of this proxy statement/prospectus, may be paid to Ranger’s named executive
officers even if Ranger’s shareholders do not approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal.
What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a shareholder who holds Ranger common stock in
street name?
Shareholders of Record. If your shares of Ranger common stock are registered in your name with
Ranger’s transfer agent, AST, you are a shareholder of record with respect to those shares and the
proxy materials were sent directly to you.
Street Name Holders. If you hold your shares in an account at a bank, broker or other nominee, then you
are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name.” The proxy materials were forwarded to you by
your bank, broker or other nominee, who is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting
at the Ranger special meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or
other nominee on how to vote the shares held in your account.
If my shares of Ranger common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my
bank, broker or other nominee automatically vote those shares for me?
Under the rules of the NASDAQ, if you fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote,
your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Ranger common stock
with respect to “routine” matters. All of the proposals scheduled for consideration at the Ranger special
meeting are “non-routine” matters. As a result, if you fail to provide voting instructions to your broker,
bank or other nominee, your shares of Ranger common stock will not be counted as present at the
Ranger special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum and will not be voted on any of the
Ranger Proposals. If you provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee on one or
more of the Ranger Proposals but not on one or more of the other proposals, then your shares of Ranger
common stock will be counted as present for the purposes of determining a quorum but will not be
voted on any proposal for which you fail to provide instructions. To make sure that your shares are
voted with respect to each of the Ranger Proposals, you should instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how you wish to vote your shares of Ranger common stock in accordance with the procedures
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares.
A failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how you wish to vote your shares of Ranger
common stock will not have any effect on the outcome of the Ranger Merger Proposal, Ranger
Compensation Advisory Proposal or the Ranger Adjournment Proposal.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy
statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold
your shares of Ranger common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate
voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of
record and your shares of Ranger common stock are registered in more than one name, you will receive
more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction
card that you receive in order to cast your vote with respect to all of your shares of Ranger common
stock.
If a Ranger shareholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Ranger common stock voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will
vote your shares of Ranger common stock, as applicable, in the way that you indicate. When
completing the proxy card or the Internet or telephone processes, you may specify whether your shares
of Ranger common stock should be voted for or against, or abstain from voting on, all, some or none of
the specific items of business to come before the Ranger special meeting.
How will my shares of Ranger common stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?
If you sign, date and return your proxy card and do not indicate how you want your shares of Ranger
common stock to be voted, then your shares of Ranger common stock will be voted “FOR” the Ranger

Yes. You may change your vote by sending a later-dated, signed proxy card to Ranger’s Corporate
Secretary at the address listed below so that it is received by Ranger’s Corporate Secretary prior to the
Ranger special meeting, or by virtually attending the Ranger special meeting online and voting. You also

and other communications with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to:
Ranger Oil Corporation 
Attn: Corporate Secretary 
16285 Park Ten Place, Suite 500 
Houston, Texas 77084
For more information, please see “Ranger Special Meeting - Revocation of Proxy.”
If I hold my shares in “street name,” can I change my voting instructions after I have submitted voting
instructions to my bank, broker or other nominee?
If your shares of Ranger common stock are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you
previously provided voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the
instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to revoke or change your voting
instructions.
Where can I find the voting results of the Ranger special meeting?
The preliminary voting results for the Ranger special meeting will be announced at the meeting. In
addition, within four business days of the Ranger special meeting, Ranger intends to file the final voting
results of the Ranger special meeting with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Who will count the votes?
The votes at the Ranger special meeting will be tabulated and certified by the inspector of elections
appointed by the Ranger board.
Do Ranger shareholders have dissenters’ or appraisal rights?
No. No dissenters’ or appraisal rights will be available with respect to the company merger or any of the
other Merger Transactions.
Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the Ranger Merger
Proposal?
Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk
Factors” on page 17. You also should read and carefully consider the risk factors with respect to Ranger
and Baytex that are contained in the documents that are incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus.
Do any of the officers or directors of Ranger have interests in the company merger that may differ from or be in
addition to my interests as a Ranger shareholder?
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Ranger board that Ranger shareholders vote to approve
the Ranger Merger Proposal and the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal, Ranger shareholders
should be aware that, aside from their interests as shareholders of Ranger, some of Ranger’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the company merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of Ranger shareholders generally. The Ranger board was aware of and

considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating, negotiating and adopting the Merger
Agreement, in approving the Merger Transactions and in recommending the approval of the Ranger
Proposals.
For more information on these interests and quantification of certain of these interests, please see “The
Merger - Interests of Ranger’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
What happens if I sell my shares of Ranger common stock after the Ranger Record Date but before the Ranger
special meeting?
The Ranger Record Date is earlier than the date of the Ranger special meeting. If you transfer your
shares of Ranger common stock after the Ranger Record Date but before the Ranger special meeting,
you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Ranger special meeting.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies in connection with the Ranger special meeting?
The Ranger board is soliciting your proxy in connection with the Ranger special meeting, and Ranger
will bear the cost of soliciting such proxies, including the costs of printing and mailing this proxy
statement/prospectus. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials
may also be distributed through banks, brokers and other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares
of Ranger common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or
other electronic medium by certain of Ranger’s directors, officers and employees, without additional
compensation.
When and where is the Baytex annual and special meeting?
The Baytex annual and special meeting was held virtually on May 15, 2023. For more information, see
the section entitled “The Merger - The Baytex Annual and Special Meeting and Shareholder
Approval” on page 86.
When is Baytex’s acquisition of Ranger expected to be completed?
Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described under the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Company Merger” on page 139, including
approval of the Ranger Merger Proposal by Ranger shareholders and approval of the Baytex share
issuance resolution by the Baytex shareholders. The Merger Transactions are expected to be completed
in the second quarter of 2023 or early in the third quarter of 2023. However, neither Ranger nor Baytex
can predict the actual date on which the Merger Transactions will be completed, or if the Merger
Transactions will be completed at all, because completion of the Merger Transactions is subject to
conditions and factors outside the control of both companies, including the receipt of certain required
antitrust approvals. The Merger Agreement requires Baytex’s acquisition of Ranger to be completed by
the outside date of October 15, 2023.
What equity stake will Ranger shareholders hold in Baytex immediately following the Merger Transactions?
Based on the number of shares of Ranger common stock, shares of Ranger Class A common stock
issuable pursuant to Ranger equity awards, and Baytex common shares, in each case, outstanding on
May 17, 2023, at the merger effective time, former Ranger shareholders and holders of Ranger’s equity
awards, collectively, are expected to own approximately 37% of the outstanding Baytex common shares,
including the shares issuable upon future settlement of the converted awards, and persons who were

exchange your Ranger Class A common stock for Baytex common shares and the cash consideration.
Your shares of Ranger Class A common stock will, at the merger effective time, be automatically
exchanged for the Baytex common shares and cash (including any cash in lieu of fractional Baytex
common shares) to which you are entitled. If you instead hold your shares of Ranger Class A common
stock in certificated form or in direct registration with AST, then, after receiving the proper and
completed documentation from you following the completion of the Merger Transactions, the exchange
agent will deliver to you the Baytex common shares and cash (including any cash in lieu of any
fractional Baytex common shares) to which you are entitled as merger consideration. More information
may be found in the section entitled “The Merger - Merger Consideration” on page 44.
Will the Baytex common shares to be issued to Ranger shareholders at the merger effective time be traded on an
exchange?
Yes. It is a condition to the completion of the Merger Transactions that the Baytex common shares to be
issued in connection with the company merger be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary listing conditions. The Baytex common shares
currently trade on the NYSE and TSX under the symbol “BTE.” When the company merger is completed,
the Ranger Class A common stock will cease to be traded on the NASDAQ and will be deregistered
under the Exchange Act.
The Baytex common shares to be issued to Ranger shareholders in connection with the Merger
Transactions will be freely transferable, except for Baytex common shares issued to any shareholder
deemed to be an “affiliate” of Baytex under the Securities Act. Baytex common shares to be issued to
Ranger shareholders in connection with the Merger Transactions will not be legended and may be
resold in Canada through registered dealers provided that (i) Baytex is and has been a reporting issuer
in Canada for the four months immediately preceding the trade, (ii) the trade is not a “control
distribution” as defined in National Instrument 45-102 - Resale of Securities of the Canadian Securities
Administrators, (iii) no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or to create a demand for the Baytex
common shares that are the subject of the trade, (iv) no extraordinary commission or consideration is
paid to a person or company in respect of such trade, and (v) if the selling security holder is an insider
or officer of Baytex, the selling security holder has no reasonable grounds to believe that Baytex is in
default of securities legislation. For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger - 
Restrictions on Resales of Baytex Common Shares Received in the Merger Transactions” on page 87.
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the company merger to holders of Ranger Class A
common stock?
The receipt of cash and Baytex common shares in exchange for Ranger Class A common stock pursuant
to the company merger is expected to be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Holders of Ranger Class A common stock are strongly encouraged to consult with, and rely solely

The Ranger special meeting will be held virtually, conducted via live audio webcast on June 16, 2023, at
7:00 a.m., Central Time. The Ranger special meeting is being held to consider and vote on the following
proposals:
the Ranger Merger Proposal;
the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal; and
the Ranger Adjournment Proposal.
Only holders of record of shares of Ranger common stock at the close of business on May 17, 2023 will
be entitled to vote at the Ranger special meeting. All shares represented by properly executed and delivered
proxies will be voted at the Ranger special meeting. On May 17, 2023 (the “Ranger Record Date”), there were
19,009,954 shares of Ranger Class A common stock and 22,548,998 shares of Ranger Class B common stock
(all of which will be converted to shares of Ranger Class A common stock pursuant to the Opco Unit
Exchange prior to the merger effective time) outstanding and entitled to vote.
Holders of Ranger common stock will vote together as a single class at the Ranger special meeting.
Holders of Ranger common stock are entitled to one vote per share of Ranger common stock on all matters to
be presented at the Ranger special meeting. Therefore, up to 41,558,952 votes may be cast at the Ranger
special meeting. All shares represented by properly executed and delivered proxies will be voted at the
Ranger special meeting.
A quorum of Ranger’s shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person or by
proxy, of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Ranger special meeting
constitutes a quorum. Abstentions will be counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-
votes will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Ranger special meeting, unless the
broker, bank or other nominee has been instructed to vote on at least one of the Ranger Proposals.
If a quorum is not present at the Ranger special meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled
to vote who are present or represented by proxy have the power to adjourn the Ranger special meeting from
time to time without notice, other than an announcement at the Ranger special meeting of the time and place
of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum is present. In addition, under the Ranger Bylaws, Ranger’s
Chairman has the power to adjourn the Ranger special meeting for any reason from time to time without
notice, other than an announcement of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, provided that a new
record date is not set. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be
transacted that may have been transacted at the Ranger special meeting.
Approval of the Ranger Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on
the Ranger Merger Proposal. Abstentions, broker non-votes and failures to votes will not count as votes
cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the Ranger Merger Proposal.

The Ranger board has determined that the Merger Agreement and the Merger Transactions

contemplated thereby, including the company merger. The Ranger board unanimously recommends that

Ranger shareholders should be aware that, aside from their interests as Ranger shareholders, Ranger’s
directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger Transactions that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of other Ranger shareholders generally. The Ranger board was aware of such
interests during its deliberations on the merits of the Merger Transactions and in deciding to recommend
that Ranger shareholders vote “FOR” the Ranger Merger Proposal at the Ranger special meeting.
These interests include:
the executive officers of Ranger will be entitled to certain severance payments or benefits and
accelerated vesting of certain equity-based awards in the event of a qualifying termination of
employment following the completion of the company merger;
the Merger Agreement provides for accelerated vesting of equity-based awards held by the non-
employee directors of Ranger in connection with the Merger Transactions; and
certain executive officers and directors of Ranger may have continuing roles after the merger effective
time.
The Ranger board was aware of these additional interests of Ranger’s directors and executive officers
and considered these potential interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger
Agreement and the company merger, in adopting the Merger Agreement and in recommending that Ranger
shareholders approve the Ranger Merger Proposal at the Ranger special meeting. For a further discussion of
the interests of Ranger directors and executive officers in the company merger, see “The Merger - Interests of
Ranger’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 79. Ranger shareholders
should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the Ranger Merger Proposal.",35,35

Under Section 611 of the TSX Company Manual, security holder approval is required if the number of
securities issued or issuable by a listed issuer in payment of the purchase price for an acquisition, exceeds
25% of the number of securities of the listed issuer which are outstanding, on a pre-acquisition non-diluted
basis. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Baytex has agreed to issue 7.49 Baytex common shares in
exchange for each eligible share and $13.31 in cash, without interest and to convert each Ranger TRSU
award, other than any Ranger Director TRSU award, and each Ranger PBRSU award, in each case, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time, into Converted Baytex TRSU awards (as further
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Ranger Equity Awards” on page
123). Accordingly, if the company merger is completed, Baytex anticipates that up to 323,323,741 Baytex
common shares would be issued or issuable in the Merger Transactions, representing approximately
4 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
37% of the then-current issued and outstanding Baytex common shares, including for these purposes, the
shares underlying the Converted Baytex TRSU awards.
Because the number of Baytex common shares being issued in the Merger Transactions will exceed 25%
of the number of outstanding Baytex common shares on a pre-acquisition non-diluted basis, Baytex
shareholders will be required pursuant to Section 611 of the TSX Company Manual to approve the issuance
of such number of Baytex common shares as is necessary under the Merger Agreement, and Baytex will not
be able to satisfy the listing requirements of the TSX unless the Baytex share issuance resolution is
approved.
The actual number of Baytex common shares to be issued or reserved for issuance under the Merger
Agreement will be determined immediately prior to the merger effective time based on the share
consideration, the number of shares of Ranger Class A common stock outstanding at such time and the
number of Ranger equity awards outstanding at such time.

Each Ranger TRSU award, other than any Ranger Director TRSU award, and each Ranger PBRSU award,
in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be converted into
Converted Baytex TRSU awards at the closing, with the number of Baytex common shares subject to the
Converted Baytex TRSU awards equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ranger common stock
subject to such Ranger TRSU award or Ranger PBRSU award (at the maximum level of performance), as
applicable, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the cash consideration divided by the volume weighted average
price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to
the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (y) the share consideration, rounded up to the nearest
whole Baytex common share. Converted Baytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger TRSU awards will remain
subject to the same vesting schedule and Converted Baytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger PBRSU
awards will be converted based on the number of shares payable upon maximum performance and will remain
subject to the same time-vesting schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon (i) an involuntary termination of the holder’s employment or
service by Baytex, Ranger or any of their subsidiaries without “Cause”  (as defined in the Ranger Equity

On February 27, 2023, CIBC, RBC and BNS entered into a debt commitment letter with Baytex providing
for a debt financing transaction, the proceeds of which will be used to partially fund the Merger
Transactions. Pursuant to the debt commitment letters, CIBC, RBC and BNS committed to provide a new
US$1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Baytex new bank facility”) and up to a US$250 million term credit
facility (the “Baytex term loan”), and CIBC and RBC committed to provide a 364-day bridge loan facility in an
aggregate principal amount of US$500 million (the “Baytex bridge loan”).
On April 27, 2023, Baytex closed a private offering of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of
8.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes”) that generated net proceeds of $776.7
million. The gross proceeds of the offering were deposited into escrow pending satisfaction of certain
escrow release conditions, including the consummation of the Merger Transactions. Upon satisfaction of the
escrow release conditions, Baytex intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with
borrowings under its credit facilities, to pay a portion of the merger consideration, to repay indebtedness
outstanding under the Ranger credit facility, to pay any termination payments payable upon any early
termination of Ranger’s hedge agreements, to satisfy, discharge and redeem the Ranger senior notes, to
repay indebtedness owing to any exiting lenders under the Baytex bank facility and to pay fees and expenses
in connection with the foregoing.
At the closing of the company merger, Baytex intends to increase the revolving capacity of the Baytex
new bank facility from the current US$1.0 billion committed amount to US$1.1 billion, with the current
maturity date of April 1, 2026 remaining unchanged, and to amend the facility to provide for the Baytex term
loan, which will mature two years from the closing date of the company merger. As a result of the completion
of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes offering, no borrowings are available under the Baytex bridge loan.

Your Rights as a Baytex Shareholder Will Be Different from Your Rights as a Ranger Shareholder (page 42)
At the merger effective time, each eligible share will be converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration, consisting of 7.49 Baytex common shares for each whole share of Ranger Class A common
stock and $13.31 in cash, without interest. As a result, Ranger shareholders will have different rights once
they become Baytex shareholders due to differences between the organizational documents of Baytex and
Ranger and differences between Virginia law, under which laws Ranger is organized, and the laws of Alberta,
under which laws Baytex is organized. For a summary of the material differences between the rights of Baytex
shareholders and the existing rights of Ranger shareholders, see the section entitled “Comparison of Rights
of Baytex and Ranger Shareholders,” on page 168.

(as defined in “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement”) (whether or not such
Baytex recommendation change is permitted by the Merger Agreement).
For a more detailed explanation of the termination provisions of the Merger Agreement, as well as a
discussion of the effect of termination and potential termination payments, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement,” on page 140.
Your Rights as a Baytex Shareholder Will Be Different from Your Rights as a Ranger Shareholder (page 42)
At the merger effective time, each eligible share will be converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration, consisting of 7.49 Baytex common shares for each whole share of Ranger Class A common
stock and $13.31 in cash, without interest. As a result, Ranger shareholders will have different rights once
they become Baytex shareholders due to differences between the organizational documents of Baytex and
Ranger and differences between Virginia law, under which laws Ranger is organized, and the laws of Alberta,
under which laws Baytex is organized. For a summary of the material differences between the rights of Baytex
shareholders and the existing rights of Ranger shareholders, see the section entitled “Comparison of Rights
of Baytex and Ranger Shareholders,” on page 168.",42,42

The following tables present each of Baytex’s and Ranger’s net income and adjusted EBITDA, Baytex’s
pro forma net income and adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of each such measure of adjusted EBITDA
to the applicable measure of net income, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2022 and three month

presented below has been derived from the audited historical financial statements of Baytex and Ranger as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and from the unaudited interim financial statements of Baytex and
Ranger as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2023, with certain pro forma adjustments to

measure of Baytex and Ranger giving pro forma effect to the Merger Transactions as if the Merger
Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that Baytex uses to
monitor its financial leverage and compliance with financial covenants and is calculated by adjusting net
income or loss for financing and interest expenses, income tax, non-recurring items, and certain unrealized
and non-cash transactions as set forth in the following table. Adjusted EBITDA does not have a
standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS or GAAP and may not be comparable with calculations of similar
measures presented by other reporting issuers. Adjusted EBITDA allows Baytex’s management to evaluate
its financial performance and compare results between periods without regard to capital structure. Baytex
management believes adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in assessing its financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry and the investment community.

Ranger Oil Corp_20230518_DEFM14A_20894462_4669228.Pdf,Summary of Risk Factors,"Summary of Risk Factors (page 17)
The Merger Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement involve risks. In considering the
Merger Transactions, including whether to vote for the Ranger Proposals, you should carefully consider the
information about these risks set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors” on page 17, a summary of
which is set forth below, together with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement/prospectus.
Risks Relating to the Merger Transactions
Because the number of Baytex common shares constituting part of the merger consideration is fixed
and the market price of Baytex common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, Ranger
shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the Merger
Transactions prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions.
The Baytex common shares to be received by Ranger shareholders at the merger effective time will
have different rights from shares of Ranger Class A common stock.
The Merger Transactions are subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and
shareholder approvals as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether
and when they may be completed.
In order to complete the Merger Transactions, Baytex and Ranger must obtain certain governmental
approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions that become
applicable to the parties, completion of the Merger Transactions may be delayed, jeopardized or
prevented and the anticipated benefits of the Merger Transactions could be reduced.
After Baytex’s combination with Ranger, Baytex may fail to realize projected benefits of the
combination, which could adversely affect the value of Baytex common shares.
The announcement and pendency of the Merger Transactions could adversely affect each of
Ranger’s and Baytex’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
Ranger and Baytex will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger
Transactions.
Completion of the Merger Transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain
agreements to which Ranger is a party.
Significant demands will be placed on Baytex and Ranger as a result of the combination of the two
companies.
The unaudited pro forma reserve and production data included in this proxy statement/prospectus is
presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the reserves or production of
the combined company following the combination of Baytex and Ranger.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of Ranger and Baytex is presented for
illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations or financial condition
of the combined company following the combination of Baytex and Ranger.
Baytex or Ranger may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder
approval.
The opinion of Ranger’s financial advisor rendered to the Ranger board does not reflect changes in
circumstances between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger
Transactions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
While the Merger Transactions are pending, Baytex and Ranger are subject to business uncertainties
and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect Baytex and Ranger’s operating
results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, suppliers, vendors or
customers.
To consummate the Merger Transactions and fund the operations of the combined company, Baytex
expects to refinance the Ranger credit facility and senior notes with a combination of new committed
credit facilities and the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes. The debt commitment letters that provide for the
new committed credit facilities contain certain conditions to close.
Failure by Baytex to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives regarding the
combined company’s business may materially adversely affect the future results of the combined
company and the market value of Baytex common shares.
Failure to complete the Merger Transactions could negatively impact the price of the Ranger Class A
common stock, and future business and financial results.
Directors and executive officers of Ranger have interests in the Merger Transactions that may differ
from the interests of Ranger shareholders generally, including, if the Merger Transactions are
completed, the receipt of financial and other benefits.
Except in specified circumstances, if the merger effective time has not occurred by the outside date,
either Ranger or Baytex may choose not to proceed with the Merger Transactions.
As a foreign private issuer, Baytex follows certain home country corporate governance practices
instead of otherwise applicable SEC and NYSE requirements, which may reduce the frequency and
scope of information and protections to which investors are entitled.
As a foreign private issuer, Baytex is not subject to the provisions of Regulation FD or U.S. proxy
rules and will be exempt from filing certain Exchange Act reports, which could result in the Baytex
common shares being less attractive to investors.
Baytex may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant
additional costs and expenses.
Baytex discloses reserves information in accordance with Canadian standards and Ranger discloses
reserves information accordance with U.S. Standards. There are significant differences in the types of
volumes disclosed and the basis from which the volumes are economically determined under U.S.
Standards and Canadian standards, and the difference between the reported volumes under the two
disclosure standards can, therefore, be material.
Baytex is organized under the laws of Alberta and a substantial portion of its assets are, and many of
its directors and officers reside, outside of the U.S. As a result, it may not be possible for
shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. against Baytex, its
officers, or members of the Baytex board.
The Canadian laws and regulations applicable to Baytex and its shareholders may adversely affect its
ability to take actions that could be deemed beneficial to Baytex shareholders.
Resales of Baytex common shares following the Merger Transactions may cause the market value of
Baytex common shares to decline.
The market value of Baytex common shares may decline as a result of the combination of Baytex and
Ranger.
Current Baytex and Ranger shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the
Merger Transactions and will have less input into the management of the combined company.
Ranger and Baytex may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could
result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger Transactions from being completed.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect
on the combined company’s business and operations.

You should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information set forth in
and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, before making a decision on the
Ranger Proposals. As Baytex shareholders following the merger effective time, Ranger shareholders will be
subject to all risks inherent in the business of Baytex in addition to the risks relating to Ranger. The
market value of Baytex common shares will reflect the performance of the business relative to, among other
things, that of the competitors of Baytex and Ranger and general economic, market and industry
conditions. The value of your investment may increase or may decline and could result in a loss.
In addition, Ranger’s and Baytex’s respective businesses are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described, in the case of Ranger, in its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and, in the case of Baytex, in its Annual Report on
Form 40-F and corresponding Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2022, and
subsequent filings with the SEC which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Because the number of Baytex common shares constituting part of the merger consideration is fixed and the market
price of Baytex common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, Ranger shareholders cannot be sure of
the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the Merger Transactions prior to the closing of the Merger
Transactions.
At the merger effective time, each eligible share will be converted into the right to receive 7.49 Baytex
common shares and $13.31 in cash, without interest. Because the number of Baytex common shares that
constitute part of the merger consideration is fixed, the value of the merger consideration will depend on the
market price of Baytex common shares at the merger effective time. The market price of Baytex common
shares has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Merger Transactions and is expected to
continue to fluctuate from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus until the closing date, which could
occur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. Changes in the price of Baytex common shares
may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, crude oil and natural gas prices, general market
and economic conditions, changes in Baytex’s and Ranger’s respective businesses, operations and
prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood that
the Merger Transactions will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the Merger
Transactions and changes with respect to expectations regarding the timing of the Merger Transactions and
regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond Ranger’s and Baytex’s control.
The Baytex common shares to be received by Ranger shareholders at the merger effective time will have different
rights from shares of Ranger Class A common stock.
At the merger effective time, Ranger shareholders will no longer be shareholders of Ranger but will
instead have the right to become shareholders of Baytex. The rights of former Ranger shareholders will then
be governed by Alberta law and by the terms of the Baytex Articles and Baytex By-laws, which are in some
respects materially different than the terms of the Ranger Articles and Ranger Bylaws, which currently
govern the rights of Ranger shareholders. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“Comparison of Rights of Baytex and Ranger Shareholders,” on page 168 for a discussion of the different
rights associated with Baytex common shares and Ranger common stock.
The Merger Transactions are subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals
as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when they may be completed.
Closing of the Merger Transactions is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions
specified in the Merger Agreement, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise
materially adversely affect the completion of the Merger Transactions. These conditions include, among
other
17 TABLE OF CONTENTS
things: (1) receipt of the Ranger shareholder approval; (2) receipt of the Baytex shareholder approval; (3)
effectiveness of the Form F-4 (of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part) in accordance with the
provisions of the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form F-4 having been
issued and remaining in effect and no proceeding to that effect having been commenced; (4) the absence of
any injunction or similar order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger Transactions;
(5) approval of applicable antitrust authorities; (6) the Baytex common shares issuable in the company
merger having been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX,
subject to customary listing requirements; (7) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties,
subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement; (8) compliance by each party in all
material respects with such party’s obligations under the Merger Agreement; and (9) with respect to Baytex,
the absence of a Ranger material adverse effect, and with respect to Ranger, the absence of a Baytex material
adverse effect; and (10) consummation of the Opco Unit Exchange.
The governmental authorities from which authorizations are required have broad discretion in
administering the governing laws and regulations and may take into account various facts and
circumstances in their consideration of the Merger Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings or otherwise seek to prevent the Merger
Transactions. As a condition to authorization of the Merger Transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require
divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of Baytex’s business after the combination of Baytex and
Ranger following receipt of final antitrust approval. Additionally, if the marketing period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the closing can be
delayed until the second business day following the final day of the marketing period (provided that Baytex
may elect to terminate the marketing period early on no less than two business days’ notice to Ranger).
Baytex and Ranger cannot provide any assurance that all required consents and approvals will be
obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required
consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable),
Baytex and Ranger cannot provide any assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents
and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger Transactions. Many of the conditions to
completion of the Merger Transactions are not within either Ranger’s or Baytex’s control, and neither
company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in
completing the Merger Transactions could cause Ranger and/or Baytex not to realize some or all of the
benefits that each expects to achieve if the Merger Transactions are successfully completed within the
expected timeframe. Moreover, if the company merger is not completed by October 15, 2023, either Baytex or
Ranger may choose not to proceed with the company merger, and the parties can mutually decide to
terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval. In addition, Baytex and
Ranger may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances as further detailed in the
Merger Agreement.
In order to complete the Merger Transactions, Baytex and Ranger must obtain certain governmental approvals,
and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties,
completion of the Merger Transactions may be delayed, jeopardized or prevented and the anticipated benefits of the
Merger Transactions could be reduced.
On April 12, 2023 (at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time), the waiting period under the HSR Act expired. The
expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act satisfies one of the conditions of the Merger
Transactions. No assurance can be given that other required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained
or that the required conditions to the completion of the Merger Transactions will be satisfied. Even if all such
consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as
to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals. For example, these consents,
orders and approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to the divisions, operations
or assets of Ranger and Baytex or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the
conduct of Ranger’s or Baytex’s business, and if such consents, orders and approvals require an extended
period of time to be obtained, such extended period of time could increase the chance that an adverse event
occurs with respect to Ranger or Baytex. Such extended period of time also may increase the chance that
other adverse effects with respect to Ranger or Baytex could occur, such as the loss of key personnel. Even
18 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
if all necessary approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of
such approvals. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger - Regulatory Approvals
Required for the Merger Transactions” and “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the
Company Merger,” on pages 87 and 139, respectively.
The Ranger special meeting may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been
obtained and before all conditions to such approvals, if any, are known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Ranger Merger Proposal is approved by Ranger shareholders, Ranger may not be required to seek further
approval of Ranger shareholders.
After Baytex’s combination with Ranger, Baytex may fail to realize projected benefits of the combination, which
could adversely affect the value of Baytex common shares.
Baytex and Ranger have operated and, pending closing of the company merger, will continue to operate
independently. The success of Baytex’s combination with Ranger will depend, in part, on Baytex’s ability to
realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Ranger and Baytex following the company
merger, including operational and financial benefits that Baytex and Ranger believe the combined company
will achieve. The anticipated benefits of Baytex’s combination with Ranger may not be realized fully or at all,
may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that Baytex and Ranger do not
currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that have been made, which include but are not limited to,
increased shareholder returns, enhanced inventory and a lower asset level free cash flow break-even price,
may not be realized. The integration process may, for Ranger and Baytex, result in the loss of key employees,
the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.
There could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Merger
Transactions that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. Coordinating certain
aspects of the operations and personnel of Baytex with Ranger after the combination of Baytex and Ranger
will involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. Additionally, the
integration will require significant time and focus from management following the combination which may
disrupt the business of the combined company.
The announcement and pendency of the Merger Transactions could adversely affect each of Ranger’s and Baytex’s
business, results of operations and financial condition.
The announcement and pendency of the Merger Transactions could cause disruptions in and create
uncertainty surrounding Ranger’s and Baytex’s business, including affecting Ranger’s and Baytex’s
relationships with their existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an
adverse effect on Ranger’s or Baytex’s business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of
whether the Merger Transactions are completed. In particular, Ranger and Baytex could potentially lose
important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in
light of the Merger Transactions. Ranger and Baytex could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and
new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. The attention of Ranger’s and Baytex’s
respective management may be directed towards closing the Merger Transactions, including obtaining
required approvals and other Transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day
business operations of Ranger and Baytex and matters related to the Merger Transactions may require
commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that
might have been beneficial to Ranger and Baytex. Additionally, the Merger Agreement requires each party to
obtain the other party’s consent prior to taking certain specified actions while the Merger Transactions are
pending. These restrictions may prevent Baytex and Ranger from pursuing otherwise attractive business
opportunities prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions. Any of these matters could adversely affect
the businesses of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of Ranger or Baytex
and the market value of Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares.
If the Merger Transactions do not close, the prices of Ranger Class A common stock and Baytex
common shares may fall to the extent that the current prices of Ranger Class A common stock and Baytex
common shares reflect a market assumption that the Merger Transactions will close. In addition, the failure to
close the Merger Transactions may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of Ranger or Baytex
in the investment community and may affect Ranger’s and Baytex’s relationship with employees, customers,
suppliers and other partners in the business community.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ranger and Baytex will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger Transactions.
Ranger and Baytex have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in
connection with the Merger Transactions, including costs relating to obtaining required approvals and, in
the case of Ranger, compensation payments to its executives triggered by the change in control of Ranger as
a result of the Merger Transactions. Ranger and Baytex have incurred significant financial services,
accounting, tax and legal fees in connection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the
Merger Transactions. Additional significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of
coordinating and combining the businesses of Ranger and Baytex. Even if the Merger Transactions do not
close, Ranger and Baytex will need to pay certain costs relating to the Merger Transactions incurred prior to
the date the Merger Transactions were abandoned, such as financial advisory, accounting, tax, legal, filing
and printing fees. Such costs may be significant and could have an adverse effect on the parties’ future
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Ranger will be required to pay to Baytex a
$60.0 million termination payment. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the Merger Agreement is
terminated under specified circumstances, Baytex may be required to pay $100.0 million to Ranger. For more
information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement,” on
page 140.
Completion of the Merger Transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to
which Ranger is a party.
The completion of the Merger Transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain
agreements to which Ranger is a party. If Ranger is unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the
counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the
agreements, or seeking monetary damages. Even if Ranger is able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties
may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Ranger.
Significant demands will be placed on Baytex and Ranger as a result of the combination of the two companies.
As a result of the combination of Baytex and Ranger, significant demands will be placed on the
managerial, operational, and financial personnel and systems of Baytex and Ranger. Baytex and Ranger
cannot assure you that their respective systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the
expansion of operations following and resulting from the combination of the two companies. The future
operating results of the combined company will be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to
manage changing business conditions and to implement and expand its operational and financial controls
and reporting systems in response to the Merger Transactions.
The unaudited pro forma reserve and production data included in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for
illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the reserves or production of the combined company
following the combination of Baytex and Ranger.
The pro forma reserve and production information in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for
illustrative purposes only, is based on certain assumptions, addresses a hypothetical situation and reflects
limited historical reserves and production data. Therefore, the pro forma reserve and production information
is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s actual reserve or production data would have
been had the Merger Transactions been completed on the date indicated or of the future reserve or
production of the combined company. Accordingly, the combined company’s reserves and production may
differ significantly from those indicated by the pro forma reserve and production information included in this
proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial
Information,” on page 148, for additional information.

is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an indication of the results of
operations or financial condition of the combined company after the combination of Baytex and Ranger. In
addition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information included in this proxy statement/​
prospectus is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the Merger Transactions. These assumptions
may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined company’s results of operations or
financial condition following the combination of Baytex and Ranger. Accordingly, the historical information
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information included in this proxy statement/prospectus does not necessarily represent the combined
company’s results of operations and financial condition had Ranger and Baytex operated as a combined
entity during the periods presented, or of the combined company’s results of operations and financial
condition after the combination of Baytex and Ranger. The combined company’s potential for future
business success and operating profitability must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses
and difficulties typically encountered by recently combined companies.
In preparing the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus, Baytex has given effect to, among other items, the combination of Baytex and Ranger,
the payment of the merger consideration and the indebtedness of Baytex on a consolidated basis after giving
effect to the combination of Baytex and Ranger, including the indebtedness of Ranger. The unaudited pro
forma consolidated financial information may not reflect all of the costs that are expected to be incurred by
Ranger and Baytex in connection with the Merger Transactions. For more information, see the section
entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information,” on page 148.
Baytex or Ranger may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder approval.
Certain conditions to Baytex’s and Ranger’s obligations, respectively, to close the Merger Transactions
may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally permissible, either unilaterally or by agreement of
Baytex and Ranger. In the event that any such waiver does not require re-solicitation of Baytex’s or Ranger’s
shareholders or an amendment of this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable, the parties will have the
discretion to close the Merger Transactions without seeking further approval of Baytex or Ranger
shareholders, as applicable.
The opinion of Ranger’s financial advisor rendered to the Ranger board does not reflect changes in circumstances
between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger Transactions.
The Ranger board has received an opinion from BofA Securities, Ranger’s financial advisor, dated
February 27, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to the various
assumptions and limitations as described in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by
the Ranger shareholders was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Ranger shareholders, but has not
obtained an updated opinion as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations
and prospects of Baytex or Ranger, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be
beyond the control of Baytex or Ranger, and on which the forecasts and assumptions used by BofA
Securities in connection with the rendering of its opinion may have been based, may significantly alter the
value of Baytex or Ranger or the prices of the Baytex common shares or of the shares of Ranger Class A
common stock by the time the Merger Transactions are completed. The opinion did not speak as of the time
the Merger Transactions will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion and the
Ranger board does not anticipate asking BofA Securities to update its opinion. The Ranger board’s
recommendation that Ranger shareholders vote “FOR” approval of the Ranger Merger Proposal, however, is
made as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.
For a description of the opinion that the Ranger board received from BofA Securities, see the section
entitled “The Merger - Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc. - Financial Advisor to Ranger” on page 60. A copy
of the opinion of BofA Securities is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
While the Merger Transactions are pending, Baytex and Ranger are subject to business uncertainties and
contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect Baytex and Ranger’s operating results, financial
position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, suppliers, vendors or customers.
The Merger Agreement generally requires Baytex and Ranger to use reasonable best efforts to conduct
their respective business in all material respects in the ordinary course prior to the earlier of the termination
21 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the Merger Agreement and the closing date, including using their reasonable best efforts to preserve
substantially intact their present business organization, goodwill and assets and preserve their existing
relationships with governmental entities and their significant customers, suppliers and others having
significant business dealings with them. In addition, the Merger Agreement includes a variety of specified
restrictions on the conduct of both parties’ businesses, which, in the event the Merger Agreement is not
earlier terminated, expire on the closing date. Among other things and subject to the other terms of the
Merger Agreement and certain other exceptions and limitations, Baytex and Ranger may not, outside of the
ordinary course of business, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of their stock outside of
their equity incentive plans, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property,
dispose of businesses or assets, enter into certain material contracts or make certain additional capital
expenditures. The parties may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement
delay or prevent them from making certain changes, or limit their ability to make certain changes, during such
period, even if their management believes that making certain changes may be advisable. The pendency of
the Merger Transactions may also divert managements’ attention and either parties’ resources from ongoing
business and operations.
Baytex’s and Ranger’s employees, suppliers, vendors or customers may experience uncertainties about
the effects of the Merger Transactions. It is possible that some employees, suppliers, vendors or customers
and other parties with whom Baytex and Ranger have a business relationship with may delay or defer certain
business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with Baytex
or Ranger as a result of the proposed acquisition. Similarly, current and prospective employees may
experience uncertainty about their future roles with Baytex and Ranger following completion of the Merger
Transactions, which may materially and adversely affect Baytex’s and Ranger’s ability to attract and retain
key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact Baytex’s and
Ranger’s operating results, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price.
To consummate the Merger Transactions and fund the operations of the combined company, Baytex expects to
refinance the Ranger credit facility and senior notes with a combination of new committed credit facilities and the
Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes. The debt commitment letters that provide for the new committed credit facilities
contain certain conditions to close.
On February 27, 2023, CIBC, RBC and BNS entered into a debt commitment letter with Baytex providing
for a debt financing transaction, the proceeds of which will be used to partially fund the Merger
Transactions. Pursuant to the debt commitment letters, CIBC, RBC and BNS committed to provide the Baytex
new bank facility and the Baytex term loan, and CIBC and RBC committed to provide the Baytex bridge loan.
On April 27, 2023, Baytex closed the private offering of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes that generated
net proceeds of $776.7 million. The gross proceeds of the offering were deposited into escrow pending
satisfaction of certain escrow release conditions, including the consummation of the Merger Transactions.
Upon satisfaction of the escrow release conditions, Baytex intends to use the net proceeds from the offering,
together with borrowings under its credit facilities, to pay a portion of the merger consideration, to repay
indebtedness outstanding under the Ranger credit facility, to pay any termination payments payable upon
any early termination of Ranger’s hedge agreements, to satisfy, discharge and redeem the Ranger senior
notes, to repay indebtedness owing to any exiting lenders under the Baytex bank facility and to pay fees and
expenses in connection with the foregoing.
At the closing of the company merger, Baytex intends to increase the revolving capacity of the Baytex
new bank facility from the current US$1.0 billion committed amount to US$1.1 billion, with the current
maturity date of April 1, 2026 remaining unchanged, and to amend the facility to provide for the Baytex term
loan, which will mature two years from the closing date of the company merger. As a result of the completion
of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes offering, no borrowings are available under the Baytex bridge loan.
The commitment of the Baytex term loan and Baytex new bank facility are described in the debt
commitment letter. However, Baytex has not entered into definitive agreements for such debt financing, and
the obligation of the lenders to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter is subject to a
number of customary conditions. There can be no assurance that Baytex will be able to obtain the debt
financing under the debt commitment letter. In the event that the debt financing contemplated above is not
22 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
available, other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If Baytex is
unable to obtain debt financing, the Merger Transactions may be delayed or not be completed. Baytex’s
obligation to complete the Merger Transactions is not conditioned upon the receipt of any financing.
Failure by Baytex to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives regarding the combined company’s
business may materially adversely affect the future results of the combined company and the market value of Baytex
common shares.
The success of the combination of Baytex and Ranger will depend, in part, on the ability of Baytex to
successfully execute the combined company’s business strategy. If Baytex is not able to achieve its
business strategy on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the combination of Baytex and Ranger may
not be realized fully or at all, and the combination may materially adversely affect the results of operations,
financial condition, and prospects of the combined company and the market value of Baytex common shares.
Failure to complete the Merger Transactions could negatively impact the price of the Ranger Class A common
stock, and future business and financial results.
If the Merger Transactions are not completed for any reason, Ranger’s ongoing business may be
materially and adversely affected and Ranger would be subject to a number of risks, including, but not
limited to, the following:
Ranger may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on
trading prices of the Ranger Class A common stock, and from Ranger’s employees, suppliers,
vendors, regulators or customers;
Ranger will be required to pay Baytex a termination payment of $60.0 million, if the Merger Agreement
is terminated in certain circumstances, including because the Ranger board has changed its
recommendation in favor of the Merger Transactions;
the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Ranger’s business, and such
restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Baytex, may prevent Ranger from making
certain material acquisitions, entering into or amending certain contracts, taking certain other
specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Merger
Transactions that Ranger would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place;
and
matters relating to the Merger Transactions (including integration planning) will require substantial
commitments of time and resources by Ranger’s management and the expenditure of significant funds
in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations
and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Ranger as an independent company.
In addition, Ranger could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger
Transactions or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce Ranger’s performance obligations under the
Merger Agreement.
If any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect Ranger’s business, financial
condition, financial results and stock price.
Directors and executive officers of Ranger have interests in the Merger Transactions that may differ from the
interests of Ranger shareholders generally, including, if the Merger Transactions are completed, the receipt of
financial and other benefits.
In considering the recommendations of the Ranger board, Ranger shareholders should be aware that,
aside from their interests as Ranger shareholders, Ranger’s directors and executive officers have interests in
the Merger Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Ranger shareholders
generally. These interests include, among others, the potential payment of severance payments and benefits
and acceleration of certain equity-based awards.
23 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
These interests are described in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Ranger’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” on page 79.
Except in specified circumstances, if the merger effective time has not occurred by the outside date, either Ranger or
Baytex may choose not to proceed with the Merger Transactions.
Either Ranger or Baytex may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger effective time has not
occurred by October 15, 2023 (i.e., the outside date). However, this right to terminate the Merger Agreement
will not be available to Ranger or Baytex if such party has failed to fulfill any covenant or agreement under
the Merger Agreement that has been the primary cause of or resulted in the failure to consummate the
Merger Transactions on or before the outside date. For more information, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement,” on page 140.
As a foreign private issuer, Baytex follows certain home country corporate governance practices instead of
otherwise applicable SEC and NYSE requirements, which may reduce the frequency and scope of information and
protections to which investors are entitled.
As a foreign private issuer, in reliance on NYSE rules that permit a foreign private issuer to follow the
corporate governance practices of its home country, Baytex is permitted to follow certain Canadian corporate
governance practices instead of those otherwise required under the corporate governance standards for U.S.
domestic issuers, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as board, committee and director
independence requirements. Baytex is required to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate
governance practices differ from those followed by U.S. domestic companies under the NYSE listing
standards in its annual report filed with the SEC or on its website. Baytex follows Canadian home country
practices with regard to matters such as obtaining shareholder approval for certain dilutive events.
Accordingly, Baytex’s shareholders may not be afforded the same protection as provided under NYSE
corporate governance rules. Following Canadian home country governance practices as opposed to the
requirements that would otherwise apply to a U.S. company listed on the NYSE may provide less protection
than is accorded to investors in U.S. domestic issuers.
As a foreign private issuer, Baytex is not subject to the provisions of Regulation FD or U.S. proxy rules and will be
exempt from filing certain Exchange Act reports, which could result in the Baytex common shares being less
attractive to investors.
As a foreign private issuer, Baytex is exempt from a number of requirements under U.S. securities laws
that apply to public companies that are not foreign private issuers. In particular, Baytex is exempt from the
rules and regulations under the Exchange Act related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and
Baytex’s officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit
recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, Baytex will not be required
under the Exchange Act to file annual and current reports and financial statements with the SEC as
frequently or as promptly as U.S. domestic companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange
Act and Baytex will generally be exempt from filing quarterly reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act.
Baytex will also be exempt from the provisions of Regulation FD, which prohibits the selective disclosure of
material nonpublic information to, among others, broker-dealers and holders of a company’s securities under
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that the holder will trade in Baytex’s securities on the
basis of the information. Further, certain information may be provided by Baytex in accordance with
Canadian law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements under the Exchange
Act. For example, Baytex’s financial statements are currently presented in accordance with IFRS and its
reserves and production disclosure is presented in accordance with the rules of Canadian Securities
Regulators. In addition, disclosure with respect to Baytex annual meetings of shareholders will be governed
by Canadian law. These exemptions and leniencies may reduce the frequency and scope of information and
protections to which you are entitled as an investor.
Baytex may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and
expenses.
Baytex would lose its foreign private issuer status if a majority of its shares are held by U.S. residents
and a majority of its directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents, more than half of its assets
24 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
are located in the United States, or its business is administered principally in the United States. After giving
effect to the Merger Transactions, Baytex believes more than half of its assets may be located in the United
States and U.S. ownership of its shares will increase significantly. As a result, Baytex could experience a loss
of its foreign private issuer status in the future, which would make compliance with certain U.S. regulatory
provisions mandatory. The regulatory and compliance costs to Baytex under U.S. securities laws as a U.S.
domestic issuer may be significantly higher than the costs Baytex incurs as a Canadian foreign private issuer
eligible to use the Multi-Jurisdictional Disclosure System (“MJDS”). If Baytex ceases to be a foreign private
issuer, it would not be eligible to use the MJDS or other foreign issuer forms and will be required to file
periodic and current reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which
are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer, and to report reserve and
production information under U.S. Standards. Baytex may also be required to modify certain of its policies to
comply with the governance obligations of U.S. domestic issuers. Such modifications will involve additional
costs. In addition, Baytex would lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance
requirements on the NYSE that are available to foreign private issuers.
Baytex discloses reserves information in accordance with Canadian standards and Ranger discloses reserves
information accordance with U.S. Standards. There are significant differences in the types of volumes disclosed and
the basis from which the volumes are economically determined under U.S. Standards and Canadian standards, and
the difference between the reported volumes under the two disclosure standards can, therefore, be material.
Baytex’s reserves information that is included in Baytex’s Annual Report on Form 40-F and incorporated
by reference herein have been prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in National Instrument 51-
101 - Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (“NI 51-101”), as adopted by the Canadian Securities
Administrators, and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (“COGE Handbook”). Ranger’s reserves
information has been prepared in accordance with the SEC disclosure requirements set forth in the U.S.
Standards. There are significant differences in the types of volumes disclosed and the basis from which
reserves volumes are economically determined under the U.S. Standards and NI 51-101, and the difference
between reported reserves under the two disclosure standards can, therefore, be material. For example, the
COGE Handbook and NI 51-101 require disclosure of reserves and related future net revenue estimates based
on forecast prices and costs, whereas the U.S. Standards require that reserves and related future net revenue
be estimated using average prices for the previous 12 months and that the standardized measure reflect
discounted future net income taxes related to the company’s operations. In addition, the COGE Handbook
and NI 51-101 permit the presentation of reserves estimates on a “company gross” basis (representing the
company’s working interest share before deduction of royalties) and “company net” basis (after the
deduction of royalties and similar payments), whereas the U.S. Standards require the presentation of net
reserve estimates after the deduction of royalties and similar payments only. There are also differences in the
technical reserves estimation standards applicable under NI 51-101 and, pursuant thereto, the COGE
Handbook, and those applicable under the U.S. Standards, along with NI 51-101 requiring a more granular
product type classification than required by U.S. Standards. NI 51-101 also requires that proved
undeveloped reserves be reviewed annually for retention or reclassification if development has not
proceeded as previously planned, while the U.S. Standards impose a five-year limit after initial booking for
the development of proved undeveloped reserves. Finally, the SEC prohibits disclosure of oil and gas
resources in SEC filings, including contingent resources, whereas Canadian securities regulatory authorities
allow disclosure of oil and gas resources. Resources are different than, and should not be construed as,
reserves. The foregoing is not an exhaustive summary of Canadian or U.S. reserves reporting requirements.
Except for the supplemental reserve information and standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows prepared in accordance with the provisions of ASC 932 included as Exhibit 99.10 to Baytex’s Annual
Report on Form 40-F, all data on oil and natural gas reserves contained in the documents incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus by Baytex generally have been prepared and are presented in
accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook, which are not comparable in all respects to U.S.
Standards or other foreign disclosure standards. As a consequence, except for the reserves information
presented in accordance with ASC 932, Baytex’s reserves estimates and certain production volumes that are
presented on a gross basis may not be comparable to those made by Ranger under U.S. Standards.
25 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Baytex is organized under the laws of Alberta and a substantial portion of its assets are, and many of its directors
and officers reside, outside of the U.S. As a result, it may not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability
provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. against Baytex, its officers, or members of the Baytex board.
Baytex is organized under the laws of Alberta. A substantial portion of Baytex’s assets are located
outside the United States, and many of Baytex’s directors and officers and some of the experts named in this
proxy statement/prospectus are residents of jurisdictions outside of the United States and the assets of such
persons may be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect
service within the United States upon Baytex and those directors, officers and experts, or to enforce
judgments obtained in U.S. courts against Baytex or such persons either inside or outside of the United
States, or to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against Baytex or such persons in courts in
jurisdictions outside the United States, in any action predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
federal securities laws of the United States. There is no certainty that civil liabilities predicated solely upon
the federal securities laws of the United States can be enforced in Canada, whether by original action or by
seeking to enforce a judgment of U.S. courts. In addition, punitive damages awards in actions brought in the
U.S. or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Canada.
The Canadian laws and regulations applicable to Baytex and its shareholders may adversely affect its ability to
take actions that could be deemed beneficial to Baytex shareholders.
Because Baytex is organized under the laws of Alberta, the Ranger shareholders will be subject to
different corporate protections and requirements than a corporation organized under the laws of a state of
the United States. The Baytex By-laws and the Baytex Articles, set forth various rights and obligations that
are applicable to Baytex as an Alberta corporation. These requirements may limit or otherwise adversely
affect the ability of Baytex’s shareholders to take actions relative to their ability as Ranger shareholders.
Provisions of the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada may also have the
effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in Baytex’s management. For example, the
ABCA includes provisions that require any shareholder proposal that includes nominations for the election
of directors to be signed by one or more holders of shares representing in the aggregate not less than 5% of
the shares or 5% of the shares of a class of shares of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting to which
the proposal is to be presented.
The Investment Canada Act requires that a non-Canadian must file an application for review with the
Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry and obtain approval of the Minister prior to acquiring control
of a “Canadian business” within the meaning of the Investment Canada Act, where prescribed financial
thresholds are exceeded. As a “Canadian business,” an acquisition of control of Baytex shares by a non-
Canadian would be subject to a suspensory review if these thresholds are exceeded. Furthermore,
acquisitions of Baytex common shares which exceed certain thresholds may be subject to suspensory review
under the Competition Act (Canada) (the “Competition Act”). This legislation permits the Commissioner of
Competition appointed under the Competition Act to review any acquisition or establishment, directly or
indirectly, including through the acquisition of shares, of control over or of a significant interest in Baytex.
Resales of Baytex common shares following the Merger Transactions may cause the market value of Baytex
common shares to decline.
Based on the number of shares of Ranger common stock and Ranger equity awards outstanding as of
May 17, 2023, Baytex expects to issue or reserve for issuance an aggregate of approximately 323,323,741
Baytex common shares at the merger effective time in connection with the Merger Transactions. The
issuance of these new Baytex common shares could have the effect of depressing the market value for the
Baytex common shares. The increase in the number of Baytex common shares may lead to sales of such
Baytex common shares or the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the
market for, and the market value of, Baytex common shares.
The market value of Baytex common shares may decline as a result of the combination of Baytex and Ranger.
The market value of the Baytex common shares may decline as a result of the combination of Baytex and
Ranger if, among other things, the combined company is unable to achieve the expected growth in
26 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
revenues and earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of
Ranger’s and Baytex’s businesses are not realized or if costs related to the Merger Transactions are greater
than expected. The market value of the Baytex common shares also may decline if the combined company
does not achieve the perceived benefits of the combination as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the
market or if the effect of the combination on the combined company’s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition,
some Ranger shareholders may decide not to continue to hold the Baytex common shares they receive as a
result of the Merger Transactions, and any such sales of Baytex common shares could have the effect of
depressing their market price. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse
effect on the market for, or liquidity of, Baytex common shares, regardless of Baytex’s actual operating
performance after the combination of Baytex and Ranger.
Current Baytex and Ranger shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Merger
Transactions and will have less input into the management of the combined company.
Based on the number of shares of Ranger common stock, shares of Ranger Class A common stock
issuable pursuant to Ranger equity awards and Baytex common shares, in each case, outstanding on May
17, 2023, at the merger effective time, former Ranger shareholders and holders of Ranger’s share-based
awards, collectively, are expected to own approximately 37% of the outstanding Baytex common shares,
including for these purposes, the shares underlying the Converted Baytex TRSU awards. See the section of
this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Ranger Equity Awards,” on
page 123 for a more detailed explanation. Consequently, current Baytex shareholders in the aggregate will
have less input into the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over
the management and policies of Baytex, and Ranger shareholders in the aggregate will have significantly less
input into the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over the
management and policies of Ranger.
Ranger and Baytex may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial
costs and may delay or prevent the Merger Transactions from being completed.
Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have
entered into business combination transactions. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against
these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a
plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger Transactions, then
that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger Transactions from being completed.
Purported stockholders of Ranger and Baytex have sent letters to Ranger and Baytex alleging that the
proxy statement/prospectus contains materially misleading and incomplete statements and demanding that
Ranger and Baytex provide supplemental disclosures under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Ranger and Baytex believe that the allegations in the demand letters are
without merit. Additional demands or lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement and the
Merger Transactions may be received or filed in the future, which may seek (among other relief) to enjoin the
Merger Transactions. Absent new or different allegations that are material or a disclosure obligation under
U.S. federal securities laws, Ranger and Baytex will not necessarily disclose such additional demands or
complaints.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined
company’s business and operations.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from shareholders, customers, suppliers,
consumers and other third parties due to the combination of Baytex’s business and Ranger’s business. Such
litigation may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations or may
cause disruptions to the combined company’s operations.
Baytex and Ranger may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in
light of the combination of Baytex and Ranger.
Baytex’s success after closing the Merger Transactions will depend in part on the ability of Baytex to
retain key executives and other employees with critical skills and knowledge which are crucial for the
27 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
combined company to achieve key milestones and synergy realization. Uncertainty about the effect of the
Merger Transactions on Baytex and Ranger employees may have an adverse effect on each of Baytex and
Ranger separately and consequently the combined company. This uncertainty may impair Baytex’s and/or
Ranger’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly
challenging during the pendency of the Merger Transactions, as employees of Baytex and Ranger may
experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined company.
Additionally, Ranger’s officers and employees may hold shares of Ranger Class A common stock, and, if
the Merger Transactions close, these officers and employees will be entitled to the merger consideration in
respect of such shares of Ranger Class A common stock.
Furthermore, if key employees of Baytex or Ranger depart or are at risk of departing, including because
of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become
employees of the combined company, Baytex may have to incur significant costs in retaining such
individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose
significant expertise and talent, and the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the
Merger Transactions may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the combined
company will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that Baytex and Ranger have been
able to attract or retain employees in the past.
The Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Ranger to pursue alternatives to the
Merger Transactions and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Ranger.
The Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Ranger to sell its business to
a party other than Baytex. These provisions include a general prohibition on Ranger soliciting any
competing proposal. Further, there are only limited circumstances in which Ranger may terminate the Merger
Agreement to accept a competing proposal and limited exceptions to Ranger’s agreement that the Ranger
board will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Baytex the recommendation the Ranger board in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Ranger board makes an adverse
recommendation change and Baytex terminates the Merger Agreement as a result thereof, then Ranger will be
required to pay to Baytex a termination payment of $60.0 million. See “The Merger Agreement - No
Solicitation; Changes in Recommendation” and “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger
Agreement,” on pages 124 and 140, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Additionally, the Class B Holders, representing approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of Ranger
common stock, have agreed, except in limited circumstances, to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and
the Merger Transactions. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger
partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of Ranger or pursuing an
alternative transaction with Ranger either from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if a third-
party acquiror were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price than the per share price
proposed to be received in the company merger.
If a competing proposal to acquire Ranger or Baytex is made, consummation of the Merger Transactions may be
delayed or impeded.
If a competing proposal to acquire Ranger or Baytex is made, the attention of Ranger’s and Baytex’s
respective management may be diverted away from the Merger Transactions, which may delay or impede
consummation of the Merger Transactions. Matters related to such competing proposal, including any
potential related litigation, may require commitments of time and resources of both parties and their
respective representatives, which could otherwise have been devoted to the Merger Transactions.
The financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.
The financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections entitled “The Merger -
Certain Unaudited Prospective Ranger Financial Information” on page 68 were based on assumptions of,
and information available to, the management team of Ranger when prepared and these estimates and
assumptions are subject to uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Ranger and may not be
realized. Many factors mentioned in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks outlined in this

An investment in common shares of Baytex involves a number of risks disclosed in such risk factors as
well as those set forth below.
Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity,
defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect
Baytex’s or Ranger’s current and projected business operations and their financial condition and results of
operations.
Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that
affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry
or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other
similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Although neither
Baytex nor Ranger has deposit accounts with, or is a borrower under or party to any material letter of credit
or any other similar instruments with any financial institution currently in receivership, if any of their lenders
or counterparties to such instruments were to be placed into receivership, they may be unable to access
such funds. In addition, if any of Baytex’s or Ranger’s suppliers or other parties with whom they conduct
business are unable to access funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a
financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations to Baytex or Ranger or to enter into new
commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to Baytex or Ranger could be adversely affected. In
this regard, counterparties to institutions that have entered receivership or experienced liquidity shortages,
may experience direct impacts from the closure of financial institutions and uncertainty remains over liquidity
concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during
the 2008-2010 financial crisis.
Inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously
issued government securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the U.S.
Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25
billion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial
institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for
customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediately liquidity may exceed
the capacity of such program. Additionally, Baytex and Ranger maintain cash balances at third-party
financial institutions in excess of the FDIC standard insurance limits, and there is no guarantee that the U.S.
Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the
future in the event of the closure of such banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely
fashion.
Access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance the Merger
Transactions or Baytex’s post-closing business operations could be significantly impaired by the foregoing
factors that affect Baytex, any financial institutions with which Baytex enters into credit agreements or
arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include,
among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under
various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the
financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for
companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial
services industry companies with which Baytex or Ranger have financial or business relationships, but could
also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally.
The results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of
material and adverse impacts on Baytex’s or Ranger’s current and projected business operations and
Baytex’s or Ranger’s financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but may not be
limited to, the following:
30 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
delayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other
financial assets;
inability to enter into credit facilities or other working capital resources;
potential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require Baytex and Ranger to maintain letters
of credit or other credit support arrangements; or
termination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds
subject to cash management arrangements.
In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less
favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and
operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it
more difficult for Baytex and Ranger to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in
available funding or access to cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact
Baytex’s and Ranger’s ability to meet operating expenses or other obligations, financial or otherwise, result
in breaches of Baytex’s and Ranger’s financial and/or contractual obligations, or result in violations of
federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors
described above or other related or similar factors, could have material adverse impacts on Baytex’s and
Ranger’s liquidity and their current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results
of operations.
In addition, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry
could lead to losses or defaults by Baytex’s or Ranger’s partners, vendors or suppliers, which in turn, could
have a material adverse effect on Baytex’s and Ranger’s current and/or projected business operations and
results of operations and financial condition. For example, a partner may fail to make payments when due,
default under their agreements with Baytex or Ranger, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy, or a supplier
may determine that it will no longer deal with Baytex and Ranger as a customer. In addition, a vendor or
supplier could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity or other risks that are described above as factors
that could result in material adverse impacts on Baytex and Ranger, including but not limited to delayed
access or loss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of the ability to draw on existing credit facilities
involving a troubled or failed financial institution. The bankruptcy or insolvency of any partner, vendor or
supplier, or the failure of any partner to make payments when due, or any breach or default by a partner,
vendor or supplier, or the loss of any significant supplier relationships, could cause Baytex and Ranger to
suffer material losses and may have a material adverse impact on their business.
The additional indebtedness that Baytex expects to incur in connection with the Merger Transactions could
adversely affect Baytex’s financial position, including by decreasing its business flexibility or adversely affecting its
ability to satisfy its debt obligations or achieve its desired credit ratings.
Baytex’s consolidated borrowings were approximately US$0.7 billion as of March 31, 2023. Baytex has
already incurred US$800 million of debt, and expects to incur an additional approximately US$0.4 billion of
debt in connection with the Merger Transactions, as a result of obtaining financing to complete the Merger
Transactions and to refinance debt assumed in the Merger Transactions. Baytex’s pro forma borrowings as
at March 31, 2023, if the acquisition of Ranger had been completed on that same date, would have been
approximately US$1.9 billion, of which US$0.7 billion would have been at variable rates of interest. As of
March 31, 2023, Baytex would have had US$0.6 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Baytex new
bank credit facility after giving pro forma effect to the Merger Transactions and the expected financing.
This increased level of borrowings could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Baytex’s
liquidity and the combined company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.
Also, the combined company’s ability to make payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness will
depend upon its future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial and business
conditions, sufficient cash flow, the implementation of the integration with Ranger and other factors
affecting its operations, many of which will be beyond the combined company’s control.
Accordingly, the amount of cash required to service the combined company’s increased borrowing
levels after the combination of Baytex and Ranger, and thus the demands on the combined company’s cash
resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service Baytex’s borrowings prior to
31 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the combination. If Baytex completes the acquisition of Ranger and obtains control of Ranger but does not
achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the
combined company does not meet current expectations, then Baytex’s ability to service its indebtedness may
be adversely impacted. The increased levels of borrowings after the combination of Baytex and Ranger could
also reduce funds available for the combined company’s investments including capital expenditures and
other activities, and the payment of dividends and may create competitive disadvantages for the combined
company relative to other companies with lower debt levels.
The agreements that will govern Baytex’s indebtedness that will be incurred in connection with the
Merger Transactions may contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain
customary exceptions, restrict the combined company’s ability to, among other things, create liens over its
property, change its line of business and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey
certain of its assets to another person. In addition, some of the agreements that will govern the combined
company’s new debt financings may contain financial covenants that will require it to maintain certain
financial ratios. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the combined company’s control could affect
its ability to comply with these covenants and failure to comply with them could result in an event of default,
which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate repayment obligations. Under these circumstances, the
combined company may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations.
In conjunction with the Merger Transactions, Baytex may issue debt securities that will be rated by
various credit rating agencies. Some of these debt securities’ credit ratings may be publicly disclosed and
could impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, Baytex’s cost of capital.
Baytex’s credit ratings reflect each credit rating organization’s opinion of Baytex’s financial and business
strength, operating performance and ability to meet Baytex’s debt obligations. If any of Baytex’s future credit
ratings are less favorable than anticipated or reduced, Baytex may not be able to sell additional debt
securities, borrow money or refinance its debt, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms
and conditions that might be available if Baytex’s current credit ratings are maintained.
The combined company may be subject to new or additional income or other tax levies that may fluctuate and
impact its results of operations and cash flows.
The combined company and its subsidiaries will be subject to income and other taxes in Canada,the
United States and other jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof or tax rates in the
jurisdictions in which the combined company and its subsidiaries are organized or do business could
adversely affect the combined company’s results from operations, returns to shareholders, and cash flow.
The combined company’s effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in
countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or
changes in tax laws or their interpretation. While Baytex and Ranger believe that they and their subsidiaries
are in compliance with current prevailing tax laws and requirements, one or more taxing jurisdictions could
seek to impose incremental or new taxes, and Baytex, Ranger and their subsidiaries could be subject to
assessment, reassessment, audit, investigation, inquiry or judicial or administrative proceedings by any such
taxing jurisdiction. The timing or impacts of any such assessment, reassessment, audit, investigation, inquiry
or judicial or administrative proceedings or any future changes in tax laws, including the impacts of
proposed regulations, cannot be predicted. Any adverse tax developments, including legislative changes,
judicial holdings, or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on the results of
operations, financial condition, and cash flows of the combined company.
Changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees may increase
the combined company’s future tax liability and adversely affect the combined company’s operations and cash
flows.
From time to time, U.S. federal and state level legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into
law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal and state income tax
provisions currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and development companies. Such
legislative changes have included, but have not been limited to, (i) the elimination of the percentage
depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible
drilling and development costs, (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and
geophysical expenditures, (iv) the
32 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
elimination of certain other tax deductions and relief previously available to oil and natural gas companies,
and (v) an increase in the U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations. For example, the Biden
Administration’s budget proposal released on March 9, 2023, includes an increase in the U.S. federal income
tax rate applicable to corporations from 21% to 28% and an increase in the excise tax on stock repurchases,
originally enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “stock buyback tax”), from 1% to 4%. In
addition, the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have released preliminary guidance that would potentially
cause Baytex’s U.S. subsidiaries to be subject to the stock buyback tax with respect to any share
repurchases made by Baytex under certain circumstances. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will
be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Additionally, states in which the
combined company will operate or own assets may impose new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and
oil extraction. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in U.S.
federal income tax laws or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and oil extraction
could increase the combined company’s future tax liability and adversely affect the combined company’s
operations and cash flows.
The combined company may be subject to additional U.S. federal income tax as a result of the corporate alternative
minimum tax (“CAMT”).
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes, among other things, the CAMT. Under the CAMT, a 15%
minimum tax will be imposed on certain financial statement income of “applicable corporations” in taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2022. The CAMT generally treats a U.S. corporation as an applicable
corporation in any taxable year following a taxable year in which (i) the “average annual adjusted financial
statement income” of the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates exceeds $1 billion for a
specified three taxable year period and (ii) in the case of a foreign-parented multinational group such as the
combined company, such financial statement income of the corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries
and affiliates exceeds $100 million for such period. Based on Baytex’s current interpretation of the rules
related to the CAMT, as well as a number of operational, economic, accounting and regulatory assumptions,
Baytex does not expect the combined company to be subject to the CAMT as a result of the company
merger. However, the combined company’s U.S. subsidiaries may be treated as applicable corporations in
future years. Further, although the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS are expected to release
regulations and interpretive guidance relating to the CAMT, there is currently limited guidance on the
application of the CAMT rules. The application of the CAMT rules is further complicated in the context of
combining the financial statement income results of each of Baytex and Ranger as a result of the company
merger. Accordingly, Baytex’s current expectations regarding the applicability of the CAMT are subject to a
number of uncertainties, and its intended position is not free from doubt. Any significant variance from
Baytex’s current interpretation of the CAMT rules could result in a change in the analysis of the application
of the CAMT to the combined company and its impact on the combined company’s operations and cash
flows.
The combined company’s ability to use Ranger’s existing net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, acquired in the
company merger, to offset future income subject to U.S. federal income tax will be subject to certain limitations.
As of March 31, 2023, Ranger had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $715 million, which
are subject to various limitations. For example, the use of Ranger’s U.S. federal NOL carryforwards generated
on or after January 1, 2018, is generally limited to 80% of Ranger’s taxable income. Additionally, some of
Ranger’s U.S. federal NOL carryforwards expire between 2032 and 2037 while others have no expiration date.
The combined company’s ability to utilize U.S. NOL carryforwards to reduce future income subject to U.S.
federal income tax will also be subject to various limitations, including under Section 382 of the Code
(“Section 382”). Section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that
may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an “ownership change”  (as
determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or
groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of such corporation’s stock, have a
cumulative change in their ownership of more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership
percentage within a rolling three-year period. As a result of the company merger, Ranger is expected to
undergo such an ownership change. Accordingly, utilization of Ranger’s NOL carryforwards is expected to
be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, generally determined by multiplying the
33 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
value of Ranger’s stock at the time of the company merger by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate in
effect during the month in which the ownership change occurs, subject to certain adjustments. This
limitation is expected to be substantial, and although any unused annual limitation may be carried over to
later years, the limitation could result in a portion of Ranger’s NOL carryforwards expiring prior to their
utilization. In addition, if the combined company becomes subject to the CAMT, such NOLs cannot be used
to reduce income subject to the CAMT.
Baytex’s operations are subject to numerous stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that
may expose Baytex and the combined company to significant costs and liabilities.
Baytex’s operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, provincial and local
environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the release, emission or
discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation
and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the health and safety of Baytex’s employees and other
persons. From time to time, Baytex has been, and in the future may be, issued violations from government
entities that its operations have failed to comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such
laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal
penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or
prohibiting some or all of Baytex’s or the combined company’s operations.
Investor sentiment regarding the oil and gas industry may impact Baytex’s access to capital as evolving
environmental, social and governance disclosure standards are attracting increased scrutiny from stakeholders and
could lead to more costly policies and practices being implemented and consequently may adversely affect Baytex’s
financial condition and results of operations.
A number of factors relating to Baytex’s operations, including the impact of oil and natural gas
operations on the environment, the effects of the use of hydrocarbons on climate change, ecological damage
relating to spills of petroleum products during production and transportation, and human rights, could affect
certain investors’ sentiments towards investing in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result of these
concerns, some institutional, retail, and governmental investors have announced that they are no longer
willing to fund or invest in companies in the oil and natural gas industry, or are reducing the amount thereof
over time. Any reduction in the investor base interested or willing to invest in the oil and natural gas
industry may result in limiting Baytex’s access to capital, increasing its cost of capital, and decreasing the
price and liquidity of Baytex’s securities. In addition, more stringent regulation with respect to the
environment (including climate change) as well as increased attention to environmental, social, and
governance (“ESG”) matters may result in restrictions on access to capital, both of which could adversely
impact Baytex’s ability to develop its reserves.
In addition, practices and disclosures relating to ESG matters (including but not limited to climate
change and emissions, diversity and inclusion, data security and privacy, ethical sourcing, and water, waste
and ecological management) are attracting increasing scrutiny by stakeholders. Certain stakeholders are
requesting that issuers develop and implement more robust ESG policies and practices, such as emission
reduction goals and environmental targets. To the extent Baytex announces such goals, they are meant to be
aspirational and Baytex cannot guarantee that it will be able to meet them on the timeline originally estimated
or at all. Developing and implementing such policies and practices can involve significant costs and require
a significant time commitment from the Baytex board, executive management team, and employees of Baytex
and are subject to a number of assumptions, uncertainties, and estimates and rely on scenarios or
projections that may not prove accurate as a result of factors outside Baytex’s control. In addition, failing to
implement the policies and practices, as requested or expected by the Baytex stakeholders, may result in
such investors reducing their investment in Baytex, or not investing in Baytex at all. Baytex’s response to
addressing ESG matters and any negative perception thereof can also impact Baytex’s reputation, business
prospects, ability to hire and retain qualified employees, and vulnerability to activist shareholders. Such
risks could adversely affect Baytex’s business, future operations, and profitability.
Baytex’s business operations, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows have been and may in the
future be materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The initial outbreak of COVID-19 negatively impacted the global economy and led to, among other
things, reduced global demand for crude oil, disruption of global supply chains, and significant volatility
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and disruption of financial and commodity markets. In response to the initial outbreak of COVID-19, many
state and local jurisdictions imposed quarantines and restrictions on their residents to control the spread of
COVID-19. Such quarantines and restrictions resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and
delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects. During
2021 and 2022, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines progressed and most government-imposed restrictions
have been relaxed or rescinded. While the prices of and demand for crude oil have recovered, further
outbreaks, or the emergence of new strains of the COVID-19 virus, could result in the reimposition of
domestic and international regulations directing individuals to stay at home, limiting travel, requiring facility
closures and imposing quarantines. Widespread implementation of these or similar restrictions could result
in commodity price volatility and reduced demand for crude oil and natural gas, which could materially and
adversely affect Baytex’s financial position and results of operations.
Baytex may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation.
Inflation in wages, materials, parts, equipment and other costs has the potential to adversely affect
Baytex’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position by increasing our overall cost structure,
particularly if oil and natural gas prices decline or remain stagnant. In addition, the existence of inflation in
the economy has and may continue to result in higher interest rates, which could result in higher borrowing
costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects.
The ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect Baytex’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
In February 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine and fighting between the two countries
continues. While Baytex has no operations, personnel or assets in either country, the outcome of this
ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable and could lead to further market and other disruptions that
could adversely affect Baytex, such as volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices, supply chain constraints
and disruptions, increased prices for certain raw materials and component parts, instability in financial
markets, higher inflation, changes in currency rates and increases in cyberattacks and espionage. As a result
of this conflict, governments in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and
other countries have enacted sanctions against Russia and Russian interests. Such sanctions, and other
measures, as well as existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such
sanctions, could exacerbate the foregoing risks. Any of these developments could adversely affect Baytex’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Baytex cannot predict whether it will be able to successfully identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage future
acquisitions.
Baytex may, from time to time, seek to expand its business and its operations by acquiring or developing
additional businesses or assets in existing or new markets. Baytex expects to realize strategic opportunities
and other benefits as a result of its acquisitions. However, there can be no assurances as to whether, or to
what extent, such benefits or opportunities will be realized. Baytex cannot predict whether it will be able to
successfully identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional acquisitions, or successfully integrate
any acquired business or assets into Baytex’s business, or to adjust to an increased scope of operations as a
result of such acquisitions. There is a risk that any future acquisitions could adversely impact Baytex’s
operations and results.
Baytex is exposed to foreign currency risks including transaction exposure and translation exposure.
Baytex reports its financial results to the public in Canadian dollars; however, certain of its revenues
and expenses are or will be denominated in currencies other than Canadian dollars, including, following the
completion of the Merger Transactions, those of Ranger. Most oil prices are quoted in U.S. dollars and the
price received by Canadian producers is therefore affected by the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate that
may fluctuate over time. A material increase in the value of the Canadian dollar may negatively impact
Baytex’s revenues. A substantial portion of Baytex’s operations and production will be in the United States
and, as such, it will be exposed to greater foreign currency risk on both revenues and costs to the extent the
value of the Canadian dollar decreases relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, Baytex is exposed to foreign
35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
currency risk as certain of its indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars and the interest payable thereon is
payable in U.S. dollars. Future Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rates could also impact the future value of
Baytex’s reserves as determined by Baytex’s independent evaluator.
A decline in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar provides a competitive advantage
to U.S. companies acquiring Canadian oil and gas properties and may make it more difficult for Baytex to
replace reserves through acquisitions.
Baytex monitors for significant transactional currency risks. In response to fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates, Baytex may utilize various derivative financial instruments and physical sales contracts to
manage its exposure under its hedging program. The terms of these arrangements may limit the benefit to
Baytex of favorable changes in these factors. There is also increased exposure to counterparty credit risk. To
the extent that Baytex’s current hedging agreements are beneficial to Baytex, these benefits will only be
realized for the period and for the quantities in those contracts. In addition, there is no certainty that Baytex
will be able to obtain additional hedges at prices that have an equivalent benefit to Baytex, which may
adversely impact Baytex’s earnings in future periods.
Risks Relating to Investing in and Ownership of the Baytex Common Shares following the Company Merger
The company merger could result in Baytex being treated as a U.S. corporation or a “surrogate foreign
corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation is generally considered to be a tax resident in
the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Therefore, a corporation organized under the laws of the
Canada would generally be treated as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, not a U.S. tax resident) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Section 7874 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, however, contain rules that may cause a non-U.S. corporation that acquires the stock of a U.S.
corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under certain
circumstances (an “inverted corporation”). If Baytex were an inverted corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, among other consequences, it would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its
worldwide income. As a result, dividends paid by Baytex, if any, would be subject to taxation by the United
States as dividends from a U.S. corporation, and any share repurchases made by Baytex may be subject to
the stock buyback tax. Regardless of the application of Section 7874 of the Code, Baytex is expected to be
treated as a Canadian tax resident for Canadian tax purposes. Consequently, if Baytex were an inverted
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code, it could be liable for both
U.S. and Canadian taxes and dividends paid by Baytex to its shareholders could be subject to both U.S. and
Canadian withholding taxes.
In addition, even if Baytex is not an inverted corporation pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code, it may
be subject to unfavorable treatment as a “surrogate foreign corporation”  (within the meaning of Section
7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code) under certain circumstances (a “surrogate foreign corporation”). If Baytex were
determined to be a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of
the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, dividends, if any, made by Baytex
would not qualify for “qualified dividend income” treatment, and U.S. affiliates of Baytex after the completion
of the company merger, including Ranger and its subsidiaries, could be subject to increased taxation under
Sections 7874 and 59A of the Code and the stock buyback tax with respect to any share repurchases made
by Baytex.
Baytex does not expect to be an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and Baytex intends to take this position on its tax returns. However, Baytex has not
sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS as to such tax treatment, and the closing of the company
merger is not conditioned upon achieving, any particular tax treatment or receiving a ruling from any tax
authority or opinion from any tax advisor in regards thereto. Further, there can be no assurance that your tax
advisors, the IRS or a court will agree with the position that Baytex is not an inverted corporation or a
surrogate foreign corporation pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. Baytex is not representing to you that
Baytex will not be an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under Section 7874 of the Code. The rules for determining whether a non-U.S. corporation is an
inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes are complex,

currency risk as certain of its indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars and the interest payable thereon is
payable in U.S. dollars. Future Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rates could also impact the future value of
Baytex’s reserves as determined by Baytex’s independent evaluator.
A decline in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar provides a competitive advantage
to U.S. companies acquiring Canadian oil and gas properties and may make it more difficult for Baytex to
replace reserves through acquisitions.
Baytex monitors for significant transactional currency risks. In response to fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates, Baytex may utilize various derivative financial instruments and physical sales contracts to
manage its exposure under its hedging program. The terms of these arrangements may limit the benefit to
Baytex of favorable changes in these factors. There is also increased exposure to counterparty credit risk. To
the extent that Baytex’s current hedging agreements are beneficial to Baytex, these benefits will only be
realized for the period and for the quantities in those contracts. In addition, there is no certainty that Baytex
will be able to obtain additional hedges at prices that have an equivalent benefit to Baytex, which may
adversely impact Baytex’s earnings in future periods.
Risks Relating to Investing in and Ownership of the Baytex Common Shares following the Company Merger
The company merger could result in Baytex being treated as a U.S. corporation or a “surrogate foreign
corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation is generally considered to be a tax resident in
the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Therefore, a corporation organized under the laws of the
Canada would generally be treated as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, not a U.S. tax resident) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Section 7874 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, however, contain rules that may cause a non-U.S. corporation that acquires the stock of a U.S.
corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under certain
circumstances (an “inverted corporation”). If Baytex were an inverted corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, among other consequences, it would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its
worldwide income. As a result, dividends paid by Baytex, if any, would be subject to taxation by the United
States as dividends from a U.S. corporation, and any share repurchases made by Baytex may be subject to
the stock buyback tax. Regardless of the application of Section 7874 of the Code, Baytex is expected to be
treated as a Canadian tax resident for Canadian tax purposes. Consequently, if Baytex were an inverted
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code, it could be liable for both
U.S. and Canadian taxes and dividends paid by Baytex to its shareholders could be subject to both U.S. and
Canadian withholding taxes.
In addition, even if Baytex is not an inverted corporation pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code, it may
be subject to unfavorable treatment as a “surrogate foreign corporation”  (within the meaning of Section
7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code) under certain circumstances (a “surrogate foreign corporation”). If Baytex were
determined to be a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of
the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, dividends, if any, made by Baytex
would not qualify for “qualified dividend income” treatment, and U.S. affiliates of Baytex after the completion
of the company merger, including Ranger and its subsidiaries, could be subject to increased taxation under
Sections 7874 and 59A of the Code and the stock buyback tax with respect to any share repurchases made
by Baytex.
Baytex does not expect to be an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and Baytex intends to take this position on its tax returns. However, Baytex has not
sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS as to such tax treatment, and the closing of the company
merger is not conditioned upon achieving, any particular tax treatment or receiving a ruling from any tax
authority or opinion from any tax advisor in regards thereto. Further, there can be no assurance that your tax
advisors, the IRS or a court will agree with the position that Baytex is not an inverted corporation or a
surrogate foreign corporation pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. Baytex is not representing to you that
Baytex will not be an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under Section 7874 of the Code. The rules for determining whether a non-U.S. corporation is an
inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes are complex,
36 TABLE OF CONTENTS
unclear, and the subject of ongoing regulatory change. Baytex’s intended position is not free from doubt.
Further, the application of such rules must be finally determined after completion of the company merger, by
which time there could be adverse changes to the relevant facts, law, and other circumstances. Please see the
section entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the Ownership and Disposition of Baytex Common Shares - Tax
Residence of Baytex for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes.”
If Baytex were a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders of
Baytex common shares could be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.
If Baytex is treated as a PFIC within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code for any taxable year during
which a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations - U.S. Holder and Non-U.S. Holder Defined”) holds Baytex common shares (regardless of
whether Baytex remains a PFIC for subsequent taxable years), certain adverse U.S. federal income tax
consequences may apply to such U.S. holder, such as taxation at the highest marginal ordinary income tax
rates on capital gains and on certain actual or deemed distributions, interest charges on certain taxes treated
as deferred, and additional reporting requirements. Under certain circumstances, certain elections may be
available to U.S. holders of Baytex common shares to mitigate some of the adverse tax consequences
resulting from PFIC status.
PFIC status depends on the composition of a company’s income and assets and the fair market value of
its assets from time to time, as well as on the application of complex statutory and regulatory rules that are
subject to potentially varying or changing interpretations. Based on the projected composition of Baytex’s
income and assets, Baytex expects to take the position that it is not a PFIC for the taxable year of the
company merger, but such position will not be free from doubt. Baytex’s PFIC status for the taxable year of
the company merger or any subsequent taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of each such
taxable year, and Baytex cannot assure you that it will not be a PFIC in the taxable year of the company
merger or in any future taxable year. If Baytex were later determined to be a PFIC, you may be unable to make
certain advantageous elections with respect to your ownership of Baytex common shares that would mitigate
the adverse consequences of Baytex’s PFIC status, or making such elections retroactively could have
adverse tax consequences to you. Baytex is not representing to you that Baytex will not be treated as a PFIC
for the taxable year of the company merger or in any future taxable years. Baytex has not sought and will not
seek any rulings from the IRS as to such tax treatment, and the closing of the company merger is not
conditioned upon achieving, any particular tax treatment or receiving a ruling from any tax authority or
opinion from any tax advisor in regards thereto. Further, there can be no assurance that your tax advisors,
the IRS or a court will agree with the position that Baytex is not a PFIC. Please see the section entitled “The
Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations with Respect to the Ownership and Disposition of Baytex Common Shares - Passive
Foreign Investment Company Rules.”
The Baytex common shares are, and will continue to be, traded on more than one market and this may result in
price variations.
Trading in the Baytex common shares on the NYSE and TSX takes place in different currencies (U.S.
dollars on the NYSE and Canadian dollars on the TSX), and at different times (resulting from different trading
days and different public holidays in the United States and Canada). The trading prices of the Baytex
common shares on these two markets may at times differ due to these and other factors. Any decrease in the
price of the Baytex common shares on the TSX could cause a decrease in the trading price of the Baytex
common shares on the NYSE and vice versa.
If Baytex fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing
of its financial reporting in future periods may be adversely affected.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations require that management report annually on
the effectiveness of Baytex’s internal control over financial reporting and assess the effectiveness of
Baytex’s disclosure controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. Effective internal controls are necessary
for Baytex to provide timely and reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud.
37 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If Baytex fails to maintain proper and effective internal controls, Baytex’s ability to produce accurate
financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect Baytex’s business, financial condition
or results of operations. In addition, failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and
controls could lead to fraud or errors in Baytex’s financial reporting and could harm its ability to manage its
expenses or collect on its service agreements. Implementing any necessary and appropriate changes to
Baytex’s internal controls may entail substantial costs in order to modify Baytex’s existing accounting and
information technology systems, may take a significant period of time to complete and may distract its
officers, directors and employees from the operation of Baytex’s business. Any failure to maintain adequate
internal control over financial reporting, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements,
could increase Baytex’s operating costs and could materially impair its ability to operate its business.
Additionally, when evaluating internal controls over financial reporting, Baytex may identify material
weaknesses If Baytex identifies any material weaknesses and deficiencies in its internal control over financial
reporting, or if Baytex is unable to conclude in its annual reports that its disclosure controls and procedures
are effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of Baytex’s financial reports
and the market price of its common stock could be negatively affected, and Baytex could become subject to
investigations by the stock exchange on which its securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory
authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if Baytex fails to
remediate any material weakness, its financial statements could be inaccurate, and Baytex could face
restricted access to capital markets.
The payment of future cash dividends by Baytex may vary depending on various factors and conditions beyond
Baytex’s control and the reduction or suspension of cash dividends by Baytex would negatively impact the market
value of the Baytex common shares.
The amount and frequency of future cash dividends paid by Baytex, if any, is subject to the discretion
of the Baytex board and may vary depending on a variety of factors and conditions existing from time to
time, including, among other things, significant declines and volatility in commodity prices, restricted cash
flows, capital expenditure requirements, debt service requirements, operating costs, foreign exchange rates,
the risk factors included or incorporated by reference herein and the satisfaction of the liquidity and
solvency tests imposed by applicable corporate law for the declaration and payment of dividends.
Depending on these and various other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Baytex, Baytex may
be unable to commence payment of a dividend following closing of the Merger Transactions or such
dividends could be reduced or suspended entirely or made less frequently. The market value of the Baytex
common shares may deteriorate if cash dividends are not paid, reduced or suspended.

The Baytex common shares were delisted from the NYSE, effective December 3, 2020 and relisted on the
NYSE, effective February 23, 2023.
Ranger shareholders will not receive the merger consideration until the merger effective time, which may
occur a substantial period of time after the Ranger special meeting, or not at all. There can be no assurance
as to the trading prices of the Ranger Class A common stock or the Baytex common shares at the merger
effective time. The market prices of the Ranger Class A common stock and the Baytex common shares are
likely to fluctuate prior to the merger effective time and cannot be predicted. Baytex and Ranger urge you to
obtain current market quotations for both the Ranger Class A common stock and the Baytex common shares.
Historically, Ranger had not paid any dividends, until Ranger’s board declared an inaugural cash
dividend on July 7, 2022 of $0.075 per share of Ranger Class A common stock and additional cash dividends
were declared of $0.075 per share of Ranger Class A common stock on November 2, 2022, and March 3, 2023.
The related dividends were paid on August 4, 2022, November 28, 2022 and March 30, 2023 to holders of
record of Ranger Class A common stock as of the close of business on July 25, 2022, November 16, 2022 and
March 17, 2023, respectively. In connection with any dividend, Opco will also make a corresponding
distribution to its common unitholders. The Merger Agreement prohibits Ranger from paying any dividends
to its shareholders without Baytex’s consent except for quarterly cash dividends of Ranger and Opco of
$0.075 per share. Baytex has not paid a dividend in the last three years. On May 5, 2023, the Ranger Board
declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of $0.075 per share of Class A common stock payable May 30,
2023 to Ranger Class A common stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 22, 2023.

The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, at the merger effective time, merger sub will merge with and into Ranger, with Ranger surviving such
merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Baytex. The terms and conditions of the Merger
Transactions are contained in the Merger Agreement, which is described in this proxy statement/prospectus
and attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read the Merger
Agreement carefully, as it is the legal document that governs the Merger Transactions. All descriptions in

Transactions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.
Merger Consideration
The Class B Holders currently hold (i) Opco common units and (ii) a corresponding number of shares of
Ranger Class B common stock. The Class B Holders’ Opco common units (together with the corresponding
Ranger Class B common stock) are exchangeable for Ranger Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.
Prior to the company merger, the Class B Holders will exchange all of their Opco common units for Ranger
Class A common stock, and in connection therewith, their Ranger Class B common stock will be cancelled.
Under the Merger Agreement, if the company merger is completed, Ranger shareholders will be entitled
to receive, in exchange for each eligible share (i) 7.49 Baytex common shares and (ii) $13.31 in cash, without
interest.
The merger consideration will be equitably adjusted, without duplication, in the event of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares involving Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares prior
to the merger effective time, to proportionally reflect such change. In addition, each holder of Ranger Class A
common stock will receive cash (without interest) in lieu of any fractional Baytex common shares that such
shareholders would otherwise receive as share consideration in the Merger Transactions.
Based on the number of shares of Ranger common stock and Ranger equity awards outstanding as of
May 17, 2023, Baytex expects to issue, or reserve for issuance, approximately 323,323,741 Baytex common
shares at the merger effective time. The actual number of Baytex common shares to be issued or reserved for
issuance under the Merger Agreement will be determined immediately prior to the merger effective time based
on the share consideration, the number of shares of Ranger Class A common stock and the number of Ranger
equity awards outstanding at such time.
Based on the closing price of Baytex common shares of $4.31 on the NYSE on February 27, 2023, the last
full trading day prior to the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, the implied value of the merger
consideration to Ranger shareholders was approximately $45.59 per share of Ranger Class A common stock.
The merger consideration provides a premium to Ranger shareholders of approximately 10%, based on
closing share price of Baytex common shares and Ranger Class A common stock on February 27, 2023, the
last full trading day before the public announcement of the Merger Agreement. The implied value of the
merger consideration will fluctuate, however, as the market price of Baytex common shares fluctuates,
because the share consideration that is payable per share of Ranger Class A common stock is a fixed number

Ranger Oil Corp_20230518_DEFM14A_20894462_4669228.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Baytex board and Ranger board, in the ordinary course and consistent with their fiduciary duties,
continually evaluate their respective company’s operations and future business prospects with a focus on
generating long-term value by leveraging assets to create efficiencies, growing free cash flow and returning
cash to shareholders. In connection with such evaluation, the Baytex board, Ranger board and senior
management teams of both companies also review and assess potential strategic alternatives, including
merger and acquisition transactions. As part of such assessment, each senior management team has had
contacts with financial and strategic parties, including other public and private exploration and production
companies, and routinely receives presentations from investment banks and other third parties on potential
merger and acquisition opportunities.
The following is a summary of the events leading up to the signing of the Merger Agreement and the
key meetings, negotiations, discussions and actions by and among Baytex, Ranger and their respective
advisors that preceded the public announcement of the company merger.
Since 2014, Baytex has had a large non-operated acreage position in the Eagle Ford and Baytex had from
time to time assessed strategic transactions related to this acreage position, including through a transaction
with Ranger, which it began to evaluate in September 2022. Baytex commenced review of Ranger and its
assets as part of its normal course business development activities with these goals in mind.
On December 7, 2021, Mr. Darrin Henke, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Ranger, and
Mr. Russell T. Kelley, Jr., Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Ranger, met with the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of a publicly-traded exploration and production company
focused on development in the Permian Basin (“Party A”) to discuss the perceived benefits of a potential
business combination between the two companies, including potential synergies and operations. On the
evening of December 8, 2021, Mr. Henke discussed, among other matters, the potential business combination
with the Ranger board over dinner and, there being no actionable circumstances at that time, Mr. Henke
agreed to keep the Ranger board informed of any developments.
On January 21, 2022, Party A expressed an interest in a potential business combination with Ranger
during a meeting with several members of the Ranger board. Between February and June 2022, Party A and
Ranger’s senior management held several meetings to discuss non-confidential commercial and financial due
diligence of each of Ranger and Party A. Ranger’s senior management intermittently reported the results of
these meetings to the Ranger board.
On January 24, 2022, a publicly-traded oil and natural gas company headquartered in the United States
(“Party B”), met with a member of the Ranger board and expressed an interest in acquiring Ranger. Between
February and October 2022, Party B and Ranger’s senior management held several meetings to discuss non-
confidential commercial and financial due diligence of each of Ranger and Party B. Ranger’s senior
management intermittently reported the results of these meetings to the Ranger board.
In the first quarter of 2022, Ranger began discussions with BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”)
regarding strategic opportunities, including a potential sale of Ranger, and Ranger formally engaged BofA
Securities for such purposes on December 20, 2022. The Ranger board selected BofA Securities to assist with
Ranger’s evaluation of strategic opportunities based on BofA Securities’ experience in transactions similar to
the company merger, BofA Securities’ reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with
Ranger’s business.
45 TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 8, 2022, a publicly traded oil and natural gas exploration and production company (“Party C”)
contacted a member of the Ranger board via telephone. The chief executive officer of Party C expressed an
interest in a potential business combination with Ranger. After additional discussions between the two
parties and on June 16, 2022, Party C and Ranger entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement to facilitate
discussions and the disclosure of information between Party C and Ranger. Ranger’s senior management
intermittently reported the results of these meetings to the Ranger board.
On July 2, 2022, Party A and Ranger entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement to facilitate
discussions and the disclosure of information between Party A and Ranger.
On July 29, 2022, the Ranger board convened via telephone to discuss each of the potential business
combinations, including the expression of interest from each of Party A, Party B, and Party C, none of which
were supported by indicative pricing or any other term. The Ranger board discussed the perceived merits of
each potential counterparty based on Ranger’s senior management’s reports to date and, there being no
actionable circumstances at that time, Mr. Henke agreed to keep the Ranger board informed of any
developments.
On October 30, 2022, Ranger received an unsolicited offer from Party A to acquire all of the outstanding
equity securities of Ranger for $40.14 per share, comprised of $20.00 per share in cash and the remainder in
Party A common shares. Based on the closing price of Ranger common stock on October 28, 2022, the
proposed consideration outlined in Party A’s proposal represented no premium above Ranger’s trading price
at that time.
On October 31, 2022, the Ranger board held a meeting. At this meeting, the Ranger board discussed the
strategic options available to Ranger, including remaining as a standalone company, maximizing return of
capital to its shareholders and commencing a sale process for Ranger. After discussion and based on the
interest shown from various parties during 2022, the Ranger board directed members of Ranger’s senior
management to commence a bidder outreach process, with the assistance of BofA Securities in order to
evaluate third-party interest in an acquisition of Ranger. Based on the unsolicited offer from Party A, as well
as the Ranger board’s consideration of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the Eagle Ford basin, the
Ranger board believed that a sale of the company may have the potential to enhance shareholder value as
compared to continuing to remain a standalone company. Over the course of the following weeks, members
of Ranger’s senior management initiated and prepared for the sale process, with the assistance of BofA
Securities and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“K&E”).
From November 3, 2022 through the end of the year, BofA Securities contacted over 24 potential
acquirors. As a result of these discussions, Ranger executed non-disclosure agreements with 12 potential
acquirors, including Party B, Party D, Party E, Party F, Party I and Party J, each of which is a publicly traded
oil and natural gas exploration and production company, and Party G, an energy and infrastructure private
equity firm. Party C was contacted on behalf of Ranger by representatives of BofA Securities regarding the
sale process, but Party C declined to participate.
Beginning on November 16, 2022, Ranger provided confidential information to each of the parties that
had executed a non-disclosure agreement for evaluation in a virtual data room. Thereafter, certain parties
asked, and Ranger’s senior management responded to, various supplemental due diligence requests.
In the middle of November 2022, Baytex became aware of the Ranger sales process and made contact
with Ranger to express its interest.
On November 18, 2022, Baytex and Ranger entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate Baytex’s
review of Ranger’s confidential information. During the period between November 28, 2022 and December 2,
2022, representatives of BofA Securities and Ranger hosted management presentations, in person or via
videoconference, with each of Baytex, Party A, Party B, Party D, Party E, Party F, Party G, Party H and Party
I. During the course of this process, additional diligence material was uploaded to the virtual data room.
Parties were also given the opportunity to ask supplemental diligence questions of Ranger’s senior
management regarding the diligence materials for the purpose of such bidder’s evaluation.
On December 2, 2022, Ranger provided to each potential bidder a letter setting forth in greater detail the
procedures for the sale process and requesting that initial indications of interest be submitted by December
15, 2022 should such bidder wish to continue exploring a potential acquisition of Ranger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 5, 2022, an initial draft of the Merger Agreement was uploaded by Ranger to the virtual
data room for participants’ review and comment. The draft Merger Agreement included a note that the final
structure of the potential transaction, as well as certain of the deal protection provisions, may be subject to
change based on the identity of the potential buyer, the form, nature and mix of consideration being offered
by such potential buyer and other factors as determined by the Ranger board.
Also on December 5, 2022, Ranger formally engaged K&E to act as its outside legal counsel in
connection with Ranger’s consideration of a potential sale.
On December 7, 2022, the Baytex board held a meeting. At this meeting, Baytex’s senior management
discussed with the Baytex board various merger, acquisition and divestment opportunities and their merits
and provided a presentation to the Baytex board regarding a potential transaction with Ranger. The Baytex
board authorized management to continue their evaluation of Ranger and following the meeting, Baytex
began working with McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (“McDaniel & Associates”) to independently
assess the Ranger reserves in accordance with NI 51-101.
Throughout December 2022, BofA Securities sent daily updates to Ranger’s senior management
summarizing each process participant’s engagement, as indicated by due diligence questions asked,
interaction with Ranger’s confidential information in the virtual data room, and whether the process
participant had requested a telephone call to discuss the financial model. By December 12, 2022, the active
process participants consisted of Baytex and Party A, Party B, Party D and Party J.
On December 6, 2022, Ranger began discussions with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“Wells Fargo”) in
connection with a potential sale of Ranger, and Ranger formally engaged Wells Fargo for such purposes on
February 8, 2023. Wells Fargo provided Ranger with analyses of potential acquirors of Ranger, including the
selected potential counterparties’ financial strength and the advantages and considerations of pursuing a
combination with such parties.
In advance of the December 15, 2022 deadline date for submission of indications of interest,
management of Baytex, with the support of CIBC Capital Markets, continued its due diligence review in
regards to a possible transaction with Ranger. As part of this due diligence review, over the course of several
meetings and discussions, CIBC Capital Markets provided Baytex management with a detailed review of the
strategic benefits and considerations for a transaction with Ranger, including an assessment of financial
performance, asset quality and strategic fit. Following completion of such due diligence review, management
of Baytex, with the assistance of CIBC Capital Markets, drafted a non-binding proposal, which outlined the
principal business terms under which Baytex was interested in proceeding with further due diligence,
analysis and negotiations with respect to a possible transaction with Ranger.
On December 14, 2022, the Baytex board held a meeting at which senior management made a
presentation to the Baytex board regarding a potential transaction with Ranger and its intention to submit a
non-binding proposal for an all-share transaction (the “Initial Baytex Proposal”). Members of management
left for a portion of the meeting so that an in camera session of the independent directors could be held to
allow the independent directors to deliberate on the business of the meeting and any other matters in the
absence of management.
On December 15, 2022, the previously expressed deadline for submission of indications of interest,
Ranger received indications of interest from Baytex, Party A and Party B. The Initial Baytex Proposal
provided for an all-stock transaction at an exchange ratio of 9.3 Baytex common shares for each share of
Ranger common stock, which represented an approximate 10% premium to both the 5-day and 20-day volume
weighted average prices of the Ranger Class A common stock and Baytex common shares. Each of Party A’s
and Party B’s proposals specified an at-the-market transaction, with Party B’s consideration comprised of
30% cash and 70% of its common stock and Party A’s consideration based on the 7-day volume weighted
average price of Ranger’s Class A common stock and comprised of a cash and stock mix allocated at the
Ranger shareholder’s election, subject to a cash cap. Party D maintained that it was continuing to evaluate a
potential transaction through December 15, 2022, but did not submit a proposal. At or prior to the previously
expressed deadline for submission of indications of interest, Party J indicated to representatives of BofA
Securities that such party was no longer interested in participating in the sale process.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 19, 2022, the Ranger board held a meeting at which members of Ranger’s senior
management, BofA Securities and K&E were also present. The Ranger board was provided with, and during
the meeting representatives of BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, updated information on the
Ranger Class A common stock price, the market conditions facing Ranger and other relevant information,
including a summary of the non-binding proposals submitted by Baytex, Party A and Party B, and BofA
Securities’ analysis of the implied value of each proposal on a fully-diluted basis, price protection for the
Ranger shareholders and transactability of each counterparty, including as to certainty of closing,
anticipated regulatory approvals and outstanding legal and financial due diligence. The Ranger board
discussed informing Baytex and Party B that they would need to increase their valuation in order to continue
in the process and the advisability of ceasing negotiations with Party A because the offer implied a discount
of 4.6% to the closing price of Ranger’s Class A common stock on December 15, 2022. Promptly following the
meeting of the Ranger board, and consistent with the Ranger board’s instructions, representatives of BofA
Securities informed Party A that it had been eliminated from the process and informed each of Baytex and
Party B that it should consider increasing the consideration reflected in its proposal. Thereafter, Party B
informed representatives of BofA Securities that it was declining to continue in the process as Party B was
unwilling to increase its consideration.
Between December 19, 2022 and January 5, 2023, representatives of Baytex, including Mr. Eric Greager,
Baytex’s President and Chief Executive Officer, CIBC Capital Markets, and BofA Securities convened via
conference calls to discuss economic terms of a potential transaction that the Ranger board would be willing
to transact on, including whether Baytex was amenable to paying a portion of the consideration in cash in
order to provide immediate and certain value to Ranger’s shareholders.
On December 21, 2022, Baytex submitted an update to the Initial Baytex Proposal reflecting an implied
exchange ratio of 10.5 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock, with 80% of such
consideration payable in Baytex common shares and the remaining 20% payable in cash. Based on the
closing price of Baytex common shares on December 20, 2022, the proposed consideration outlined in
Baytex’s proposal update represented 8.4 Baytex common shares for each share of Ranger Class A common
stock and $8.72 in cash.
On December 27, 2022, Baytex and Ranger entered into a second confidentiality agreement on
substantially similar terms as the November 18, 2022 confidentiality agreement, under which Baytex would be
the disclosing party in order to facilitate Ranger’s review of Baytex’s confidential information in light of the
expectation that Baytex would issue Baytex common shares as consideration in the potential transaction.
On January 5, 2023, Mr. Greager indicated to Mr. Geiser that the Baytex board may be willing to consider
that a greater portion of the merger consideration be paid in cash.
The next day, on January 6, 2023, Messrs. Edward Geiser, Chairman of the Ranger board, and Darrin
Henke, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Ranger, authorized BofA Securities to send, and
BofA Securities so sent, on behalf of the Ranger board a counteroffer to Mr. Greager. The counteroffer
specified an implied exchange ratio of 10.8 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock, with
75% of such consideration payable in Baytex common shares and the remaining 25% payable in cash. Based
on the closing price of Baytex common shares on January 5, 2023, the proposed merger consideration
outlined in Ranger’s counteroffer represented 8.1 Baytex common shares for each share of Ranger common
stock and $11.57 in cash. The counteroffer also specified a price protection mechanic in the form of a 10%
collar on the stock component for the period of time between signing of the Merger Agreement and the
closing of the Merger Transactions. Finally, the counteroffer included a requirement that the Baytex common
shares be dual listed on the TSX and the NYSE prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions.
On January 11, 2023, Messrs. Greager and Geiser spoke by telephone to discuss the terms of the Merger
Transactions. Mr. Greager noted that Baytex was already preparing to list its common shares on the NYSE
and indicated that he would continue to discuss Ranger’s proposed terms with the Baytex board and, based
on a preliminary review of Ranger’s counteroffer, the Baytex board would not accept the collar mechanism.
On January 13, 2023, Messrs. Greager and Geiser again spoke by telephone to discuss the terms of the
Merger Transactions. Mr. Greager noted that, after deliberating with the Baytex board, Baytex’s proposal
48 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
would be revised to reflect an implied exchange ratio of 10.7 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger
common stock, with 21% of the consideration payable in cash. Mr. Greager stated that the Baytex board
would not accept the collar mechanism.
On January 13, 2023, representatives of each of K&E, V&E, Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP, (“BDP”)
and Stikeman Elliott LLP (“Stikeman”) participated in a telephone call regarding legal and process issues for
a U.S./Canada cross-border transaction. That same day, Baytex provided access to a virtual data room
containing certain confidential information to facilitate Ranger’s and its advisors’ financial and legal due
diligence review.
On January 23, 2023, Baytex submitted to Ranger a draft, non-binding letter of intent and term sheet,
including, among other terms, 10.7 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock, with a to-be-
agreed portion paid in cash. The non-binding letter of intent also specified that execution of the Merger
Agreement would not occur until each of Baytex and Ranger publicly released its financial results for the
year ended December 31, 2022 and proposed mutual exclusivity through March 31, 2023 (the “January 23
offer”). In subsequent discussions, representatives of Baytex and CIBC Capital Markets supplemented the
letter of intent by verbally indicating to Ranger and BofA Securities that the cash portion of the
consideration was anticipated to be equal to 25%. Thereafter, Mr. Geiser conveyed Baytex’s proposal to the
Ranger board and discussed a proposed response with certain members of the Ranger board early the
following morning.
On January 25, 2023, Messrs. Greager and Geiser spoke via telephone. Mr. Geiser indicated that, subject
to negotiation of the transaction terms proposed in the January 23 offer, Ranger would be willing to proceed
towards a definitive transaction if the cash portion of the merger consideration were comprised of $14.00 in
cash per share of Ranger common stock and if the number of directors on the Baytex board post-closing
were increased to nine directors, of whom three directors would be members of the existing Ranger board.
Mr. Geiser further specified that the Ranger board did not consider exclusivity to be appropriate at this time.
Mr. Geiser indicated Ranger would memorialize the terms of the discussion in writing for Mr. Greager to share
with the Baytex board. Mr. Greager then provided an update on the status of relisting the Baytex common
shares for trading on the NYSE and stated the expectation that the Baytex common shares would begin
trading the last full week of February.
On January 27, 2023, K&E delivered to V&E a revised draft of the Merger Agreement that was originally
provided to all bidders on December 5, 2022, updated to reflect certain provisions applicable to Baytex. The
revised draft Merger Agreement was otherwise generally consistent with the draft originally uploaded to the
virtual data room.
Also on January 27, 2023, Mr. Geiser, on behalf of the Ranger board, returned comments to Baytex’s
January 23 offer, including the revisions to the terms Messrs. Geiser and Greager discussed on January 25,
2023. Mr. Geiser also communicated that Ranger would be willing to enter into exclusivity with Baytex for a
limited period of 14 days following Baytex’s delivery of a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and of a list
of Baytex’s proposed material terms with respect to a shareholders’ agreement and registration rights
agreement.
On February 2, 2023, V&E delivered to K&E a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and a draft of the
non-binding Investor and Registration Rights Agreement term sheet (“IRRA term sheet”). The draft Merger
Agreement included, among other terms, (i) a statement via footnote that the Support Agreement to be
delivered by the Class B Holders must be delivered within 24 hours of execution of the Merger Agreement
and would not have a fall away provision in the event that the Ranger board changed its recommendation
with respect to the Merger Transactions; (ii) that each party be obligated to convene their respective
shareholder meetings at the same time; (iii) that neither party could terminate the Merger Agreement in order
to enter into a superior proposal and, accordingly, that each party would have to hold a shareholder meeting
notwithstanding a change of recommendation by the Baytex board or the Ranger board and (iv) a condition
in favor of Baytex that there shall have been no material change to the anticipated tax treatment of the
Merger Transactions. Further, the IRRA term sheet specified, among other terms, that one appointee to the
Baytex board be mutually agreed between the parties, that the Class B Holders be subject to certain transfer
restrictions for up to 18 months and other prohibitions that would limit the Class B Holders’ ability
49 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to dispose of their shares and that the Class B Holders be obligated to vote their Baytex common shares
according to the recommendation of the Baytex board.
On February 7, 2023, Messrs. Geiser and Greager met via telephone. Mr. Greager stated to Mr. Geiser
that the highest amount of cash consideration that the Baytex board would be willing to consider was $13.31
per share of Ranger common stock. Mr. Greager also stated that Baytex expected its shares to begin trading
on the NYSE on February 23, 2023. Both Messrs. Greager and Geiser agreed to meet in person for reciprocal
management presentations.
Also on February 7, 2023, Messrs. Geiser and Henke authorized BofA Securities to send, and BofA
Securities so sent, on behalf of the Ranger board a counteroffer to Mr. Greager. The counteroffer specified an
implied exchange ratio of 10.7 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock, with 72% of such
consideration payable in Baytex common shares and the remaining 28% payable in cash, and did not include
a collar mechanism. Based on the closing price of Baytex common shares on February 6, 2023, the proposed
consideration outlined in Ranger’s counteroffer represented 7.6 Baytex common shares for each share of
Ranger common stock and $13.31 in cash.
On February 8, 2023, the Ranger board met via video conference with members of Ranger’s senior
management and representatives of each of BofA Securities and K&E in attendance. At this meeting, among
other things, representatives of K&E reviewed with the Ranger board its fiduciary duties, generally, and in
the context of a potential sale of the company and the necessity for confidentiality in the process.
Representatives of BofA Securities updated the Ranger board on the status of discussions since the Ranger
board last met, including a summary of the sale process and the proposals that Ranger had received, as well
as the discussions with representatives of Baytex in the interim. At this meeting, the Ranger board discussed
the relative stock performance of Ranger relative to its peers and the relative implied exchange ratios of each
of Baytex and Ranger over the last 12 months. Representatives of K&E reviewed the key terms of Baytex’s
February 2, 2023 draft of the Merger Agreement and IRRA term sheet. The Ranger board discussed its
strategy with respect to the Merger Transactions and determined that Ranger’s senior management should
continue to advance its due diligence efforts on Baytex, update its management forecast for each of Ranger
and Baytex to incorporate year end data points, and continue to update the Ranger board between meetings.
Also on February 8, 2023, K&E delivered to V&E a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and IRRA
term sheet. The revised draft Merger Agreement, among other terms, (i) removed the statement that the
Support Agreement to be delivered by the Class B Holders must be delivered within 24 hours of execution of
the Merger Agreement and would not have a fall away provision in the event that the Ranger board changed
its recommendation with respect to the Merger Transactions and provided instead that such Support
Agreement must be delivered within 24 hours of the registration statement on Form F-4 being declared
effective; (ii) included substantially reciprocal representations, warranties and interim operating covenants
for both parties; (iii) included the obligation for Baytex to convene the Baytex special meeting as promptly as
practicable even if prior to the registration statement on Form F-4 being declared effective by the SEC; (iv)
specified that Baytex would only be able to engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to and
ultimately recommend a superior proposal that did not require Baytex to abandon the Merger Transactions
with Ranger and (v) removed the condition in favor of Baytex that there shall have been no material change
to the anticipated tax treatment of the Merger Transactions. Further, the revised IRRA term sheet specified,
among other terms, that two appointees to the Baytex board be mutually agreed between the parties, that the
Class B Holders be permitted to dispose of their Baytex common shares at any time 90 days after the closing
and rejected the concept that the Class B Holders be obligated to vote according to the recommendation of
the Baytex board.
On February 13 and 14, 2023, members of Baytex senior management, members of Ranger senior
management, BofA Securities and CIBC Capital Markets convened at the offices of K&E in Houston, Texas
for reciprocal management presentations.
On the afternoon of February 14, 2023, Mr. Chad Lundberg, Baytex’s Chief Operating & Sustainability
Officer, conducted field visits at Ranger’s operations.
On February 14, 2023, V&E delivered to K&E a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and IRRA term
sheet. The revised draft Merger Agreement, among other terms, (i) included a statement via footnote
50 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that the Support Agreement to be delivered by the Class B Holders must be delivered within 24 hours of
execution of the Merger Agreement and would not have a fall away provision in the event that the Ranger
board changed its recommendation with respect to the Merger Transactions; (ii) rejected that Baytex would
only be able to engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to and ultimately recommend a superior
proposal that did not require Baytex to abandon the Merger Transactions with Ranger and (iii) reinstated the
condition in favor of Baytex that there shall have been no material change to the anticipated tax treatment of
the Merger Transactions. Further, the IRRA term sheet specified, among other terms, that both appointees to
the Baytex board be mutually agreed between the parties and independent and that the Class B Holders be
subject to certain transfer restrictions for up to 12 months and other prohibitions that would limit the Class B
Holder’s ability to dispose of their Baytex common shares.
On February 15, 2023, a special meeting of the Ranger board was held with members of Ranger’s senior
management and representatives of each of BofA Securities and K&E. At this meeting, the Ranger board
discussed the relative stock performance of Ranger against its peers and the relative implied exchange ratios
of each of Baytex and Ranger over the last 12 months. Representatives of BofA Securities also discussed the
state of the equity markets. Representatives of K&E reviewed with the Ranger board its fiduciary duties,
including in the context of a potential sale of Ranger, and the necessity for confidentiality in the process and
prompted the Ranger board to consider whether any undisclosed conflicts of interest existed. There being
none, representatives of K&E then summarized the suite of deal protections in the Merger Agreement and
the status of discussions with Baytex with respect thereto, including the timing of Baytex’s annual and
special meeting, both Baytex’s and Ranger’s ability (or lack thereof) to consider alternative transactions
before and after each of the times the Class B Holders deliver the Support Agreement and each party
convenes its shareholder meeting for purposes of considering the Merger Transactions. The Ranger board
determined that representatives of BofA Securities and K&E should continue to negotiate with Baytex and
its advisors on the substantive terms of the Merger Agreement to narrow the issues raised in the recent
revised drafts of the Merger Agreement.
On February 16, 2023, the Baytex board held a meeting to review the potential transaction with Ranger
and received an update as to the current status of due diligence and negotiations. In addition, the Baytex
board formally approved the retention of CIBC Capital Markets and RBC as financial advisors with respect to
the Merger Transactions. At that meeting, among other things, management provided the Baytex board with
detailed financial analysis and advice in respect of the terms of the proposed transaction and reviewed a
presentation provided by CIBC Capital Markets with respect to same. Members of management left for a
portion of the meeting so that an in camera session of the independent directors could be held to allow the
independent directors to deliberate on the business of the meeting and any other matters in the absence of
management. After due consideration of a number of strategic, financial, operational and other factors, the
Baytex board authorized management to continue discussions with Ranger regarding the possible terms of a
Merger Agreement.
On February 17, 2023, representatives of each of Ranger, Baytex, BofA Securities and CIBC Capital
Markets convened via conference call to discuss the status of the potential Merger Transactions, including
outstanding commercial and financial due diligence.
On February 18, 2023, Ms. Katherine Ryan, Vice President, Chief Legal Counsel and Corporate Secretary
of Ranger, Mr. James Maclean, Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Baytex, and
representatives of each of K&E, V&E, Stikeman and BDP participated in a telephone conference to discuss
the possible timing of the Baytex annual and special meeting, the disclosures required by applicable law in
the management information circular, and the expected timing and availability of the material financial and
operational disclosures that would be included in the management information circular. That same day,
Messrs. Henke and Greager met via telephone to discuss Ranger employee retention, including
compensation, retention incentives, and severance matters.
On February 19, 2023, K&E sent V&E a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and IRRA term sheet. The
revised draft Merger Agreement, among other terms, (i) included the affirmative obligation for Baytex to
convene the Baytex annual and special meeting as promptly as practicable; (ii) specified that Baytex would
only be able to engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to and ultimately recommend a superior
proposal that did not require Baytex to abandon the Merger Transactions with Ranger and (iii) removed
51 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the condition in favor of Baytex that there shall have been no material change to the anticipated tax treatment
of the Merger Transactions. The transmittal also included an initial draft of Ranger’s disclosure letter to the
Merger Agreement.
On February 20, 2023, representatives of each of Ranger’s and Baytex’s senior management, together
with their respective reserves auditors and financial advisors, attended via teleconference a commercial due
diligence call in which each of Ranger and Baytex had the opportunity to ask and answer commercial due
diligence requests.
On February 22, 2023, Ms. Ryan, Mr. Maclean and representatives of K&E participated in a telephone
conference to supplement the legal due diligence efforts conducted to date via written materials provided by
Baytex in its internally hosted virtual data room. In addition, Baytex was provided with a draft of Ranger’s
2022 Form 10-K that afternoon.
The morning of February 23, 2023, Baytex common shares began trading on the NYSE under the symbol
“BTE”. That same day, the Baytex board held a meeting to review the proposed Merger Transactions, with
representatives from each of CIBC Capital Markets, RBC, BDP and V&E in attendance. At the meeting,
among other things, CIBC Capital Markets provided an analysis of an acquisition of Ranger as well as a
discussion of key terms of the Merger Agreement, market conditions, commodity price outlook, the
performance of each of Baytex and Ranger relative to their respective peers, metrics from similar acquisition
transactions, strategic rationale for the proposed transaction and related considerations, trading metrics of
peers of Baytex and Ranger, financial and operational forecasts of each company and as a combined
company that were prepared by the Baytex management team, and a detailed value and transaction analysis
of the proposed transaction having regard to various metrics and considerations. RBC reviewed a
presentation with the Baytex board on the proposed Merger Transactions, including the expected market
reaction, the potential introduction of a dividend, how to address the share position held by the Class B
Holders post-closing and how the Merger Transactions would compare to recent similar transactions. V&E
reviewed the key terms of the Merger Agreement, IRRA and Support Agreement with the Baytex board. BDP
reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties with respect to the proposed Merger Transactions and the process
undertaken to date. BDP further reviewed the deal protection provisions included in the Merger Agreement
including those being sought by Ranger.
Also on February 23, 2023, Messrs. Geiser, Henke, Greager and Mark R. Bly, Chair of the Baytex board,
met via videoconference to discuss the terms proposed in K&E’s February 19 draft of the Merger Agreement,
including perceived deal certainty to each of Baytex and Ranger, the Support Agreement, the composition of
the Baytex board following the closing of the Merger Transactions, and Baytex’s ongoing tax analysis with
regard to the structure of the proposed Merger Transactions. That same day, Mr. Greager, on behalf of the
Baytex board, called Mr. Geiser to convey a further revised offer on behalf of the Baytex board. The revised
offer specified an implied exchange ratio of 10.6 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock,
with 70% of such consideration payable in Baytex common shares and the remaining 30% payable in cash.
Based on the closing price of Baytex common shares on February 24, 2023, the proposed consideration
outlined in Baytex’s revised offer represented 7.49 Baytex common shares for each share of Ranger common
stock and $13.31 in cash.
On February 24, 2023, V&E sent K&E a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and an initial draft of the
IRRA. The revised draft Merger Agreement, among other terms, (i) included the affirmation via footnote that
the Support Agreement to be delivered by the Class B Holders must be delivered within 24 hours of
execution of the Merger Agreement and would not have a fall away provision in the event that the Ranger
Board changed its recommendation with respect to the Merger Transactions; (ii) included the obligation for
Baytex to convene the Baytex annual and special meeting no later than the 45  day following the date the
registration statement on Form F-4 is filed with the SEC; (iii) set the Ranger termination fee at $60 million and
Baytex termination fee at $90 million; and (iv) included the provision that Baytex would only be able to
engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to and ultimately recommend a superior proposal that
did not require Baytex to abandon the Merger Transactions with Ranger. On the morning of February 25,
2023, the Ranger board called a special meeting via video conference, with members of Ranger’s senior
management and representatives of each of BofA Securities and K&E in attendance. A representative of
K&E provided the Ranger board with a summary of the transaction documents, including a summary of the
material changes to the Merger Agreement since the meeting of the Ranger board on February 15, 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the request of the Ranger board, BofA Securities reviewed its preliminary financial analysis, including
that the proposed implied exchange ratio of 10.6x (comprised of $13.31 in cash and 7.49 Baytex common
shares in exchange for one share of Ranger common stock) would result in present value greater than
Ranger’s stand-alone discounted cash flow, both with and without taking into account synergies, and the
analysis of the pro forma combined company.
Also on February 25, 2023, K&E sent V&E an initial draft of the Support Agreement. The draft Support
Agreement included, among other terms, the obligation of the Class B Holders to vote in favor of the
company merger and prior to the merger effective time, complete the Opco Unit Exchange. Further, the
Support Agreement would terminate upon Baytex’s failure to hold the Baytex annual and special meeting for
the purpose of obtaining the Baytex shareholder approval no later than the 45  day following the date the
Form F-4 is initially filed with the SEC.
On February 25, 2023, K&E also sent V&E a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft
Merger Agreement, among other terms, (i) included that the Support Agreement to be delivered by the Class
B Holders must be delivered within 24 hours of execution of the Merger Agreement; (ii) included the
obligation of Baytex to convene the Baytex annual and special meeting no later than the 45  day following
the date the registration statement on Form F-4 is filed with the SEC; and (iii) set the parent termination fee at
$100 million and included the company termination fee at $60 million.
On February 26, 2023, Messrs. Geiser and Greager spoke via telephone. Mr. Geiser indicated, on behalf
of the Ranger board, that the deal protection provisions reflected in the February 24 draft Merger Agreement
and February 25 draft Support Agreement were generally acceptable. With respect to the IRRA, Mr. Geiser
also communicated that the two appointees to the Baytex board would be mutually agreed between the
parties and not affiliated with the Class B Holders and that the Class B Holders could not be obligated to
vote in favor of a change of control transaction in respect of Baytex. Mr. Greager indicated he understood
the position of the Class B Holders and would discuss with the Baytex board to facilitate finalizing the draft
IRRA.
Later that day, the Baytex board held a meeting to review and consider the Merger Transactions on the
basis of 7.49 Baytex common shares and $13.31 in cash, without interest for each share of Ranger common
stock. Following deliberations, the Baytex board approved the Merger Transactions subject to finalization of
the transaction documents in form satisfactory to Baytex and delegated to Messrs. Bly and Greager on
behalf of Baytex, the authority to negotiate and, if appropriate, agree to the final terms of the transaction
documents with the assistance of legal counsel.
Over the course of February 26, representatives of each of Ranger and Baytex senior management, V&E,
K&E, Stikeman, and BDP finalized the Merger Agreement, disclosure schedules and ancillary documents,
including the IRRA and Support Agreement.
On the evening of February 26, 2023, the Ranger board held a special meeting by videoconference at
which members of Ranger’s senior management, BofA Securities and K&E were also present. Mr. Geiser
noted for the Ranger board that Mr. Greager called him to note that the Baytex board was conditionally
prepared to move forward with the proposed Merger Transactions between Ranger and Baytex, subject to
finalization of all documents in a form satisfactory to Baytex, with authority delegated to Messrs. Bly and
Greager, in consultation with Baytex’s legal counsel, to finalize the transaction documents. Because V&E and
K&E were continuing to finalize drafts of the transaction documents, the Ranger board determined to
adjourn until such time that the terms of the transaction documents could be confirmed to the Ranger board.
Following the above-mentioned board meeting, V&E sent K&E revised drafts of each of the Merger
Agreement and the Support Agreement. K&E sent V&E revised drafts of each of the IRRA and the Baytex
Disclosure Letter. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement, among other terms, included a Baytex
termination fee of $95 million, and the revised draft of the Support Agreement, among other terms, would
terminate if, due to a material breach by Baytex of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, Baytex did
not hold the Baytex annual and special meeting to obtain the Baytex shareholder approval no later than the
60  day following the date the registration statement on Form F-4 is initially filed with the SEC.
On the evening of February 26, 2023, the Ranger board again held a special meeting by videoconference
at which members of Ranger’s senior management, BofA Securities and K&E were also present.

Merger Proposal at the Ranger special meeting. The Ranger board unanimously recommends that holders of
Ranger common stock vote “FOR” the Ranger Merger Proposal.
Also at this meeting, BofA Securities reviewed with the Ranger board its financial analysis of the
Merger Consideration and delivered to the Ranger board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of
a written opinion dated February 27, 2023, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to
various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by
holders of Ranger common stock, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
During the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Ranger board met multiple
times to consider a potential transaction and consulted with Ranger’s senior management and its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors. In recommending that Ranger shareholders vote their shares of Ranger
common stock in favor of adoption of the Ranger Merger Proposal, the Ranger board also considered a
number of factors, including the following (not necessarily presented in order of relative importance) which
the Ranger board viewed as being generally positive or favorable in coming to its determination and
recommendation:
Attractive Value and Merger Consideration. The Ranger board considered the attractive value and
nature of the consideration to be received in the company merger by Ranger shareholders, including:
the fact that the share consideration allows Ranger shareholders to participate in the value of the
combined company, including expected future free cash flow, which the Ranger board viewed as an
important opportunity for Ranger shareholders should they determine to retain the Baytex common
shares they would receive as share consideration in the company merger, while the cash
consideration provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to the Company’s shareholders;
the fact that, based on the closing price of Baytex common shares of $5.74 CAD on February 24, 2023
(the last trading day prior to the date of Ranger board’s approval of the company merger), the Merger
Consideration represented an implied value of $44.36 per share of Ranger common stock, a premium of
8.9% to the closing price of the shares of Ranger’s Class A common stock as of February 24, 2023;
the Ranger board’s belief, based on discussions and negotiations with Baytex, that 7.49 Baytex
common shares and $13.31 in cash was the highest price Baytex would be willing to pay and that
Baytex would not be willing to increase the amount of either the share consideration or cash
consideration;
the fact that the Ranger shareholders immediately prior to the company merger would own
approximately 37% of the Baytex common shares immediately following the closing of the company
merger; and
the fact that the share consideration provides for a fixed number of Baytex common shares which
offers Ranger shareholders the opportunity to benefit from any increase in the trading price of Baytex
common shares before the closing of the company merger.
Benefits of a Combined Company. The belief of the Ranger board that the combined company after the
company merger would be well positioned to achieve future free cash flow growth and generate superior
returns for Ranger’s former shareholders, including as a result of:
the uplift in the combined company’s ability to realize additional annualized savings from synergies
and additional tax savings from the step-up in tax basis resulting from the Merger Transactions;
an improved cost of capital due to enhanced scale, increased liquidity and reduced volatility relative
to standalone Ranger;
the talent of certain Ranger employees (including certain senior management members) who are
expected to remain with the combined company, adding valuable expertise and experience and in-
depth familiarity with the combined company’s U.S. assets, which will enhance the likelihood of
realizing the strategic benefits expected to derive from the company merger; and
the quality and experience of the Baytex board members, who are expected to remain on the combined
company board, and the fact that two board members from the current Ranger board are expected to
join the Baytex board of the combined company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Superior Alternative to Continuation of Standalone Ranger. The Ranger board’s consideration of
Ranger’s business, prospects and other strategic opportunities, including:
the Ranger board’s understanding of Baytex’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings,
prospects, competitive position and the nature of the industry in which Baytex competes;
the Ranger board’s understanding of the risks, uncertainties and challenges facing Ranger and the
industry in which each of Ranger and Baytex compete, including the risks that Ranger would face if it
continued to operate on a standalone basis; and
the belief that the risks from industry trends and dynamics could be more effectively mitigated as a
combined company.
Alternative Combination Merger Transactions. The Ranger board considered alternative transactions
and, following a review of such alternatives with the assistance of Ranger’s management and in consultation
with BofA Securities and Wells Fargo, and after taking into account the results of the bidding process
described in the section titled “- Background of the Merger,” believed that it was unlikely that an alternative
bidder would consummate a transaction on superior terms and provide Ranger shareholders more valuable
consideration than provided in connection with the company merger.
Other Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Ranger board concluded, after consultation with Ranger’s
legal advisors, that the other terms of the Merger Agreement, taken as a whole, including the parties’
representations, warranties, covenants and conditions to closing, and the circumstances under which the
Merger Agreement may be terminated, are reasonable.
Opportunity to Receive Alternative Acquisition Proposals. The Ranger board considered the terms of
the Merger Agreement related to Ranger’s ability to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals. In this
regard, the Ranger board considered:
the Ranger board’s process for soliciting offers from third parties that were believed to be the most
able and willing to pay the highest price for Ranger, which included engaging BofA Securities and
Wells Fargo, providing such third parties with an opportunity to conduct due diligence and meetings
with members of Ranger’s senior management, as described above in the section entitled “The
Merger - Background of the Merger,” and that no other acquisition proposals on terms superior to
the company merger resulted therefrom;
the fact that the Class B Holders entered into the Support Agreement, as well as the fact that certain
voting obligations under the Support Agreement would no longer be in effect upon Baytex’s failure to
hold the Baytex annual and special meeting as described in the section entitled “The Merger -
Support Agreement;” and
while the Merger Agreement contains a termination fee of $60.0 million, representing approximately
3% of Ranger’s equity value as of the date of the Merger Agreement, that Ranger would be required
to pay to Baytex in certain circumstances, including if (i) Baytex terminates the Merger Agreement in
connection with a change in the Ranger board’s recommendation to shareholders with respect to
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, or (ii) under certain circumstances, within 12 months
of termination of the Merger Agreement, Ranger enters into or recommends an agreement in respect
of any acquisition proposal, or a transaction in respect of any acquisition proposal with respect to
Ranger is consummated, the belief that this fee is reasonable in light of the circumstances and the
overall terms of the Merger Agreement, consistent with fees in comparable transactions and not
preclusive of other offers under the circumstances described in the foregoing considerations.
Post-Merger Corporate Governance. The Ranger board considered that the IRRA provides that Baytex
shall take appropriate actions to cause to be elected or appointed as a director of the combined company,
Jeffrey E. Wojahn and Tiffany Thom Cepak, or, in the event Mr. Wojahn or Ms. Cepak is unwilling or unable
to serve as a member of the Baytex board at the time of such appointment, then another member or members
of the Ranger board that is determined by the Nominating Committee of the Baytex board to be independent
with respect to his or her service on the Baytex board.
Fairness Opinion from BofA Securities Inc. The Ranger board considered the financial analyses
reviewed and discussed with representatives of BofA Securities, as well as the oral opinion of BofA
Securities rendered
56

TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the Ranger board on February 27, 2023, which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the various assumptions and limitations described
in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of Ranger Class A common stock was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. See below in the section titled “The Merger - Opinion of BofA
Securities, Inc. - Financial Advisor to Ranger.”
The Ranger board also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and other countervailing factors it
deemed generally negative or unfavorable in its deliberations concerning the company merger and the
Merger Agreement, including the following (not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
Fixed Exchange Ratio. The Ranger board considered that, because the merger consideration is based
on a fixed exchange ratio rather than a fixed value, Ranger shareholders bear the risk of a decrease in the
trading price of Baytex common shares during the pendency of the company merger;
Interim Operating Covenants. The Ranger board considered the restrictions on the conduct of Ranger’s
and its subsidiaries’ businesses during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the
completion of the company merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement;
Risks Associated with the Pendency of the Company Merger. The Ranger board considered the risks
and contingencies relating to the announcement and pendency of the company merger (including the
likelihood of litigation or other opposition brought by or on behalf of Ranger shareholders or Baytex
shareholders challenging the company merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement) and the risks and costs to Ranger if the company merger is not completed in a timely manner or if
the company merger does not close at all, including potential employee attrition, the impact on Ranger’s
relationships with third parties and the effect termination of the Merger Agreement may have on the trading
price of the Ranger Class A common stock and Ranger’s operating results;
Baytex Change of Recommendation; Baytex Shareholder Vote. The Ranger board considered the right
of the Baytex board to change its recommendation to Baytex shareholders in certain circumstances, subject
to certain conditions (including considering any adjustments to the Merger Agreement proposed by Ranger
and payment to Ranger of a $100 million termination fee). The Ranger board also considered that, even if the
Merger Agreement is approved by Ranger shareholders, Baytex shareholders may not approve the Baytex
share issuance resolution, which is a closing condition of the company merger;
Opportunity to Receive Acquisition Proposals; Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement. The
Ranger board considered the possibility that a third party may be willing to enter into a strategic
combination with Ranger on terms more favorable than the company merger, even in light of the fact that
Ranger will not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal. In
connection therewith, the Ranger board considered the terms of the Merger Agreement relating to the no-
shop covenant and termination fees and the potential that such provisions might deter alternative bidders
that might have been willing to submit an acquisition proposal to Ranger. The Ranger board also considered
that, under specified circumstances, Ranger may be required to pay a termination fee or expenses in the
event the Merger Agreement is terminated and the effect this could have on Ranger, including:
the possibility that the termination fee could discourage other potential parties from making an
acquisition proposal, although the Ranger board believed that the termination fee was reasonable in
amount and would not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in making an acquisition
proposal;
the fact that Ranger will generally be obligated to pay its own expenses incident to preparing for and
entering into and carrying out its obligations under the Merger Transactions if the company merger is
not consummated, except in the circumstance where the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of
the failure to obtain Baytex shareholder approval of the Baytex share issuance resolution; and
the requirement that if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the failure to obtain approval
of the Ranger Merger Proposal by Ranger shareholders, Ranger would be obligated to reimburse
Baytex for $20.0 million of its expenses in connection with the Merger Agreement;

After considering such matters as it deemed relevant, the Baytex board unanimously: (i) determined,
after receiving legal and financial advice, that the Merger Agreement and the company merger, including the
issuance of the Baytex common shares pursuant to the company merger, are in the best interests of Baytex;
(ii) approved the company merger and the entering into of the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreement
and the IRRA; and (iii) recommended that Baytex shareholders vote in favor of the Baytex share issuance
resolution. The Baytex board unanimously recommends that Baytex shareholders vote “FOR” the Baytex share

The anticipated benefits from the Merger Transactions are primarily derived from the financial and
operational synergies to be realized as a combined entity. The strategic rationale that supported the Baytex
board’s approval of the Merger Transactions include the following (not necessarily presented in order of
relative importance):

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Enhanced Shareholder Returns. Baytex believes that the Merger Transactions will benefit Baytex
shareholders by providing additional free cash flow for enhanced shareholder returns due to the
forecasted increase to free cash flow per share following Closing. Baytex intends to seek to increase
its direct shareholder return to approximately 50% of free cash flow upon closing, through the
introduction of a dividend and an increase in share buybacks. Based on this, following closing of the
Merger Transactions, Baytex management anticipates recommending to the Baytex board that Baytex
declare and pay a quarterly dividend of $0.0225 per Baytex common share ($0.09 per share annualized)
representing a dividend yield of approximately 1.6% based on Baytex's closing share price on
February 24, 2023 of C$5.74 on the TSX.
Builds Quality Scale and Significant Operating Capability. The Merger Transactions materially increase
Baytex’s presence and the scale of its Eagle Ford operations in Texas by adding:
162,000 net acres in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale, highly concentrated in
Gonzales, Lavaca, Fayette and Dewitt counties which is on-trend with Baytex’s current non-
operated position just to the southwest in the Karnes Trough.
Estimated daily average production during the 12 months following the projected closing of the
Merger Transactions of 67 to 70 Mboe/d (working interest) that is approximately 96% operated
(72% light oil, 15% NGLs and 13% natural gas).
254,485 Mboe of proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 (consisting of 169,232 Mbbls of oil,
44,408 Mbbls of NGLs and 245,069 MMcf of natural gas).
On a combined basis, Baytex’s estimated average daily production is forecast to be 155,000 to 160,000
boe/d (74% oil, 12% NGLs and 14% natural gas) during the 12 months following the projected closing
of the Merger Transactions. Increasing Baytex’s presence and scale of its Eagle Ford operations in
Texas is beneficial because Baytex’s current assets in the Eagle Ford are non-operated, and adding
the operated assets and capability of Ranger will provide Baytex with significantly greater ability and
opportunity to optimize its Eagle Ford operations and investments.
Enhances Drilling Inventory. Baytex estimates Ranger’s acreage would support 741 net undrilled
locations representing an inventory life of 12 to 15 years (based on running an average of 2.3 rigs per
year), including 523 Lower Eagle Ford locations and 218 additional Upper Eagle Ford and Austin
Chalk locations.
Creates a Significantly More Resilient Business. On a pro forma basis, Baytex’s operated production
during the 12 months following the projected closing of the Merger Transactions increases to
approximately 82% as compared to 70% in the absence of the Merger Transactions. Baytex also
believes the addition of Ranger’s assets will reduce its asset level free cash flow break-even price by
approximately US$7/bbl to US$41/bbl WTI. Further, the addition of Ranger’s asset base provides
increased exposure to premium U.S. Gulf Coast pricing and increases Baytex’s light oil production in
the Eagle Ford to approximately 42% of pro forma production as compared to 18% in the absence of
the Merger Transactions, which receives WTI pricing plus approximately US$2/bbl price realizations.
Finally, Ranger’s acreage is supported by substantial infrastructure in place with low operating and
transportation costs.
Maintains Balance Sheet Strength and Financial Flexibility. As described under “The Merger - Debt
Financing,” Baytex has completed the offering of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes and it expects to
enter into the Baytex new bank facility and increase the commitments thereunder to US$1.1 billion and
to add thereto the US$250 million Baytex term loan, the proceeds of which will be used to pay a
portion of the cash consideration and refinance Ranger’s and Baytex’s existing indebtedness. Within
45 days of closing the Merger Transactions, Baytex expects to have approximately 40% of net crude
oil production exposure hedged for the twelve-month period post-closing.
Commitment to Strong ESG Performance. Baytex believes that the company merger will result in Baytex
having a reduced average greenhouse gas emissions intensity due to the lower greenhouse gas
intensity Ranger assets being added to the Baytex portfolio.
Disciplined Leadership and Governance. The combined business will benefit from the experienced
leadership of the existing Baytex executive team and the Baytex board. Baytex intends to add one

senior operational leader to the Baytex leadership team and retain the Ranger technical team operating
in Houston. At closing, Baytex intends to appoint Jeffrey E. Wojahn and Tiffany Thom Cepak to the
Baytex board. Familiarity with the Ranger assets at the Baytex board and continuity with the Ranger
technical team will allow for the efficient integration of the Ranger assets into the Baytex portfolio.
Opinion of BofA Securities Inc. - Financial Advisor to Ranger
Ranger has retained BofA Securities to act as Ranger’s financial advisor in connection with the
company merger. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,

advisor in connection with the company merger on the basis of BofA Securities’ experience in transactions
similar to the company merger, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with Ranger and
its business.
On February 27, 2023, at a meeting of the Ranger board held to evaluate the company merger, BofA
Securities delivered to the Ranger board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated February 27, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to
various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by
holders of Ranger common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Baytex;
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business,
operations and prospects of Baytex furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the

In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided
to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and BofA Securities relied upon the
assurances of the management of Ranger and Baytex that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to
the Ranger Forecasts, BofA Securities was advised by Ranger, and assumed, that they were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the
management of Ranger as to the future financial performance of Ranger. With respect to the Baytex
Forecasts, the Synergies, the NOLs and the Step-Up, BofA Securities was advised by Baytex, and was
directed by Ranger to assume, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently

assumed, with the consent of Ranger, that the Baytex Forecasts, the Synergies, the NOLs and the Step-Up
will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected. BofA Securities relied, at the direction of Ranger,
upon the assessments of the management of Ranger as to the potential impact of market, governmental or

assets of Ranger or Baytex. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Ranger or Baytex
under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities
assumed, at the direction of Ranger, that the Opco Unit Exchange and the company merger would be
consummated in accordance with their terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material
term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and
other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Opco Unit Exchange and the company merger, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or

modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Ranger, Baytex or the contemplated
benefits of the Opco Unit Exchange or the company merger. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of
Ranger, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the Draft
Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the
company merger (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion),
including, without limitation, the form or structure of the company merger, the form or structure, or financial
or other terms, aspects or implications of any related transaction, or any terms, aspects or implications of any
voting or support agreements or any governance or other arrangements, agreements or understandings

Securities’ opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to
be received by holders of Ranger common stock and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any
consideration received in connection with the company merger by the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to
the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of

merits of the company merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to
Ranger or in which Ranger might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Ranger to proceed
with or effect the company merger. BofA Securities did not express any opinion as to what the value of
Baytex common shares actually would be when issued or the prices at which Ranger common stock or Baytex
common shares would trade at any time, including following announcement or consummation of the
company merger. BofA Securities did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and relied, with
Ranger’s consent, upon the assessments of Ranger and its representatives regarding legal, regulatory,
accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Ranger or the company merger (including the contemplated
benefits thereof), as to which matters BofA Securities understood that Ranger had obtained such advice as
Ranger deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or
recommendation as to how any shareholder should vote or act in connection with the company merger or

Summary of Material Financial Analyses
Ranger Financial Analyses.
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and
stock market information for Ranger and the following five publicly traded companies in the energy industry:

BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise value of the selected publicly traded
companies, calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on February 24, 2023, plus total debt,
issued and outstanding preferred stock and non-controlling interests, less cash and cash equivalents and
short-term and long-term liquid investments, as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 estimated adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization, referred to as EBITDA, as set forth in the
table above. Based on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a range of calendar
year 2023 EBITDA multiples of 2.3x to 3.3x to Ranger’s calendar year 2023 EBITDA of $832 million, to
determine implied per share equity values. Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded companies
were based on research analysts’ estimates available as of February 24, 2023, and estimated financial data of
Ranger were based on the Ranger Forecasts.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for
Ranger, as compared to the implied value of the merger consideration, calculated by adding the $13.31 cash
consideration to the implied value of the 7.49 Baytex common shares represented by the share consideration
based on the C$5.74 spot price of Baytex common shares on February 24, 2023 on the TSX, converted into
USD at the spot exchange rate of 0.753 (the “Implied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration”), and to the
Implied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration, discounted to December 31, 2022 at a discount rate of
11.7%, representing the middle point of the estimated range of Ranger’s weighted average cost of capital:

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Ranger. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the public trading or other values of any company to which Ranger was compared.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available,

one-year forward estimated EBITDA. Based on its professional judgement and experience, BofA Securities
then applied one-year forward EBITDA multiples of 2.5x to 3.5x derived from the selected transactions to
Ranger’s calendar year 2023 estimated EBITDA. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were
based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. Estimated
financial data of Ranger were based on the Ranger Forecasts. This analysis indicated the following
approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Ranger, as compared to the Implied Per Share
Value of the Merger Consideration, and to the Implied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration, discounted
to December 31, 2022 at a discount rate of 11.7%, representing the middle point of the estimated range of

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Ranger
or the company merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies,
business segments or transactions to which Ranger and the company merger were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a “life of asset” discounted cash flow
analysis of Ranger to estimate the present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that
Ranger’s assets were forecasted to generate during Ranger’s fiscal years 2023 through 2067 based on the
Ranger Forecasts. The cash flows were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using
discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 12.9%, which were based on an estimate of Ranger’s weighted average
cost of capital.
BofA Securities also estimated the per share impact of the pro forma tax savings due to the Synergies,
the incremental utilization of the NOLs and the Step-Up anticipated by the management of Baytex to result
from the Merger Transactions. BofA Securities applied discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 12.9% to such
tax savings to determine a range of present values for the additional tax shield, which BofA Securities
divided by the number of fully-diluted shares of Ranger common stock outstanding to calculate a range of
tax savings per share of Ranger common stock of $1.93 to $2.17 (the “Pro Forma Synergies and Tax
Savings”). BofA Securities then added the range of Pro Forma Synergies and Tax Savings to the range of
implied standalone per share equity values of Ranger common stock to compute a reference range of pro
forma implied per share equity values.
These analyses indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for
Ranger (i) without and (ii) including the Pro Forma Synergies and Tax Savings, as compared to the Implied
Per Share Value of Merger Consideration, and to the Implied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration,
discounted to December 31, 2022 at a discount rate of 11.7%, representing the middle point of the estimated

BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise values of the selected publicly traded
companies calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on February 24, 2023, plus total debt,
issued and outstanding preferred stock and non-controlling interests, less cash and cash equivalents and
short-term and long-term liquid investments, as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA, as set
forth in the table above. Based on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a range
of calendar year 2023 EBITDA multiples of 2.8x to 3.8x to Baytex’s calendar year 2023 EBITDA of CAD $1,271
million, as set forth in the Baytex Forecasts, to determine implied per share equity values.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for
Baytex as compared to the closing trading price of Baytex common shares on February 24, 2023, in each case,

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a “life of asset” discounted cash flow
analysis of Baytex to estimate the present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that
Baytex’s assets were forecasted to generate during Baytex’s fiscal years 2023 through 2050 based on the
Baytex Forecasts. The cash flows were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using
discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.4%, which were based on an estimate of Baytex’s weighted average
cost of capital.

Relative Financial Analyses.
Implied Exchange Ratio Analysis.
Utilizing the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for Ranger and Baytex described
above by dividing (i) the low endpoint and the high endpoint of the per share equity reference ranges
derived for Ranger pursuant to the analyses of selected publicly traded companies and discounted cash
flows (both with and without taking into account the potential financial effect of the Pro Forma Synergies
and Tax Savings, and subtracting the $13.31 cash consideration) by (ii) the high endpoint and the low
endpoint of the per share equity reference ranges derived for Baytex pursuant to the analyses of selected
publicly traded companies and discounted cash flows, respectively, BofA Securities calculated the following

Has/Gets Analysis.
BofA Securities performed a has/gets analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for the
holders of Ranger common stock resulting from the company merger based on (i) the pro forma ownership of
holders of Ranger common stock of Baytex after giving effect to the company merger and (ii) the 100%
ownership by holders of Ranger common stock of Ranger common stock on a standalone basis.
For Ranger on a stand-alone basis, BofA Securities used the reference range obtained in its discounted
cash flow analysis described above under “Summary of Material Financial Analyses - Ranger Financial
Analyses - Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.”
For Ranger on a pro forma basis, BofA Securities added the high to low reference range of standalone
implied equity values of Baytex obtained in its discounted cash flow analysis described above under
“Summary of Material Financial Analyses - Baytex Financial Analyses - Discounted Cash Flow Analysis”
and the present value of the Pro Forma Synergies and Tax Savings to the low to high reference ranges of
standalone implied equity values of Ranger, and subtracted the expected amount of incremental net debt
expected to be incurred by Baytex in connection with the company merger to calculate a range of implied pro
forma equity values, then divided the implied pro forma equity values by the estimated number of Baytex
common shares expected to be outstanding on a fully diluted basis following the company merger, to

consideration of 7.49 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock. BofA Securities then added
the cash consideration per share of Ranger common stock of $13.31 to derive a range of implied
consideration per share values for the Ranger common stock. The comparison yielded the following:

As noted above, the discussion set forth above is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
presented by BofA Securities to the Ranger board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive
description of all analyses undertaken or the factors considered by BofA Securities in connection with its
66 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must
be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the
factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses
and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been
referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than
any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and
economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Ranger or Baytex. The
estimates of the future performance of Ranger or Baytex in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were
prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration and were provided to the Ranger board in connection with the delivery of BofA
Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company
might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.
Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis
described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA
Securities’ view of the actual values of Ranger or Baytex.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the company merger was determined through
negotiations between Ranger and Baytex, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the
Ranger board. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Ranger board. As
described above, BofA Securities’ opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the
Ranger board in its evaluation of the proposed company merger and should not be viewed as determinative
of the views of the Ranger board or Ranger’s management with respect to the company merger or the merger
consideration.
Ranger has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the company merger an
aggregate fee currently estimated to be approximately $18 million, $2 million of which was payable upon the
delivery of its opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the
company merger. Ranger also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in
connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of
BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against
specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full-service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in
securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and
principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment
management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide
range of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA
Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that
invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in
equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other
obligations) of Ranger and certain of its affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future
may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Ranger and/or certain
of its affiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these
services, including (i) having acted as financial advisor to Penn Virginia Corporation (now Ranger) in
connection with the acquisition of Lonestar Resources US Inc., (ii) having acted as manager for a certain
debt offering of a Ranger subsidiary, (iii) having acted or acting as co-lead arranger, joint bookrunner for,
and/or lender under, certain revolving credit, letters of credit or other facilities of Ranger and/or certain of its
affiliates, (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury management services and products to Ranger

Ranger’s management does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance,
revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and
subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. Ranger is especially reluctant to disclose
projections for extended periods due to the increasing uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of such
assumptions and estimates when applied to time periods further in the future. As a result, Ranger does not
endorse projections or other unaudited prospective financial information as a reliable indication of future
results. However, in connection with the Ranger board’s evaluation of a potential transaction, Ranger’s
management independently prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2023
through 2027 and a cumulative presentation of estimates for the years 2028 through 2067 for Ranger (the
“Ranger projections for Ranger”). Ranger’s management also considered certain unaudited prospective
financial information for Baytex for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 and a cumulative presentation of estimates
for the years 2028 through 2050 prepared by the management of Baytex, but assuming current strip pricing
for commodity pricing (rather than flat pricing as assumed by the management of Baytex) (the “Baytex
projections with Ranger assumptions” and together with the Ranger projections for Ranger, the “Ranger
projections”). The Ranger projections were made available to the Ranger board in connection with its
consideration and evaluation of the Merger Transactions and were provided to BofA Securities in
connection with its financial analyses and opinion.
Ranger is including a summary of the Ranger projections in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to
provide Ranger shareholders with access to the final projections prepared by Ranger’s management that
were made available to the Ranger board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Transactions and
made available to BofA Securities, and which BofA Securities was instructed by the Ranger board to use, in
connection with its financial analyses and opinion.
The inclusion of the Ranger projections in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as
an indication that any of Ranger or any of its affiliates, advisors or representatives have considered the
Ranger projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the Ranger projections should not be relied
upon as such. Ranger advises the recipients of the Ranger projections that its internal financial forecasts
upon which the Ranger projections were based are subjective in many respects.
Although presented with numerical specificity, the Ranger projections were based on numerous
variables, assumptions and estimates as to future events made by Ranger’s management that Ranger’s
management believed were reasonable at the time the Ranger projections were prepared, taking into account
the relevant information available to management at the time. These variables, assumptions and estimates are
inherently uncertain and many are beyond the control of Ranger. Important factors that may affect actual
results and cause these internal financial Ranger projections to not be achieved include, but are not limited
to, risks and uncertainties relating to the business of Ranger (including its ability to achieve strategic goals,
objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, the regulatory and competitive
environment, changes in technology, general business and economic conditions and other risk factors
referenced in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 39. Various assumptions underlying the Ranger
projections may not prove to have been, or may no longer be, accurate. The Ranger projections may not be
realized, and actual results may be significantly higher or lower than projected in the Ranger projections. The
Ranger projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business strategies or plans that are subject to
change. The Ranger projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the
date they were prepared. The Ranger projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature
becomes less predictive with each successive year. As a result, the inclusion of the Ranger projections in
this proxy statement/prospectus should not be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events.
For all of these reasons, the internal financial Ranger projections, and the assumptions upon which they are
based, (i) are not guarantees of future results; (ii) are inherently speculative; and (iii) are subject to a number
of risks
68 TABLE OF CONTENTS
and uncertainties. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in these internal
financial Ranger projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Ranger projections will be
realized.
The Ranger projections were prepared solely for internal use and to assist the Ranger board with its
consideration and evaluation of the Merger Transactions and BofA Securities with its financial analyses and
opinion, and although the Ranger projections were prepared on an accounting basis consistent with
Ranger’s financial statements, they were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward
compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The
Ranger projections included in this proxy statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the
responsibility of, Ranger. Neither Ranger’s independent auditor nor any other independent accountant has
compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Ranger projections, nor have they
expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.
Unlevered free cash flow contained in the Ranger projections is a “non-GAAP financial measure,” which
is a financial performance measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measure used in the Ranger projections was relied upon by BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion and
by the Ranger board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Transactions. The SEC rules which
would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do
not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business
combination such as the Merger Transactions if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by
BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion or by the Ranger board in connection with its evaluation of the
Merger Transactions. Accordingly, Ranger has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures
included in the Ranger projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in
compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Ranger may not be comparable to
similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP
financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP
presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not
as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
For these reasons, as well as the basis and assumptions on which the Ranger projections were
compiled, the inclusion of specific portions of the Ranger projections in this proxy statement/prospectus
should not be regarded as an indication that such Ranger projections will be an accurate prediction of future
events, and they should not be relied on as such. None of Ranger or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers,
directors, partners or representatives (including BofA Securities) can give you any assurance that actual
results will not differ from these Ranger projections. Except as required by applicable law, none of Ranger or
any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including BofA Securities)
undertake any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Ranger projections or the specific
portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Ranger projections were generated or
to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to
be in error. Therefore, readers of this proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue, if any,
reliance on the specific portions of the Ranger projections set forth below. None of Ranger or any of its
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including BofA Securities) intend to make
publicly available any update or other revision to these Ranger projections. In addition, none of Ranger or
any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including BofA Securities) have
made, make, or are authorized in the future to make, any representation to any shareholder or other person
regarding Ranger’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Ranger projections or
that projected results will be achieved, and any statements to the contrary should be disregarded. Ranger
has made no representation to Baytex, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Ranger
projections.
In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Ranger special meeting will be held several months
after the unaudited prospective financial information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in
any forecasted information, Ranger shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such
information, and Ranger urges you to review Ranger’s and Baytex’s most recent SEC filings for a description

of Ranger’s and Baytex’s reported financial results included therein. See the section entitled “Where You Can

The actual number of incentive awards (“IA”), share settled restricted awards (“RA (SS)”), performance
awards (“PA”) and share settled performance awards (“PA (SS)”) granted to the executive officers was, in
each case, determined by dividing the dollar amount of the grants shown above by the volume weighted
average trading price of the Baytex common shares on the TSX for the five trading days preceding the grant
date. The grant date fair value of one Baytex common share underlying the share-based awards was C$7.34

grant date fair value of one Baytex common share underlying the share-based awards was C$5.68 on March

Julia Gwaltney, Jeffrey E. Wojahn and Tiffany Thom Cepak have been omitted from the table because
while Ms. Gwaltney, Mr. Wojahn and Ms. Cepak are expected to be either an executive officer or director
of Baytex immediately following the closing, they did not own any Baytex common shares or Baytex
share-based awards as of March 31, 2023.
DSUs may be cash-settled or, at the election of the Baytex board, share-settled.
The total number of Baytex common shares held by each executive officer does not include the IAs. IAs
are cash-settled only and no director holds IAs.
M. Scott Lovett has resigned from his position as a Baytex executive officer, to be effective on May 19,
2023.
Description of Share-Based Awards
Each PA (SS) has three vesting periods equal to one-third of the total grant. On vesting in the first year
following the grant, the number of shares issued is determined by multiplying the number of shares
underlying the portion of the PA (SS) vesting by the payout multiplier for the most recently ended year. On
vesting in the second year following the grant, the number of shares issued is determined by multiplying the
number of shares underlying the portion of the PA (SS) vesting by the average of the payout multipliers for
the two most recently ended years. On vesting in the third year following the grant, the number of shares
issued is determined by multiplying the number of shares underlying the portion of the PA (SS) vesting by
the average of the payout multipliers for the three most recently completed years.
Each RA (SS) entitles the holder to be issued the number of common shares designated in the RA (SS)
with such Baytex common shares to be issued on dates determined by the HRC Committee. The issue dates
are typically one third on each of the first, second, and third anniversary of the grant date.
Each share-based award is adjusted at settlement to account for the payment of dividends (if any) from
the grant date to the applicable settlement date.
Other than the available method of settlement, generally, PAs are the same as PA (SS)s and IAs are the
same as RA (SS)s. Baytex has the option to settle PAs in cash or shares. If settled in cash, the payment is
determined based on the five day volume weighted average price for Baytex’s common shares.

In addition, in October of 2022, the HRC Committee approved an on-hire grant of PA (SS)s and RA (SS)s
to Mr. Greager. The awards vest one-third in March 2024, one-third in March 2025 and one-third in March
2026. To accommodate a vesting period of longer than three calendar years and applicable tax laws, the
Board approved an amendment to Baytex’s share award incentive plan to allow the granting of awards that
are to be settled in shares, instead of cash or shares at Baytex’s option. It was also the intention of the HRC
Committee to increase Mr. Greager’s share ownership in Baytex with these share-settled awards.

In considering the recommendations of the Ranger board, Ranger shareholders should be aware that
Ranger’s directors and executive officers have interests in the company merger that may be different from, or
in addition to, the interests of other Ranger shareholders generally. The Ranger board was aware of and
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the company
merger, in adopting the Merger Agreement and in recommending that Ranger shareholders vote “FOR” the
Ranger Merger Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following discussion sets forth certain of these interests in the company merger for each director
and executive officer of Ranger. For purposes of this disclosure, the executive officers and directors of
Ranger are as follows:
Darrin J. Henke - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director;
Russell T Kelley, Jr. - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer;
Julia Gwaltney - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer;
Edward Geiser - Chairman of the Board;
Richard Burnett - Director;
Tiffany Thom Cepak - Director;
Garrett Chunn - Director;
Kevin Cumming - Director;
Timothy Gray - Director;
Joshua Schmidt - Director; and
Jeffrey E. Wojahn - Director.
Each of Edward Geiser, Garrett Chunn, Kevin Cumming, Joshua Schmidt, and Timothy Gray were
appointed to the Ranger board by the Class B Holders. Mr. Geiser has shared voting and investment power
over the shares held by the Class B Holders.
Ranger Directors to Be Appointed to the Baytex Board
Pursuant to the IRRA, Baytex has agreed to take appropriate actions to cause to be elected or appointed
as a director of the combined company the Ranger Designees, or, in the event a Ranger Designee is unwilling
or unable to serve as a member of the Baytex board at the time of such appointment, then another member or
members of the Ranger board that is determined by the Nominating Committee of the Baytex board to be
independent with respect to his or her service on the Baytex board will be appointed to the Baytex board to
fill such vacancy or vacancies on the Baytex board in lieu of Mr. Wojahn and/or the other Ranger Designee,
as applicable. Any remuneration to be paid to these directors will be consistent with Baytex’s remuneration
policy for its directors. The Baytex board is currently comprised of nine directors, and it is expected that
eight of these directors will continue to serve on the Baytex board following completion of the Merger
Transactions. One of the current Baytex directors has stated that he will not stand for re-election at the
Baytex annual and special meeting.
Treatment of Ranger Equity-Based Awards
Each Ranger TRSU award, other than any Ranger Director TRSU award, and each Ranger PBRSU award,
in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be converted into
Converted Baytex TRSU awards at the closing, with the number of Baytex common shares subject to the
Converted Baytex TRSU awards equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ranger common stock
subject to such Ranger TRSU award or Ranger PBRSU award (at the maximum level of performance), as
applicable, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the cash consideration divided by the volume weighted average
price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to
the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (y) the share consideration, rounded up to the nearest
whole Baytex common share. Converted Baytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger TRSU awards will remain
subject to the same vesting schedule and Converted Baytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger PBRSU
awards will be converted based on the number of shares payable upon maximum performance and will remain
subject to the same time-vesting schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon an involuntary termination of the holder’s employment or service
by Baytex, Ranger or any of their subsidiaries without “cause”  (as defined in the Ranger Equity Plan) or a
resignation by the holder for “good reason”  (to the extent provided and as defined in the applicable
80 
(1) 
(2) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
award agreement), in each case, that occurs on or within 12 months following the merger effective time, such
awards will immediately vest in full as of such termination date.
Any dividend equivalents that have been accrued with respect to Ranger equity awards will become
payable ratably if and when such underlying Converted Baytex TRSU award vests.
Each Ranger Director TRSU award will vest in full at the merger effective time and be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, without interest, the merger consideration with respect to each share of
Ranger common stock subject to such Ranger Director TRSU award plus the amount of any dividend
equivalents payable with respect to such Ranger Director TRSU award that remain unpaid as of the merger
effective time. No fractional Baytex common share will be issued in respect of a Ranger Director TRSU award,
and any such fractional Baytex common share will instead be paid in cash.
The table below sets forth, for each Ranger executive officer, the aggregate number of shares of Ranger
common stock subject to outstanding Ranger PBRSU awards and Ranger TRSU awards held by such
executive officer assuming (i) as required under SEC rules, the closing price of a share of Ranger common
stock is $42.94 (the “Estimated Closing Value”), which is equal to the average closing price of a share of
Ranger common stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the entry
into the Merger Agreement, (ii) a closing date of May 8, 2023 (which is the assumed date of closing solely for
purpose of the disclosure in this section), and (iii) payout at maximum level of performance for each Ranger
PBRSU award. The actual value realized with respect to any Ranger PBRSU awards and Ranger TRSU awards
cannot be determined with any certainty until the awards are settled.

Executive Officer Severance Arrangements
Each executive officer participates in Ranger’s Executive Severance Plan (the “Executive Severance
Plan”). The Executive Severance Plan provides each executive officer with certain severance benefits upon
certain terminations of employment that are enhanced following a “change in control”. If a “change in
control”  (including the company merger) occurs and within 24 months after such “change in control” event
the executive officer’s employment is terminated by Ranger without Cause (other than due to the executive
officer’s death or disability) or the executive officer resigns with Good Reason (each as defined in the
Executive Severance Plan), the executive officer is eligible to receive the following payments and benefits:
a lump sum cash payment equal to 2.0 times (or 2.5 in the case of Mr. Henke) the sum of the
executive’s base salary and target annual bonus amount;
an additional pro-rata (based on the number of whole months worked during the year) annual bonus
for the year of termination (based on the actual level of performance, with any subjective or
discretionary components of such annual bonus deemed achieved at the target level), payable in a
lump sum at the same time annual bonuses are paid to other Ranger management employees;
Ranger-provided outplacement services up to a maximum cost of $10,000; and
up to 18 months’ employer-subsidized COBRA premiums for continued group health benefits for the
executive and his or her eligible dependents.
Benefits under the Executive Severance Plan are conditioned upon the executive officer’s execution of a
release of claims that includes customary confidentiality, non-disparagement, non-competition and non-
solicitation provisions.
“Cause,” as defined in the Executive Severance Plan, means any one or more of the following: the
executive’s (i) willful and continued failure to substantially perform the executive’s duties with Ranger or any
affiliate (other than any such failure resulting from the executive’s Disability, as that term is defined in the
Executive Severance Plan); (ii) conviction of a felony; (iii) willful engagement in gross misconduct materially
and demonstrably injurious to Ranger or any affiliate; (iv) commission of one or more significant acts of
dishonesty as regards Ranger or any affiliate; or (v) willful failure to comply with any material policies or
procedures of Ranger as in effect from time to time.
“Good Reason,” as defined in the Executive Severance Plan, means the occurrence of any of the
following events or conditions without the consent of the executive: (i) a material reduction in the
executive’s base salary or annual cash incentive compensation opportunity; (ii) the relocation of the
executive to a location more than 50 miles from Houston, Texas or the location at which the executive was
previously based and which increases the executive’s commute by 50 miles or more; or (iii) a material
diminution in the executive’s title, authority, duties or responsibilities; provided, however, that Good Reason
shall not have occurred unless (x) such event or condition remains uncured 45 days following the executive’s
delivery to Ranger of written notice of the specific grounds for Good Reason (the “Cure Period”), (y) such
written notice is delivered within 45 days following the initial occurrence of the event or condition giving
rise to Good Reason, and (z) the executive terminates his or her employment with Ranger within 10 days after
the expiration of the Cure Period.
The company merger will constitute a “change in control” under the Executive Severance Plan. For the
quantification of the estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be
payable to Ranger’s executive officers, see the table below under “- Interests of Ranger’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Ranger’s Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Company Merger.”
The Executive Severance Plan includes a “best net” provision providing that the executive officer’s
payments and benefits will be either capped at the safe harbor amount to avoid the imposition of excise taxes
under Code Section 4999 or paid in full subjecting them to possible excise tax liability, whichever
82 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
provides the better after-tax benefit to the executive. None of the executive officers is entitled to a Code
Section 4999 gross-up in connection with the company merger.
Additionally, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon an involuntary termination of the executive
officer’s employment or service by Baytex, Ranger or any of their subsidiaries without “Cause”  (as defined in
the Ranger Equity Plan), which occurs on or within 12 months following the closing (a “Qualifying
Termination”), subject to the executive officer’s execution of a general release of claims against Baytex and
its affiliates and compliance with any applicable restrictive covenants, the executive officer will be entitled to
an amount in cash equal to the executive officer’s 2023 long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) target, (i) prorated
for the number of days that have elapsed since January 1, 2023 for the Ranger PBRSU awards through the
date of such Qualifying Termination and (ii) minus the value of any LTIP award granted to the executive
officer by Baytex (or its applicable subsidiary) that (x) has vested in connection with or prior to such
Qualifying Termination or (y) is otherwise not forfeited upon such Qualifying Termination (with such value,
in each case, determined based on the Fair Market Value (as defined in Baytex’s share award incentive plan)
of the applicable portion of the LTIP award as of such vesting date (in the case of (x)) or the Qualifying
Termination date (in the case of (y))) (such amount described in this paragraph, the “2023 LTI Payment”).
Retention Bonuses
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each executive officer (i) received, on the regularly-scheduled
payment date for annual bonuses under Ranger’s short-term cash incentive plan for the 2022 calendar year
(the “2022 Bonus Plan”) an amount equal to (x) 50% times (y) 135% of the executive officer’s target 2022
annual bonus (such amount, the “2022 Bonus Payment”) and (ii) will be eligible to receive a retention bonus
payment equal to the 2022 Bonus Payment within five business days following the closing, provided that
such executive officer either (a) remains employed with Baytex following the closing or (b) undergoes an
involuntary termination of the executive officer’s employment on the closing date by Ranger or its affiliates
without “cause”  (as defined in the Ranger Equity Plan) at the direction of Baytex (the payment described in
this clause (ii), the “Retention Bonus”).
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Ranger’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Company Merger
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the
compensation of each of the Ranger named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
company merger that Ranger’s named executive officers could receive in connection with the company
merger, as described more fully above under “- Interests of Ranger’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.” Such amounts have been calculated assuming (i) a closing date of May 8, 2023, which is the
assumed date of closing of the company merger solely for purposes of the disclosures in this section, (ii) a
price equal to the Estimated Closing Value, (iii) vesting of the Ranger PBRSU awards based on maximum
performance (i.e., payout at 200% of the number of shares covered by such awards), (iv) each named
executive officer is terminated by Baytex, Ranger, and their applicable subsidiaries without “cause”  (other
than due to the named executive officer’s death or disability) at or immediately following the merger effective
time and (v) each of Ranger’s named executive officers has properly executed any required releases and
complied with all requirements (including any applicable restrictive covenants) necessary in order to receive
such payments and benefits. Some of the assumptions used in the table below are based upon information
not currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts to be received by any of Ranger’s named
executive officers, if any, may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. The amounts in the table
below do not reflect any reduction in payments that may be applicable pursuant to the “best net” provision
described above.
The payments described in the table below are made pursuant to the arrangements described above in
the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Ranger’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Amounts shown reflect the Retention Bonus, severance payments provided under the Executive
Severance Plan and the 2023 LTI Payment each as described above in the section entitled “- Executive
Officer Severance Arrangements.” The severance benefits and the 2023 LTI Payment, are considered to
be “double-trigger” payments, which means that both the closing and a qualifying termination of
employment must occur prior to any payment being provided to the Ranger named executive officer. As
described above in the section entitled “- Executive Officer Severance Arrangements,” the severance
payments of each named executive officer (other than Mr. Mathis) will consist of (i) a lump sum cash
payment equal to 2.0 times (or 2.5 for Mr. Henke) the sum of the executive’s base salary and target
annual bonus amount; (ii) a pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination; and (iii) an amount in
cash equal to the 2023 LTI Payment. The Retention Bonuses are considered to be “single-trigger”
payments, which means that only the closing must occur prior to the named executive officer becoming
eligible to receive such payment. The estimated amount of each such payment included in the Cash
column above is set forth in the table below:

Mr. Mathis separated from Ranger effective January 4, 2021. He is included as a named executive officer
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K but is not receiving any payments pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or in connection with the Merger Transactions contemplated thereby.
Share Ownership
As described under “The Merger - Merger Consideration”, executive officers and non-employee
directors of Ranger beneficially own shares of Ranger common stock, and will be entitled to receive the
merger consideration in respect of each share of Ranger Class A common stock beneficially owned by them.
Indemnification and Insurance
Baytex and the surviving corporation have agreed, until the six-year anniversary of the merger effective
time to, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, in the same manner as provided by
Ranger immediately prior to February 27, 2023, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
February 27, 2023 or who becomes, prior to the merger effective time, an officer or director of Ranger or any
of its subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any employee benefit plan or is or was serving at the
request of Ranger or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, in each
case, when acting in such capacity (whom are referred to herein as the “indemnified persons”) against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees
and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or incurred in connection
with, any actual or threatened proceeding to which such indemnified person is a party or is otherwise
involved (including as a witness) based on, in whole or in part, or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact
that such person is or was an officer or director of Ranger or any of its subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any
employee benefit plan sponsored, maintained, or contributed to by Ranger or is or was serving at the request
of Ranger or any of its subsidiaries as an officer, director, employee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, as
applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by such person in any such capacity, whether
pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to or at, but not after, the merger effective time
and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the merger effective time (which liabilities are referred to
herein as “indemnified liabilities”), including all indemnified liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the Merger Agreement or the Merger Transactions, in each case to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and Baytex and the surviving corporation will, jointly and
severally, pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final disposition of any such
proceeding to each indemnified person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law).
Until the six-year anniversary date of the merger effective time, neither Baytex nor the surviving
corporation will amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the organizational documents of the
surviving corporation or its subsidiaries in any manner that would affect adversely the rights of any
indemnified person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
applicable law. Baytex and the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will fulfill and honor any
indemnification, expense advancement, or exculpation agreements between Ranger or any of its subsidiaries
and any of their respective officers or directors existing and in effect immediately prior to the merger effective
time.
Baytex and the surviving corporation will cause to be put in place, and Baytex will fully prepay
immediately prior to the merger effective time, “tail” insurance policies with a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six years from the merger effective time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as Ranger’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in
an amount and scope at least as favorable as Ranger’s existing policies subject to a premium cap, with
respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at, prior to, or after the merger effective time.

Ranger Oil Corp_20230518_DEFM14A_20894462_4669228.Pdf,The Baytex Annual and Special Meeting and Shareholder Approval,"The Baytex Annual and Special Meeting and Shareholder Approval
Under Section 611 of the TSX Company Manual, security holder approval is required if the number of
securities issued or issuable by a listed issuer in payment of the purchase price for an acquisition, exceeds
25% of the number of securities of the listed issuer which are outstanding, on a pre-acquisition non-diluted
basis. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Baytex has agreed to issue 7.49 Baytex common shares in
exchange for each eligible share and $13.31 in cash, without interest and to convert each Ranger TRSU
award, other than Ranger Director TRSU awards, and each Ranger PBRSU award, in each case, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time, into Converted Baytex TRSU awards (as further
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Ranger Equity Awards” on page
123). Accordingly, if the company merger is completed, Baytex anticipates that up to 323,323,741 Baytex
common shares would be issued or issuable as partial payment of the purchase price for the company
merger, representing approximately 37% of the then-current issued and outstanding Baytex common shares,
including for these purposes, the shares underlying the Converted Baytex TRSU awards.
Because the number of Baytex common shares being issued in the Merger Transactions will exceed 25%
of the number of outstanding Baytex common shares on a pre-acquisition, non-diluted basis, Baytex
shareholders will be required pursuant to Section 611 of the TSX Company Manual to approve the issuance
of such number of Baytex common shares as is necessary under the Merger Agreement, and Baytex will not
be able to satisfy the listing requirements of the TSX unless the Baytex share issuance resolution is
approved.
The actual number of Baytex common shares to be issued or reserved for issuance under the Merger
Agreement will be determined immediately prior to the merger effective time based on the share
consideration, the number of shares of Ranger Class A common stock outstanding at such time and the
number of Ranger equity awards outstanding at such time.
Baytex held the Baytex annual and special meeting on May 15, 2023 where Baytex shareholders
considered and approved, among other matters, the Baytex share issuance resolution. Baytex has separately
prepared and delivered the management information circular to Baytex shareholders in connection with the
Baytex annual and special meeting in accordance with applicable Canadian securities, TSX and corporate
laws.",117,117

In accordance with IFRS, Baytex will account for the Merger Transactions using the acquisition method
of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the total purchase consideration paid by Baytex in
connection with the Merger Transactions will be allocated to Ranger’s identifiable assets and liabilities
based on their fair values as of the closing of the Merger Transactions. Any excess of the total purchase
consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Ranger at
their respective fair value would be recorded as goodwill. Conversely, any excess of the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Ranger at their respective fair values over the total
purchase consideration would be recorded as a gain on acquisition. Ranger’s operating results will be
included in Baytex’s consolidated results of operations only for periods subsequent to the closing of the
Merger Transactions.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented in this proxy
statement/prospectus has been derived from the audited historical financial statements of Baytex and Ranger
as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2022 and from the unaudited interim financial statements of
Baytex and Ranger as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023 presents the financial position of Baytex

Each of Ranger and Baytex filed a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act

Commission (“FTC”). On April 12, 2023, the waiting period under the HSR Act expired. The expiration of the
HSR waiting period satisfies one of the conditions of the Merger. The expiration or early termination of any
HSR Act waiting period does not preclude the Antitrust Division or the FTC from challenging the company
merger on antitrust grounds or from seeking to preliminarily or permanently enjoin the proposed merger. If
the company merger is not completed within 12 months after the expiration or early termination of the
applicable HSR Act waiting period, Ranger and Baytex will be required to submit a new Pre-Merger
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act to the Antitrust Division and the FTC, and a new HSR
Act waiting period will have to expire or be terminated early before the company merger could be completed.

Upon completion of the company merger, each eligible share will be converted into the right to receive
7.49 Baytex common shares (and the cash consideration).
Prior to the merger effective time, Baytex and Ranger will mutually agree and will appoint, an exchange
agent to handle the exchange of shares of Ranger Class A common stock for merger consideration. Prior to
the merger effective time, Baytex will deposit or cause to be deposited with the exchange agent for the
benefit of holders of eligible shares, the merger consideration in respect of eligible shares. In addition,
Baytex will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the exchange agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any Post-Effective Time Dividends and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares.
Ranger shareholders will not receive any fractional Baytex common shares in the company merger.
Instead, a shareholder of Ranger who otherwise would have received a fractional Baytex common share will
be entitled to receive, from the exchange agent appointed pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a cash
payment without interest, in lieu of such fractional share equal to the fractional share interest to which such
shareholder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Ranger Class A common
stock exchanged by such shareholder).
No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for eligible shares. Baytex, Ranger, merger
sub, the exchange agent, each of their respective affiliates and any other applicable withholding agent will be
entitled to deduct or withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any person pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or the Opco Unit Exchange any amount required to be deducted or withheld under applicable law
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any deduction or withholding is required in respect of the
delivery of any Baytex common shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the applicable withholding agent
may withhold or deduct from the cash consideration and/or a portion of the share consideration otherwise
deliverable pursuant to the Merger Agreement). If any portion of the merger consideration deposited with
the exchange agent is not claimed within 180 days following the closing date, such merger consideration will
be delivered to Baytex or the surviving corporation, upon demand, and any former Ranger Class A
shareholders who have not theretofore received the merger consideration, cash-in-lieu of fractional shares or
Post-Effective Time Dividends, will thereafter look only to the surviving corporation and Baytex for payment
of their claim for such amounts.
Certificates
As soon as practicable after the merger effective time, Baytex will cause the exchange agent to deliver to
each record holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the merger effective
time represented eligible shares, a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the company merger
and a letter of transmittal, and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates for payment of
the merger consideration.
Upon surrender to the exchange agent of a certificate, together with the letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the exchange agent, the holder of such certificate will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) one or more Baytex common shares (which will be in uncertificated
book entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Baytex common shares, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive (after taking into account all shares of Ranger Class A common stock
then held by such holder) and (ii) a check in the amount equal to the applicable aggregate cash
consideration, the cash payable in lieu of any fractional Baytex common shares and Post-Effective Time

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations (i) for U.S.
holders and non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) of Ranger Class A common stock, as of immediately
prior to the Merger Transactions, with respect to the exchange of such Ranger Class A common stock for
cash and Baytex common shares in the company merger and (ii) for U.S. holders of Baytex common shares
received in the company merger, as of immediately following the merger effective time, with respect to the
ownership and disposition of such Baytex common shares. This discussion does not address any tax
treatment of any other transactions occurring in connection with the company merger, including, but not
limited to, the Opco Unit Exchange. The following discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, U.S.
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial interpretations thereof and published rulings and
other positions of the IRS, each as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could
significantly affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. The U.S. federal income
tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. Neither Baytex nor Ranger has sought, or intends
to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the positions or conclusions
described in the following summary, and there can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary
position. To the extent this discussion contains statements regarding the beliefs, intentions, or expectations
of Baytex, Ranger, or the combined company, such statements do not constitute the opinion of Vinson &
Elkins LLP or any other tax advisor.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders that hold their Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex
common shares, as applicable, as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment). This discussion is not a complete description of all of the U.S. federal income
tax considerations related to the Merger Transactions or the ownership and disposition of Baytex common
shares, nor does it describe any tax consequences of the Merger Transactions or the ownership and
disposition of Baytex common shares arising under any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any
U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax law. Further, this discussion does not address all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder in light of its individual
circumstances (including the impact of the Medicare surtax on certain net investment income) or that may be
relevant to certain categories of holders that may be subject to special rules, such as:

U.S. Holder and Non-U.S. Holder Defined
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of (i) Ranger Class A common
stock prior to the merger effective time or (ii) Baytex common shares after the merger effective time, that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not a partnership and is any of the following:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

TABLE OF CONTENTS
a trust (i) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which
has one or more “United States persons”  (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) who
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has made a valid election
under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Ranger Class A common stock prior to the merger effective
time that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not a partnership and is an individual, corporation, estate
or trust, in each case that is not a U.S. holder.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in
such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner or the partnership, upon the activities
of the partnership and the partner, and upon certain determinations made at the partnership or partner level.
Accordingly, partners in partnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) holding Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares should
consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income and other tax
consequences to them of the company merger and of the ownership and disposition of Baytex common
shares.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Company Merger
U.S. Holders
The exchange by a U.S. holder of shares of Ranger Class A common stock for cash and Baytex common
shares in the company merger is expected to be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If such treatment applies, a U.S. holder who receives cash and Baytex common shares in exchange
for shares of Ranger Class A common stock in the company merger generally will recognize capital gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of
Baytex common shares received by such U.S. holder and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
shares of Ranger Class A common stock exchanged therefor. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Ranger
Class A common stock generally will equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for such Ranger Class A
common stock, as adjusted for certain corporate actions. The adjusted tax basis of each Baytex common
share received in the company merger will initially equal the fair market value of such share at the merger
effective time. Gain or loss must be calculated separately for each block of Ranger Class A common stock
exchanged by such U.S. holder if such blocks were acquired at different times or for different prices. Any
gain or loss so recognized generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period
in a particular block of Ranger Class A common stock is more than one year as of the merger effective time.
Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S.
federal income tax at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. U.S. holders
who acquired different blocks of Ranger Class A common stock at different times or for different prices
should consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to
them.
Non-U.S. Holders
The exchange by a non-U.S. holder of shares of Ranger Class A common stock for cash and Baytex
common shares in the company merger is expected to be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding in the section entitled “The Merger - 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Information Reporting and Backup Withholding”
below, any gain realized by a non-U.S. holder pursuant to the company merger generally would not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such non-U.S. holder in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment or fixed base maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case,
such gain generally would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.
persons, and, if the non-U.S. holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch
profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
92 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the company merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case,
such gain would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such
non-U.S. holder; or
shares of Ranger Class A common stock constitute United States real property interests by reason of
Ranger’s status as a United States real property holding corporation, as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code (a “USRPHC”) and, as a result, such gain is treated as effectively
connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States.
A non-U.S. holder whose gain is described in the third bullet point above, subject to the discussion
below, generally will be taxed on a net income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to
United States persons. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its United States real
property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property
interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, “U.S. real
property interests” generally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Ranger believes
that it currently is, and expects to remain, a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,
provided that the Ranger Class A common stock continues to be “regularly traded on an established
securities market” (within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury Regulations) as of the merger effective time, only
a non-U.S. holder that actually or constructively owns, or owned at any time during the shorter of the five-
year period ending on the date of the company merger or the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for its Ranger
Class A common stock, more than 5% of the Ranger Class A common stock will be treated as disposing of a
United States real property interest and will be taxable on gain realized on the disposition of the Ranger
Class A common stock as a result of Ranger’s status as a USRPHC. If the Ranger Class A common stock were
not considered to be regularly traded on an established securities market, each non-U.S. holder (regardless
of the percentage of stock owned) would be treated as disposing of a United States real property interest
and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the disposition of the Ranger Class A common stock
pursuant to the company merger (in the manner described above), and a 15% withholding tax would apply to
the gross proceeds from such disposition. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon,
their own tax advisors to determine the consequences of the company merger to them in light of their
particular circumstances and Ranger’s status as a USRPHC.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the Ownership and Disposition of Baytex
Common Shares
Tax Residence of Baytex for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes
A corporation is generally considered, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to be a tax resident in the
jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Accordingly, under the generally applicable U.S. federal
income tax rules, Baytex, which is organized under the laws of Canada, would be treated as a non-U.S.
corporation (and, therefore, not a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Section 7874 of the
Code provides an exception to this general rule, under which a non-U.S. organized entity might, in certain
circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These rules are complex
and guidance regarding their application is unclear and incomplete.
As relevant to Baytex after the consummation of the company merger, under Section 7874 of the Code,
an entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and organized outside the
United States (i.e., a non-U.S. corporation) will nevertheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and, therefore, as an inverted corporation if the following conditions are met: (i) the
non-U.S. corporation, directly or indirectly, acquires substantially all of the properties held directly or
indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including through the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of the
U.S. corporation), and (ii) after the acquisition, the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold
at least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation by reason of
holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation (taking into account the receipt of the non-U.S. corporation’s
shares in exchange for the U.S. corporation’s shares) as determined for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code
(the “80% Ownership Test”), unless, however, (iii) the non-U.S. corporation’s “expanded
93 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
affiliated group” has “substantial business activities” in the non-U.S. corporation’s country of organization
or incorporation (and tax residence) relative to the expanded affiliated group’s worldwide activities (the
“Substantial Business Activities Exception”). For purposes of computing the ownership percentage relevant
to the 80% Ownership Test, the U.S. Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code
require certain adjustments to the number of shares held by former shareholders of the acquired U.S.
corporation and to the total number of outstanding shares of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation, such that
the ownership percentage for purposes of the 80% Ownership Test may be higher than the percentage of
outstanding shares of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation actually held by former shareholders of the
acquired U.S. corporation.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Baytex will acquire all of the outstanding Ranger Class A common
stock. As a result, the determination of whether Baytex will be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes will depend on whether Baytex satisfies the 80% Ownership Test and, if it does, whether
it satisfies the Substantial Business Activities Exception. If the former holders of Ranger common stock hold
less than 80% (by both vote and value) of the Baytex common shares following the company merger (as
determined by taking into account the complex adjustments to the ownership percentage required under
Section 7874 of the Code), the 80% Ownership Test will not be satisfied, and Baytex will not be treated as
U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, regardless of whether the Substantial Business
Activities Exception is satisfied. In order for Baytex to satisfy the Substantial Business Activities Exception,
at least 25% of the employees (by headcount and compensation), real and tangible assets, and gross income
of Baytex’s expanded affiliated group must be based, located, and derived, respectively, in the country in
which Baytex is a tax resident after the consummation of the company merger (i.e., Canada).
If Baytex were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, this could result
in negative tax consequences for Baytex and holders of Baytex common shares. For example, Baytex would
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its worldwide income and, as a result, could be subject to substantial
liabilities for additional U.S. federal income taxes and any share repurchases made by Baytex may be subject
to the 1% non-deductible excise tax enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Moreover, the
gross amount of any dividend payments to Baytex’s non-U.S. holders could be subject to 30% U.S.
withholding tax (depending on the application of any income tax treaty that might apply to reduce the
withholding tax), and the ability of Baytex’s U.S. holders to credit any Canadian taxes imposed on them may
be materially limited. Holders should consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisors regarding the
application of the rules described above and any resultant tax consequences.
Even if a non-U.S. acquiring corporation did not meet the 80% Ownership Test and were not an inverted
corporation, other adverse consequences could apply if the non-U.S. acquiring corporation were
nonetheless a surrogate foreign corporation. A non-U.S. acquiring corporation is a surrogate foreign
corporation if it would meet the three requirements of Section 7874 of the Code to be treated as an inverted
corporation if the 80% Ownership Test threshold were reduced to 60% (the “60% Ownership Test”).
If the non-U.S. acquiring corporation were a surrogate foreign corporation, the taxable income of the
acquired U.S. corporation (and any U.S. person considered to be related to the acquired U.S. corporation
pursuant to applicable rules) for any given year, within a period beginning on the first date the U.S.
corporation’s properties were acquired directly or indirectly by the non-U.S. acquiring corporation and
ending 10 years after the last date the U.S. corporation’s properties were acquired, will be no less than that
corporation’s or person’s “inversion gain” for that taxable year. A person’s inversion gain includes gain from
the transfer of shares or any other property (other than property held for sale to customers) and income from
the license of any property that is either transferred or licensed as part of the acquisition or after the
acquisition to a non-U.S. related person. In general, the effect of this provision is to deny the acquired U.S.
corporation and its U.S. affiliates the use of net operating losses, foreign tax credits or other tax attributes, if
any, to offset the inversion gain. Further, more of the payments, if any, by the acquired U.S. corporation and
its U.S. affiliates to the non-U.S. acquiring corporation and its non-U.S. affiliates may be treated as base
erosion payments that may be subject to a minimum tax pursuant to Section 59A of the Code, and Baytex’s
U.S. subsidiaries could be subject to the stock buyback tax with respect to any share repurchases made by
Baytex. Additionally, dividends paid by the non-U.S. acquiring corporation will not qualify for a reduced rate
of tax as “qualified dividend income,” as discussed below under the heading “The Merger - Material

TABLE OF CONTENTS
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect
to the Ownership and Disposition of Baytex Common Shares - Distributions with Respect to Baytex
Common Shares.”
Based upon the terms of the Merger Agreement, the rules for determining share ownership under
Section 7874 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulated promulgated thereunder, and certain factual
assumptions, Baytex expects that, after consummation of the company merger, former holders of Ranger
common stock will hold less than 60% (by both vote and value) of the Baytex common shares by reason of
holding Ranger common stock as determined for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code, and accordingly,
Baytex does not expect either the 80% Ownership Test or the 60% Ownership Test to be met. Accordingly,
Baytex does not expect to be an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and Baytex intends to take this position on its tax returns. However, Baytex has not
sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS as to such tax treatment, and the closing of the company
merger is not conditioned upon achieving, any particular tax treatment or receiving a ruling from any tax
authority or opinion from any tax advisor in regards thereto. Further, there can be no assurance that your tax
advisors, the IRS or a court will agree with the position that Baytex is not an inverted corporation or a
surrogate foreign corporation pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. The rules for determining whether a
non-U.S. corporation is an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes are complex, unclear, and the subject of ongoing regulatory change. Baytex’s intended position is
not free from doubt. Further, the application of such rules must be finally determined after completion of the
company merger, by which time there could be adverse changes to the relevant facts, law, and other
circumstances.
Consistent with Baytex’s intended reporting position, the remainder of this discussion assumes that
Baytex will not be an inverted corporation or a Surrogate Foreign Corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under Section 7874 of the Code. However, Baytex is not representing to you that Baytex will not be
an inverted corporation or a Surrogate Foreign Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under
Section 7874 of the Code.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
Adverse and burdensome U.S. federal income tax rules and consequences apply to U.S. holders that
hold shares in a non-U.S. corporation classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general,
Baytex would be treated as a PFIC with respect to a particular U.S. holder in any taxable year in which, after
applying certain look-through rules to include its pro rata share of the gross income or assets, as applicable,
of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, either:
at least 75% of its gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income, which generally
includes dividends, interest, rents, royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active
conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets; or
at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and
averaged quarterly over the year) produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
Baytex expects to take the position that it is not a PFIC for the taxable year of the company merger, but
such position will not be free from doubt. The determination as to whether Baytex satisfies either or both of
the PFIC tests for the taxable year of the company merger will depend on, among other things, the timing of
the merger and the amount of Baytex’s passive income and assets in the year of the company merger.
Baytex’s PFIC status for the taxable year of the company merger or any subsequent taxable year will not be
determinable until after the end of each such taxable year, and Baytex cannot assure you that it will not be a
PFIC in the taxable year of the company merger or in any future taxable year. If Baytex were later determined
to be a PFIC, you may be unable to make certain advantageous elections with respect to your ownership of
Baytex common shares that would mitigate the adverse consequences of Baytex’s PFIC status, or making
such elections retroactively could have adverse tax consequences to you. Baytex has not sought and will
not seek any rulings from the IRS as to such tax treatment, and the closing of the company merger is not
conditioned upon achieving, any particular tax treatment or receiving a ruling from any tax authority or
opinion from any tax advisor in regards thereto. Further, there can be no assurance that your tax advisors,
the IRS or a court will agree with the position that Baytex is not a PFIC. Thus, the intended reporting
position of Baytex described herein is not free from doubt.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consistent with Baytex’s intended reporting position, the remainder of this discussion assumes that
Baytex will not be treated as a PFIC in the taxable year of the company merger or any subsequent taxable
year. However, Baytex is not representing to you that Baytex will not be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year
of the company merger or in any future taxable years.
THE PFIC RULES ARE COMPLEX AND UNCERTAIN. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT WITH, AND
RELY SOLELY UPON, THEIR TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE APPLICATION OF THE PFIC RULES
TO THEM AND ANY RESULTANT TAX CONSEQUENCES.
Distributions with Respect to Baytex Common Shares
If Baytex pays a distribution in cash or other property to U.S. holders of Baytex common shares, such
distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from
current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.
Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that
will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Baytex
common shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale of Baytex common shares
and will be treated as described below under the section entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the
Ownership and Disposition of Baytex Common Shares - Gain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Exchange
or Disposition of Baytex Common Shares.”
Dividends paid by Baytex to a corporate U.S. holder will be taxed at the regular corporate income tax rate
and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in
respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations. Dividends paid by Baytex to a non-
corporate U.S. holder generally will constitute “qualified dividend income” that will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at the tax rate accorded to long-term capital gains provided that certain requirements are met.
Those requirements include that (i) either Baytex is eligible for benefits under a qualifying comprehensive
income tax treaty with the United States or Baytex common shares are readily tradable on an established
securities market in the United States, (ii) certain holding period requirements are met, and (iii) Baytex is not
classified as a PFIC during the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or any preceding taxable year and is
not a surrogate foreign corporation under Section 7874 of the Code. If such requirements are not satisfied, a
non-corporate U.S. holder may be subject to tax on the dividend at regular ordinary income tax rates instead
of the preferential rate that applies to qualified dividend income. U.S. holders should consult with, and rely
solely upon, their tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower preferential rate for qualified dividend
income for any dividends paid with respect to Baytex common shares.
Dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be included in income in a U.S. dollar amount
based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is distributed, whether or not the currency is
converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in the non-U.S. currency will equal the U.S.
dollar amount included in income. Any gain or loss realized on a subsequent conversion or other disposition
of the non-U.S. currency for a different U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or
loss.
A U.S. holder must include any amount withheld from a dividend payment on account of taxes in income
even though the U.S. holder does not in fact receive such withheld amount. Subject to certain limitations,
Canadian tax withheld and paid over to Canada may be creditable or deductible against the U.S. holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability. Generally, an election to deduct foreign taxes instead of claiming foreign tax
credits may be made, and if such election is made, it generally applies to all foreign taxes paid or accrued in
the taxable year. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends
that are subject to preferential tax rates for qualified dividend income. To the extent a refund of the tax
withheld is available to a U.S. holder under Canadian law or under the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty, the
amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex and U.S. holders are urged to consult
their tax advisers regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances.
96 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Gain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Exchange or Disposition of Baytex Common Shares
Upon a sale or other taxable exchange or disposition of Baytex common shares, a U.S. holder generally
will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of
cash and the fair market value of any property received in such exchange or disposition and (ii) the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Baytex common shares so disposed of. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in
its Baytex common shares generally will equal the U.S. holder’s acquisition cost, less any prior distributions
paid to such U.S. holder that were treated as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For a
discussion of the tax basis of Baytex common shares received pursuant to the company merger, please see
the section entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Company Merger.” Any capital gain or loss generally will be long-
term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder held the Baytex common shares so disposed of for more than one
year. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. holders will be eligible to be taxed at reduced
rates. In addition, the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with the payment of merger
consideration to U.S. holders and, if effected by or through a U.S. office or broker, non-U.S. holders in
connection with the company merger, as well as in certain circumstances, to dividends with respect to Baytex
common shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of Baytex common shares. Further, such
U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders of Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares, as applicable,
generally will be subject to U.S. backup withholding on the merger consideration or such dividends or other
proceeds, as applicable, unless such U.S. holder provides the applicable withholding agent with, either (i) a
properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 (or other applicable or successor form) providing such U.S.
holder’s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject to backup
withholding, or, (ii) a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other
applicable or successor form) properly certifying such holder’s non-U.S. status and certain other conditions
are met, or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise complies with the backup
withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding rules or otherwise is not an
additional tax and will generally be allowed as a credit against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if
any, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the holder timely furnishes the required
information to the IRS.
Certain U.S. holders who are individuals and certain entities will be required to report information with
respect to such U.S. holder’s investment in “specified foreign financial assets” on IRS Form 8938 (Statement
of Specified Foreign Financial Assets), subject to certain exceptions. An interest in Baytex constitutes a
specified foreign financial asset for these purposes. Persons who are required to report specified foreign
financial assets and fail to do so may be subject to substantial penalties and the period of limitations on
assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply.
U.S. holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon, their tax advisors regarding the foreign financial
asset and other reporting obligations and their application to an investment in Baytex common shares.
Additional Withholding Requirements Under FATCA
Subject to the proposed U.S. Treasury regulations discussed below, Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (“FATCA”), impose
a 30% withholding tax on payments of the merger consideration, if paid to a “foreign financial institution” or
a “non-financial foreign entity”  (each as defined in the Code) (including, in some cases, when such foreign
financial institution or non-financial foreign entity is acting as an intermediary), unless (i) in the case of a
foreign financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold
on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding
U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution,
as well as certain account holders that are non-U.S. entities with U.S. owners), (ii) in the case of a non-
financial foreign entity, such entity certifies that it does not have any “substantial United States owners”  (as
defined in the Code) or provides the applicable withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct
and indirect substantial United States owners of the entity (in either case, generally on an

Ranger Oil Corp_20230518_DEFM14A_20894462_4669228.Pdf,Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations,"Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
At the merger effective time, holders of Ranger Class A common stock will receive Baytex common
shares as part of the merger consideration. The following is a general summary, as of the date hereof, of the
principal Canadian federal income tax considerations under the Canadian Tax Act of the ownership and
disposition of Baytex common shares generally applicable to a holder who, for the purposes of the Canadian
Tax Act and at all relevant times (a) is a beneficial owner of the Baytex common shares; (b) is not resident,
and is not deemed to be resident, in Canada; (c) holds the Baytex common shares as capital property; (d)
does not use or hold, and is not deemed to use or hold, the Baytex common shares in connection with
carrying on a business in Canada (a “Non-Resident Holder”); and (e) has not received or acquired its Baytex
common shares in connection with any employee stock option or executive compensation plan.
This summary is not applicable to a Non-Resident Holder that is either an “authorized foreign bank” (as
defined in the Canadian Tax Act) or an insurer that carries on an insurance business in Canada and
elsewhere. Any such Non-Resident Holder should consult its own tax advisor.
This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Canadian Tax Act and an understanding of
the current published administrative policies and assessing practices of the Canada Revenue Agency (the
“CRA”) made publicly available prior to the date hereof. The summary takes into account all specific
proposals to amend the Canadian Tax Act that have been publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister
of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the “Tax Proposals”) and assumes that the Tax Proposals will be
enacted in the form proposed. No assurance can be given that the Tax Proposals will be enacted in the form
proposed, or at all. This summary does not otherwise take into account or anticipate any other changes in
law, whether by judicial, governmental or legislative decision or action or changes in the administrative
policies or assessing practices of the CRA, nor does it take into account provincial, territorial or foreign tax
legislation or considerations, which may differ materially from those described in this summary. This
summary is also based on the assumption that the Baytex common shares will, at all relevant times, be listed
on the TSX and/or the NYSE.
This summary does not address the principal Canadian federal income tax consequences of acquiring,
holding and disposing of Baytex common shares to any person other than a Non-Resident Holder, including
any such person who is a resident of Canada for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act. Any such person should
consult their own tax advisors with respect to the consequences to them of acquiring, holding or disposing
of such securities having regard to their own particular circumstances.
98 TABLE OF CONTENTS
This summary is of a general nature only and is not, and is not intended to be, nor should it be
construed to be, legal or tax advice or representations to any particular Non-Resident Holder, and is not
exhaustive of all Canadian federal income tax considerations. Accordingly, all Non-Resident Holders are
urged to consult their own legal and tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences to them of acquiring,
holding and disposing of Baytex common shares having regard to their particular circumstances, including
the application and effect of the income and other tax laws of any country, province or other jurisdiction that
may be applicable to a Non-Resident Holder.
Dividends
Dividends paid or credited (or deemed to be paid or credited) to a Non-Resident Holder by Baytex will
be subject to Canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25%, subject to a reduction of such rate under the terms
of an applicable income tax treaty or convention. In general, in the case of a Non-Resident Holder who is a
resident of the United States for purposes of the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, who is the beneficial owner of
the dividend, and who qualifies for full benefits of the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, the rate of such
withholding tax will be reduced to 15%. Non-Resident Holders are urged to consult their own advisors to
determine their entitlement to relief under an applicable income tax treaty or convention.
Disposition of Baytex Common Shares
A Non-Resident Holder generally will not be subject to tax under the Canadian Tax Act in respect of a
capital gain realized on the disposition or deemed disposition of a Baytex common share unless the Baytex
common share constitutes (or is deemed to constitute) “taxable Canadian property” of such Non-Resident
Holder for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, and the gain is not exempt from tax pursuant to the terms of an
applicable income tax treaty or convention. Provided the Baytex common shares are listed on a “designated
stock exchange” as defined in the Canadian Tax Act (which currently includes the TSX and NYSE) at the time
of disposition, the Baytex common shares generally will not constitute taxable Canadian property of a Non-
Resident Holder unless, at any time during the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition or
deemed disposition: (i) at least 25% of the issued shares of any class or series of the capital stock of Baytex
were owned by or belonged to any combination of (a) the Non-Resident Holder, (b) persons with whom the
Non-Resident Holder did not deal at arm’s length for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, and (c) partnerships
in which the Non-Resident Holder or a person described in (b) holds a membership interest directly or
indirectly through one or more partnerships; and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value of such shares
was derived, directly or indirectly, from any combination of real or immovable property situated in Canada,
“Canadian resource property”  (as defined in the Canadian Tax Act), “timber resource property”  (as defined
in the Canadian Tax Act), or options in respect of, interests in, or for civil law rights in such properties,
whether or not such property exists. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Baytex common shares may be deemed
to be taxable Canadian property in certain circumstances specified in the Canadian Tax Act.
If the Baytex common shares are or are deemed to be taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident
Holder, any capital gain realized on the disposition or deemed disposition of such Baytex common shares
may not be subject to tax under the Canadian Tax Act pursuant to the terms of an applicable income tax
treaty or convention. Non-Resident Holders whose Baytex common shares constitute taxable Canadian
property should consult their own tax advisors.

An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains
from voting. At the Ranger special meeting, abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists. Abstentions will not count as votes cast and, therefore, will have no
effect on the outcome of the Ranger Merger Proposal, the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal or the
Ranger Adjournment Proposal.
Brokers who hold shares in street name for customers are required to vote those shares as the
customers instruct. Under applicable rules, brokers are permitted to vote on “routine” matters even if they
have not received voting instructions from their customers, but they are not permitted to vote on “non-
routine” matters absent specific voting instructions from their customers. A “broker non-vote” occurs when
a broker holds shares for a customer, which are present at the meeting, but lacks discretionary voting power
with respect to a particular proposal because the customer has not given the broker instructions regarding
how to vote those shares.
The approval of the Ranger Merger Proposal, the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal and the
Ranger Adjournment Proposal are considered non-routine matters under applicable rules. Consequently,
brokers may not vote uninstructed shares on any of these proposals, and there may be broker non-votes on
these proposals. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of any of the Ranger Proposals. Broker
shares that are voted on any matter at the Ranger special meeting will be included in determining the number
of shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Ranger special meeting.
Broker shares that are not voted on any matter at the Ranger special meeting will not be included in

permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements

RANGER PROPOSAL 1 - THE RANGER MERGER PROPOSAL
The Ranger board, after due and careful discussion and consideration, unanimously adopted and
recommended Ranger shareholder approval of the Merger Agreement, the execution, delivery and
performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the company merger contemplated thereby.
The Ranger board accordingly unanimously recommends that Ranger shareholders vote “FOR” the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, as disclosed in this proxy statement/prospectus, particularly the
related narrative disclosures in the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger” and
“The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus.
The merger between Ranger and Baytex cannot be completed without the affirmative vote of a majority
of the votes cast on the Ranger Merger Proposal at the Ranger special meeting. Abstentions, broker non-
votes and failures to vote will not count as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of
the Ranger Merger Proposal.

RANGER PROPOSAL 2 - THE RANGER COMPENSATION ADVISORY PROPOSAL
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, Ranger is seeking a non-
binding advisory shareholder approval of the compensation of Ranger’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the company merger as disclosed in “The Merger - Interests of Ranger’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Ranger’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger.” The proposal gives Ranger
shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of Ranger’s named executive
officers.
Accordingly, the Ranger board unanimously recommends that Ranger shareholders vote “FOR” the
adoption of the following resolution, on a non-binding advisory basis:
“RESOLVED, that Ranger shareholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Ranger’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the company merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger - Interests of Ranger’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger - Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Ranger’s Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger”  (which disclosure includes the compensation
table and related narrative named executive officer compensation disclosures required pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”
The vote on the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on
the Ranger Merger Proposal. Accordingly, Ranger shareholders may vote to approve the Ranger Merger
Proposal and vote not to approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal, and vice versa. If the
company merger is completed, the compensation may be paid to Ranger’s named executive officers to the
extent payable in accordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and arrangements even if the
Ranger shareholders fail to approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal. For the avoidance of
doubt, the approval of the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal is not a condition to the closing of the
company merger or otherwise required to effectuate the company merger.
Approval of the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal on a non-binding advisory basis requires
that the votes cast “FOR” the proposal exceed the votes cast “AGAINST” the proposal. Abstentions, broker
non-votes and failures to vote will not count as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome
of the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon
Ranger, Baytex or their respective boards, and approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of
the company merger.
THE RANGER BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE
RANGER COMPENSATION ADVISORY PROPOSAL.

vote in favor of any adjournment of the Ranger special meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the Ranger Merger Proposal or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to

has the power to adjourn the Ranger special meeting for any reason from time to time without notice, other
than an announcement of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, provided that a new Ranger Record

The vote on the Ranger Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the
Ranger Merger Proposal. Accordingly, a Ranger shareholder may vote to approve the Ranger Merger

The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the

merger effective time, merger sub will merge with and into Ranger, with Ranger surviving such merger as the
surviving corporation following such merger and continuing as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Baytex.
Immediately prior to the company merger, the Class B Holders (in their capacity as the sole holders of
Opco common units and Ranger Class B common stock), will exchange all of their Opco common units and
shares of Ranger Class B common stock for shares of Ranger Class A common stock. At the merger effective
time, each eligible share will be converted into the right to receive (i) 7.49 validly issued, fully paid and
109 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
nonassessable Baytex common shares with cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares, if any, and
(ii) $13.31 in cash, without interest. The merger consideration will be appropriately adjusted prior to the
merger effective time to account for any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of share or the like. All such shares of Ranger Class
A common stock will cease to be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist.
Baytex will not issue any fractional Baytex common shares in connection with the company merger. In
lieu of any fractional Baytex common shares to which a Ranger shareholder would otherwise have been
entitled, each Ranger shareholder will receive cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (i)
such fractional part of a share of Baytex common share multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average
trading price of Baytex common shares on the NYSE, as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., for the five consecutive
trading days immediately prior to the closing date.
At the merger effective time, all shares of Ranger common stock, if any, held, directly or indirectly, by
Baytex or merger sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be
automatically cancelled and cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.
Immediately following the merger effective time, all of the equity interests of merger sub issued and

Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the company merger will take place on a date that is
three business days after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver, in accordance

conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the date of closing, but subject to the satisfaction

permitted by applicable law, waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement at such time, the
closing will occur instead on the second (2nd) business day following the final day of the marketing period
(provided that Baytex may elect to terminate the marketing period early on no less than two business days’
notice to Ranger).
As soon as practicable on the closing date, Baytex and Ranger will cause (i) a certificate of merger with
respect to the company merger, to be prepared and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DLLCA, and to be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and (ii) articles

Prior to the merger effective time, Baytex will designate an exchange agent, that is mutually acceptable
to Ranger, in connection with the company merger and to receive the merger consideration to which the

for the benefit of the holders of eligible shares, the number of Baytex common shares issuable in respect of
the eligible shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Baytex will also make available to the exchange agent,

from time to time as needed, the applicable aggregate cash consideration and cash sufficient to pay any
Baytex common shares with a record date after the merger effective time (the “Post-Effective Time
Dividends”) and to make cash payments in lieu of issuing fractional shares upon the conversion of eligible
shares into the merger consideration.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash portion of the merger consideration payable upon
surrender of any eligible shares.
Baytex, Ranger, merger sub, the exchange agent, each of their respective affiliates and any other
applicable withholding agent will be entitled to deduct or withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to

deducted or withheld under applicable law (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any deduction or
withholding is required in respect of the delivery of any Baytex common shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the applicable withholding agent may withhold or deduct from the cash consideration and/or a
portion of the share consideration otherwise deliverable pursuant to the Merger Agreement).To the extent
that amounts are properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant taxing authority, such
deducted or withheld amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person from whom such amounts
would have been paid absent such deduction or withholding. If withholding is taken in Baytex common
shares, the relevant withholding agent will be treated as having sold such Baytex common shares on behalf
of the applicable person for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof at the time of such
withholding and paid such cash proceeds to the relevant taxing authority.
If any portion of the merger consideration deposited with the exchange agent is not claimed within 180
days following the closing date, such merger consideration will be delivered to Baytex or the surviving
corporation, as applicable, upon demand, and any former Ranger shareholders who have not theretofore
received the merger consideration, cash-in-lieu of fractional shares or dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Baytex common shares with a record date after the merger effective time, will
thereafter look only to the surviving corporation and Baytex for payment of their claim for such amounts.

In connection with the Merger Agreement, Baytex and the Class B Holders entered into the IRRA. The
IRRA provides for, among other things, registration rights with respect to Baytex’s common shares issued to
the Class B Holders in the company merger, certain governance matters, restrictions on transfer of such
shares and certain other matters set forth therein.
In consideration of Baytex entering into the Merger Agreement, Baytex and the Class B Holders entered
into the Support Agreement. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Class B Holders agreed, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Support Agreement, to (i) vote in favor of the company merger, (ii) not transfer
their Ranger Class B common stock and Opco common units between signing the Merger Agreement and the
closing of the Merger Transactions and (iii) complete the Opco Unit Exchange.
Certificates
As soon as practicable after the merger effective time, Baytex will cause the exchange agent to deliver to
each record holder, as of immediately prior to the merger effective time, of an outstanding certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the merger effective time represented an eligible share of Ranger Class A
common stock, a notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the company merger and a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent, and which shall be in a
customary form and agreed to by Baytex and Ranger prior to the merger effective time) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of such certificates for payment of the merger consideration pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.
Upon surrender to the exchange agent of a certificate that immediately prior to the merger effective time
represented eligible shares, together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably
required by the exchange agent, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor

withholding is required in respect of the delivery of any Baytex common shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the applicable withholding agent may withhold or deduct from the cash consideration and/or a

is taken in Baytex common shares, the relevant withholding agent will be treated as having sold such Baytex

record by the DTC or its nominees in accordance with the DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the
merger consideration (including cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Baytex common shares in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, if any) and any unpaid Post-Effective Time Dividends.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash portion of the merger consideration payable upon
surrender of any stock certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares.
Baytex, Ranger, merger sub, the exchange agent, each of their respective affiliates and any other
applicable withholding agent will be entitled to deduct or withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to
any person pursuant to the Merger Agreement or the Opco Unit Exchange any amount required to be
deducted or withheld under applicable law (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any deduction or
withholding is required in respect of the delivery of any Baytex common shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the applicable withholding agent may withhold or deduct from the cash consideration and/or a
portion of the share consideration otherwise deliverable pursuant to the Merger Agreement). If withholding
is taken in Baytex common shares, the relevant withholding agent will be treated as having sold such Baytex
common shares on behalf of the applicable person for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value
thereof at the time of such withholding and paid such cash proceeds to the relevant taxing authority.
Combined Company Management following the Company Merger and the Baytex Board Following the Company

employed by Baytex or any of its subsidiaries or (C) a combination of the foregoing.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
From and after the merger effective time, the surviving corporation shall honor all obligations and
rights under the Ranger benefit plans in accordance with their terms and under all employment,
severance, change in control, retention and other agreements, if any, between Ranger or a subsidiary
thereof and a Continuing Employee, including certain Ranger benefit plans as previously disclosed to
Baytex (provided that this will not be construed to limit any amendments or terminations otherwise
permitted by the terms of the applicable arrangements).
Baytex shall, or shall cause the surviving corporation and its respective subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to credit the Continuing Employees for purposes of vesting, eligibility,
severance and benefit accrual under any employee benefit plan (other than for any purposes with
respect to any defined benefit plans, retiree medical benefits or disability benefits, equity or equity
based award granted after the merger effective time or nonqualified deferred compensation plans) in
which the Continuing Employees participate, for such Continuing Employee’s service with Ranger
and its subsidiaries to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into
account under a corresponding Ranger benefit plan in effect immediately prior to the closing date, to
the extent that such credit does not result in duplicate benefits or compensation.
The parties shall, or shall cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health coverage of any Continuing Employee or their covered
dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements
and requirements to show evidence of good health under any employee benefit plan in which the
Continuing Employees participate to the extent such Continuing Employees or dependents are
covered under an analogous Ranger benefit plan immediately prior to the closing date and such
conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Ranger benefit plan, and (ii)
provide credit to Continuing Employees for the plan year in which the closing date occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the
closing date for which payment has been made, in each case to the extent permitted by the applicable
insurance plan provider and only to the extent such deductibles or limits for medical expenses were
satisfied or did not apply under the analogous Ranger benefit plan in effect immediately prior to the
closing date.
If requested by Baytex in writing no later than three days prior to the closing date, Ranger will cause
Ranger and its subsidiaries to take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause each Ranger 401(k)
plan to be terminated and all participants to cease participating under any such 401(k) plan, in each
case, effective no later than the business day preceding the closing date. In the event the Ranger
401(k) plan is terminated, Baytex will take any and all reasonable actions as may be reasonably
required, to cause the Baytex 401(k) plan to accept eligible rollover distributions in the form of cash in
an amount equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to the applicable Continuing
Employee from the Ranger 401(k) plan to the Baytex 401(k) plan, including any outstanding loans, and
cause each Continuing Employee to become a participant in the Baytex 401(k) plan as of the closing
date (subject to any applicable eligibility requirements).
Each Ranger employee participating in the 2022 Bonus Plan (i) received, on the regularly-scheduled
payment date for annual bonuses under the 2022 Bonus Plan an amount equal to (x) 50% times (y)
135% of the employee’s target 2022 annual bonus (such amount, the “2022 Bonus Payment”) (and
such 2022 Bonus Payment was paid in accordance with the foregoing) and (ii) will be eligible to
receive a retention bonus payment equal to the 2022 Bonus Payment within five business days
following the closing, provided that such employee either (a) remains employed with Baytex following
the closing or (b) undergoes an involuntary termination of the employee’s employment on the closing
date by Ranger or its affiliates without “cause”  (as defined in the Ranger Equity Plan) at the direction
of Baytex.
Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in Ranger’s short-term cash incentive plan for
the 2023 calendar year (the “2023 Bonus Plan” and each such Continuing Employee, a “Participating
Employee”) will cease participation in the 2023 Bonus Plan and will commence participation in
Baytex’s short-term cash incentive program for the 2023 calendar year (the “Baytex 2023 Bonus
Program”), in each case, effective as of the merger effective time. In the event that a Participating
Employee experiences an involuntary termination (a “Separated Participant”) (the date of such
Separated
122

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Participant’s termination of employment, the “Participant’s Separation Date”) prior to the regularly
scheduled payment date for annual bonuses under the Baytex 2023 Bonus Program, solely to the
extent that such Participating Employee is not already entitled to a prorated annual cash incentive
payment pursuant to an existing severance arrangement, Baytex will pay, or will cause the surviving
corporation to pay, to such Separated Participant, an amount in cash equal to the Separated
Participant’s annual cash incentive payment with respect to the 2023 calendar year, (i) based on
Baytex’s assessment of performance through the Participant’s Separation Date and (ii) prorated for
the number of days that have elapsed in such calendar year through and including the Participant’s
Separation Date, within 30 days following such Participant’s Separation Date. “Involuntary
Termination” means termination of such Participating Employee’s employment by Ranger or its
affiliates without “Cause”  (as defined in the Ranger Equity Plan). With respect to any Ranger
employee (i) who was eligible to participate in the 2023 Bonus Plan and (ii) whose employment is
terminated in an Involuntary Termination on the closing date at the direction of Baytex, solely to the
extent that such Ranger employee is not already entitled to a prorated annual cash incentive payment
pursuant to an existing severance arrangement, Baytex will, or will cause the surviving corporation
and its respective subsidiaries to, pay each such Ranger employee, an amount in cash equal to such
Ranger employee’s target annual cash incentive payment with respect to the 2023 calendar year,
prorated for the number of days that have elapsed in such calendar year through and including the
closing date, within 30 days following the closing date.
As soon as practicable following the closing, each Continuing Employee will be eligible to receive an
annual equity grant pursuant to the Baytex equity plan with equivalent grant date fair value to the
grant such employee would have received had such employee been employed by Baytex as of
January 1, 2023 (and in no event will such grant date fair value be less than the grant date fair value
of such employee’s 2023 long-term incentive plan target, as provided to Baytex by Ranger), subject to
the same terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Baytex.
Following February 27, 2023 and prior to the closing date, Baytex will, or will cause its applicable
subsidiary to, adopt a severance plan with the terms previously disclosed to Ranger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Merger Agreement is intended to (i) prevent Baytex, the
surviving corporation or any of their respective affiliates from terminating the employment or service of any
person at any time and for any reason, (ii) provide any person any right to employment or service or
continued employment or service with Baytex or any of its subsidiaries or any particular term or condition of
employment or service or (iii) prevent Baytex, the surviving corporation or any of their respective affiliates
from terminating, revising or amending any, Baytex benefit plan, Ranger benefit plan or other employee
benefit plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Baytex, Ranger or any of their respective
subsidiaries.",152,154

such Ranger equity awards (assuming maximum performance multipliers, if applicable); multiplied by
(ii) the sum of: (a) US$13.31 divided by the volume weighted average price of the Baytex common
shares on the NYSE for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the closing date as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (b) 7.49, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share.
Based on 0.9 million Ranger equity awards outstanding, assuming maximum performance multipliers
(if applicable), at May 1, 2023, and a share price of US$3.46, which is the closing share price of the
Baytex common shares on the NYSE on May 8, 2023, an estimated 10.7 million Baytex share awards
would be issued to Ranger employees. The value of this consideration is calculated as the amortized
value of the Baytex share awards issued based on the elapsed service period as of March 31, 2023
and the retained historical vesting dates of the Ranger awards.
the use of proceeds of US$1.2 billion (C$1.6 billion) from the proceeds of the issuance of the Baytex
8.500% Senior Notes and other borrowings pursuant to the Financing Transactions to fund the
US$0.6 billion (C$0.7 billion) cash portion of the merger consideration, to repay US$0.6 billion (C$0.9
billion) existing indebtedness of Ranger and to pay related fees, costs and expenses;
adjustments to convert the historical financial statements of Ranger prepared in accordance with
GAAP to IFRS and to conform to the accounting policies used by Baytex;
adjustments to translate the Ranger unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31,
2023 from USD to CAD using the period end exchange rate of $1.35, the Ranger unaudited interim
consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 from USD to
CAD using the period average rate of $1.35, and the Ranger consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2022 from USD to CAD using the 2022 average exchange rate of $1.30;
and
adjustments to present petroleum and natural gas sales and royalty expense on a gross basis on the
unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income, consistent with Baytex’s presentation
practices; the Ranger historical consolidated statement of operations presents revenues net of
royalty interests.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements contained herein do not reflect the costs of
any integration activities or benefits that may result from the realization of future cost savings from
operating efficiencies, or any other synergies that may result from the Merger Transactions.
The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions as
described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, which
Baytex management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are
presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual combined
financial information would have been if the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions actually
occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future combined results of operations
or combined financial condition. If the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions are completed,
the actual adjustments to the consolidated financial statements of Baytex will depend on a number of factors
and actual results may differ materially from the estimates used within the accompanying unaudited pro
forma consolidated financial statements.
In accordance with IFRS, Baytex will account for the Merger Transactions using the acquisition method
of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the total purchase consideration paid by Baytex in
connection with the Merger Transactions will be allocated to Ranger’s identifiable assets and liabilities
based on their fair values as of the closing of the Merger Transactions. Any excess of the total purchase
consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Ranger at
their respective fair value will be recorded as goodwill. Conversely, any excess of the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Ranger at their respective fair values over the total
purchase consideration would be recorded as a gain on acquisition. Ranger’s operating results will be
included in Baytex’s consolidated results of operations only for periods subsequent to the closing of the
Merger Transactions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented in this proxy
statement/​prospectus has been derived from the unaudited historical interim financial statements of Baytex
and Ranger as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and from the audited historical
financial statements of Baytex and Ranger for the year ended December 31, 2022. The unaudited pro forma
interim consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023 presents the financial position of
Baytex and Ranger giving pro forma effect to the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions as if
the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions had occurred on March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro
forma interim consolidated statement of income for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and for the
year ended December 31, 2022 present the results of operations of Baytex and Ranger giving pro forma effect
to the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions as if the Merger Transactions and the Financing
Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2022.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of each of Baytex and Ranger, along with the related separate
historical consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference herein. For more
information, see the section titled “Where You Can Find Additional Information” and the risk factors
described in the section titled “Risk Factors.”

On February 27, 2023, Baytex entered into the Merger Agreement with Ranger pursuant to which Ranger
and Baytex would combine through the merger of merger sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Baytex,
with and into Ranger, with Ranger continuing its existence as the surviving corporation following the
company merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Baytex. Immediately prior to the company merger,
the holders of shares of Ranger Class B common stock and common units in ROCC Energy Holdings, L.P. will
exercise their right to exchange (the “Opco Unit Exchange”) all such shares of Ranger Class B common stock
and Opco common units for Ranger Class A common stock. To effect the company merger, each share of
Ranger Class A common stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time
(including any shares issued pursuant to the Opco Unit Exchange other than certain excluded shares as
described in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive (i) 7.49 validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable Baytex common shares (the “share consideration”) and (ii) US$13.31 in cash,
without interest (the “cash consideration” and, together with the share consideration, the “merger
consideration”).
The merger consideration has been estimated to be valued at approximately C$2.2 billion (US$1.6 billion)
comprised of (i) the non-cash estimated share consideration of C$1.4 billion, which is based on 7.49 Baytex
common shares being issued per share of Ranger Class A common stock and 41.6 million shares of Ranger
common stock, including shares to be issued in the Opco Unit Exchange and shares to be issued in respect
of certain outstanding Ranger restricted stock unit awards, outstanding as of May 1, 2023, multiplied by a
share price of C$4.65, which is the closing share price of the Baytex common shares on the TSX on May 8,
2023; (ii) cash consideration of approximately C$0.7 billion, based on payment of US$13.31 per share of
Ranger Class A common stock outstanding at closing and 41.6 million shares of Ranger common stock
outstanding on May 1, 2023, converted from USD to CAD at a rate of $1.35; and (iii) estimated non-cash
share award consideration of C$33.6 million for Ranger equity awards outstanding at closing (other than
those taken into account in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)), which will be converted to time-vested Baytex
share awards. The number of Baytex share awards to be issued to each Ranger employee holding Ranger
equity awards as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions is equal to: (i) the number of
such Ranger equity awards (assuming maximum performance multipliers, if applicable); multiplied by (ii) the
sum of: (a) US$13.31 divided by the volume weighted average price of Baytex common shares on the NYSE
for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P.
and (b) 7.49, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share. Based on 0.9 million Ranger equity
awards outstanding, assuming maximum performance multipliers (if applicable), at May 1, 2023, and a share
price of US$3.46, which is the closing share price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE on May 8, 2023,
an estimated 10.7 million Baytex share awards would be issued to Ranger employees. The value of this
consideration is calculated as the amortized value of the Baytex share awards issued based on the elapsed
service period as of March 31, 2023 and the retained historical vesting dates of the Ranger awards. The
actual merger consideration will be calculated based on the trading price of Baytex common shares on the
TSX and the NYSE, the USD to CAD exchange rate and the number of shares of Ranger Class A common
stock outstanding at closing, which is expected to occur late in the second quarter of 2023 or early in the
third quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described under the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the Merger”.
On February 27, 2023, CIBC, RBC and BNS entered into a debt commitment letter with Baytex providing
for certain debt financing, the proceeds of which will be used, in part, to fund a portion of the cash
consideration and expenses of the Merger Transactions. Pursuant to the debt commitment letter, CIBC, RBC
and BNS committed to provide a new US$1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Baytex new bank facility”)
and up to a US$250 million term credit facility (the “Baytex term loan”), and CIBC and RBC committed to
provide a 364-day bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of US$500 million (the “Baytex bridge
loan”). The Baytex term loan bears interest at SOFR plus a margin. The Baytex new bank facility bears
interest at SOFR plus a margin.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Additionally, on April 27, 2023, Baytex closed a private offering of US$800 million in aggregate principal
amount of senior notes due 2030 (the “Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes”). The Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes were
priced at 98.709% of par, will bear interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum and mature on April 30, 2030. As a
result of this offering, no borrowings are available under the Baytex bridge loan.
For the purposes of these unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, Baytex has assumed
that the proceeds from the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes and Baytex term loan, along with a draw under the
Baytex new bank facility will be used to pay the cash consideration, refinance and extinguish the existing
debt of Ranger and pay related fees and expenses.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements (the “pro forma information”) of Baytex
have been prepared in connection with the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions for
inclusion in Baytex’s management information circular and Baytex’s and Ranger’s proxy
statement/prospectus. The pro forma information gives pro forma effect to the Merger Transactions and the
Financing Transactions by applying pro forma adjustments to Baytex’s and Ranger’s historical consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The pro forma reporting entity includes Baytex and its
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2023 as well as Ranger and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 2023.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023 gives effect
to the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions and assumptions described herein as if the
Merger Transactions and Financing Transactions had occurred on March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of income for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 give effect to the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions and assumptions
described herein as if the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions had occurred on January 1,
2022. The accounting policies used in the preparation of the pro forma financial information are those set out
in Baytex’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which
were prepared in accordance with IFRS. The pro forma information has been prepared from information
derived from and should be read in conjunction with:
Baytex’s unaudited interim consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023, Baytex’s
unaudited interim consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for the three month
period ended March 31, 2023, and Baytex’s audited consolidated statement of income and
comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022, together with the accompanying notes
(collectively referred to as the “Baytex historical consolidated financial statements”); and
Ranger’s unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023, Ranger’s unaudited
interim consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023, and
Ranger’s audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022,
together with the accompanying notes (collectively referred to as the “Ranger historical consolidated
financial statements”).
The Baytex historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and are
presented in CAD. The Ranger historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
GAAP and are presented in USD. For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements, adjustments have been made to the Ranger historical consolidated financial statements to
convert those financial statements to IFRS and present the information in CAD. In addition, adjustments
have been made to conform the accounting policies of Ranger to the accounting policies used by Baytex as
described in the notes to the Baytex historical consolidated financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS, using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations (“IFRS
3”), which will establish a new basis of accounting for all of Ranger’s identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities that will be assumed at fair value as of the closing of the Merger Transactions and are subject to
change. Baytex will be the acquirer for accounting purposes and Ranger will be the acquiree, based on
factors considered at the time of preparation. The purchase accounting is dependent upon certain valuations
and other studies that have yet to progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive
measurement. Baytex intends to complete the valuations and other assessments upon completion of the
155

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger Transactions and will finalize the purchase equation as soon as practicable. The various assets and
liabilities of Ranger have been measured based on preliminary estimates.
Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final purchase accounting will occur, and these
differences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements and the future results of operations and financial results of Baytex. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial statements have not been adjusted to give effect to certain expected financial benefits
of the Merger Transactions, such as tax savings, cost synergies or revenue enhancements, or the anticipated
costs to achieve these benefits, including the cost of integration or restructuring activities.
The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions as
described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, which
Baytex management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are
presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual combined
financial information would have been if the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions actually
occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future combined results of operations
or combined financial condition. If the proposed Merger Transactions and Financing Transactions are
completed, the actual adjustments to the consolidated financial statements of Baytex will depend on a
number of factors and actual results may differ materially from the estimates used within the accompanying
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements.
PRESENTATION CONFORMING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Ranger historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and
presented in USD. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, those
financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the recognition, measurement, and presentation
requirements of IFRS and presented in CAD, which is the presentation currency of Baytex. The adjustments
made to the Ranger historical consolidated financial statements are described below including certain
adjustments to conform with IFRS (“GAAP adjustments”) and adjustments to align with Baytex’s
presentation and accounting policies.
The Ranger interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 was translated from USD to
CAD using the period end exchange rate of $1.35. The Ranger interim consolidated statement of
operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 was translated from USD to CAD
using the period average exchange rate of $1.35. The Ranger consolidated statement of operations
for the year ended December 31, 2022 was translated from USD to CAD using the 2022 average
exchange rate of $1.30.
Reflects presentation conforming adjustments to reclassify and/or combine certain asset and
liability balances presented separately, or under different headings, on the face of the Ranger
consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023.
Reflects presentation conforming adjustments to reclassify and combine certain income and
expense amounts presented separately, or under different headings, on the face of the Ranger
consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and for the
year ended December 31, 2022.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements include GAAP adjustments, net of
estimated depletion on those adjustments, including:
Under IFRS, each cash generating unit comprising oil and gas properties is tested for impairment
when indicators are identified. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and
its value in use. Subsequent reversals of impairment losses are allowed, but limited to cumulative
historical impairment losses, net of subsequent depletion. Conversely, under GAAP, impairment
testing is performed at the asset group level, which may consist of multiple assets with similar
characteristics. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of the asset group
exceeds proved reserves discounted at 10%, and subsequent reversals of impairment losses are
156

prohibited. Using preliminary estimates, the fair value of the oil and gas properties of Ranger
exceeds its carrying value as of January 1, 2022 resulting in a $264.5 million impairment reversal
under IFRS which represents all historical accumulated impairments net of depletion. No such
reversal would be recognized under GAAP.
Under GAAP, depletion is calculated using proved reserves and associated finding and
development costs, while under IFRS the Company’s accounting policy is to use proved and
probable reserves and associated finding and development costs. The impact of these GAAP
differences, being the reversal of impairment and the change in reserves and associated finding
and development costs, resulted in $27.8 million of additional depletion of oil and gas properties
for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and $119.7 million of additional depletion of oil
and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Reflects the adjustment to present petroleum and natural gas sales and royalty expense on a gross
basis on the pro forma consolidated statement of income, consistent with Baytex’s presentation
practices. The Ranger historical consolidated statement of operations presents revenues net of
royalty interests.
Reflects the expensing of interest related to unproved properties which was capitalized by Ranger
under U.S. GAAP full-cost method of accounting.
Reflects Ranger historical financial information, converted to CAD and reflecting accounting and
IFRS adjustments.
The Financing Transactions are predicated on the assumption that the Merger Transactions occur
contemporaneously.
ESTIMATED PRELIMINARY PURCHASE EQUATION
The Merger Transactions will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method
of accounting whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value, with
limited exceptions. The fair values assigned to the net assets acquired are preliminary and based on
estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time of preparation of these unaudited pro
forma consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these estimates may be adjusted in the future.

Repayment of the Ranger credit facility and the Ranger senior notes is included with the presentation of
Financing Transactions in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The following assumptions have been applied in determining the above estimates:
Merger Consideration and Purchase Equation
The estimated total merger consideration of approximately C$2.2 billion includes estimated share
consideration of C$1.4 billion, estimated cash consideration of C$0.7 billion and estimated share award
consideration of $33.6 million. The sources and uses of financing are set forth in the following table and are
converted from USD to CAD at a rate of $1.35 to reflect the Merger Transactions and Financing Transactions
in the presentation currency of Baytex.

The estimated share consideration of C$1.4 billion was determined based on 7.49 Baytex common shares
being issued per share of Ranger Class A common stock outstanding and 41,570,152 shares of Ranger
common stock issued and outstanding on May 1, 2023, including (i) 19,008,710 shares of Ranger Class A
common stock and (ii) 22,548,998 shares of Ranger Class B common stock and 12,444 DSUs that will be
converted into shares of Ranger Class A common stock at closing, for an estimated aggregate total of
311,360,438 Baytex common shares to be issued. The estimated 311.4 million Baytex common shares issued is
multiplied by the share price of C$4.65, which is the closing price of the Baytex common shares on the TSX
on May 8, 2023 (the most recent practicable date for the preparation of these unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial statements) to calculate total share consideration. The estimated cash consideration is
based on payment equal to US$13.31 per share of Ranger common stock outstanding and 41.6 million shares
of Ranger common stock outstanding on May 1, 2023, converted from USD to CAD at a rate of $1.35. The
estimated non-cash share award consideration of C$33.6 million relates to the amortized value of Ranger
equity awards outstanding at closing (other than DSUs that will be converted into shares of Ranger Class A
common stock at closing), which will be converted into time-vested Baytex share awards. The number of
Baytex share awards to be issued to each Ranger employee holding Ranger equity awards as of immediately
prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions is equal to: (i) the number of such Ranger equity awards
outstanding (assuming maximum performance multipliers, if applicable); multiplied by (ii) the sum of: (a)
US$13.31 divided by the volume weighted average price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE for the
five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (b)
7.49, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share. Based on 0.9 million Ranger equity awards
outstanding at May 1, 2023, assuming maximum performance multipliers (if applicable), and a share price of
US$3.46, which is the closing share price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE on May 8, 2023, an
estimated 10.7 million Baytex share awards would be issued to Ranger employees. The value of the share
158 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
award consideration is calculated as the amortized value of the Baytex share awards issued based on the
elapsed service period as of March 31, 2023 and the retained historical vesting dates of the Ranger awards.
The total merger consideration will change based on fluctuations in the price of the Baytex common
shares on the TSX and the NYSE, the CAD:USD exchange rate and the number of shares of Ranger common
stock and Ranger equity awards outstanding at the completion of the Merger Transactions. Determinations
of fair value often require management to make assumptions and estimates about future events. The
purchase equation is preliminary as the Merger Transactions have not closed as of the date of the pro forma
information. As described in Note 2, the final purchase equation will be based on the fair value of the net
assets purchased at the closing date of the proposed company merger and other information available at that
time. There may be material differences from this pro forma purchase price equation as a result of finalizing
the valuation.
A $1 change in Baytex’s share price upon closing would have a $311.4 million impact on total merger
consideration. A $0.10 change in the CAD:USD exchange rate upon closing would have a $164.8 million
impact on total merger consideration.
Oil and gas properties
The fair value of oil and gas properties acquired was estimated based on their fair value calculated as
the present value of the estimated future cash flows after-tax associated with proved plus probable oil and
gas reserves discounted at 12.7%. Baytex’s independent reserve evaluators have provided a preliminary
assessment of Ranger’s proved plus probable reserves as of December 31, 2022, which was adjusted for
forecasted commodity prices as of May 4, 2023.
A 1% change in the discount rate would have a $110.0 million impact on the fair value of oil and gas
properties.
Other plant and equipment, working capital, financial derivatives, lease assets, lease obligations, credit
facilities and senior notes
Baytex has assumed that the carrying value is equal to fair value for other plant and equipment, working
capital (including cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other payables), financial
derivatives, lease assets and lease obligations. Additionally, the fair value of each of the Ranger credit
facilities and the Ranger senior notes is assumed to be equal to the principal balance outstanding at March
31, 2023, plus the change in control offer premium Baytex is obligated to make pursuant to the terms of the
Ranger senior notes. Trade and other payables also includes $51.4 million for transaction costs directly
attributable to the Merger Transactions expected to be incurred by Ranger prior to closing.
Asset retirement obligations
The fair value of asset retirement obligations was determined based on preliminary estimates of
expected expenditures as of March 31, 2023 and discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of 7.0%.
Deferred income tax asset
The deferred income tax asset was determined by applying statutory tax rates to the temporary
differences between the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related tax pools.
Ranger previously calculated the deferred tax liability based on the public share of these temporary
differences, which was approximately 46% at March 31, 2023. Following the Merger Transactions the
noncontrolling interest reported in Ranger’s historical consolidated financial statements will be converted to
common interest. The value of the deferred tax asset includes the increase in temporary differences
previously attributed to the noncontrolling interest, the increase in tax pools inherited following the close of
the Merger Transactions, as well as the recognition of deferred tax assets which were previously
unrecognized. The federal deferred tax assets which were previously unrecognized are now fully offset by
federal deferred tax liabilities, which enable them to be recognized in full.
The deferred tax asset does not adjust for potential synergies that could result from restructuring or
other discretionary actions, as there are currently not enough supportable facts to reliably estimate these
values. Only amounts that are directly attributable to the Merger Transactions and factually supportable
have been adjusted for.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The deferred tax assets acquired of $58.7 million is primarily related to U.S. federal income taxes. At
March 31, 2023, the Baytex historical deferred tax liability associated with U.S. federal income taxes exceeds
the deferred tax asset acquired and can therefore be used to reduce Baytex’s deferred tax liability as at March
31, 2023. As such, the deferred tax asset acquired has been presented as a reduction to the deferred tax
liability in the unaudited pro forma statement of financial position.
PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF
FINANCIAL POSITION
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023 gives effect
to the following assumptions and adjustments which are considered directly attributable to the Merger
Transactions and the Financing Transactions and factually supportable.
Cash
Financing Transactions
Reflects a net increase in cash of $748.5 million associated with Financing Transactions described in
Note 1 including an increase of $567.7 million related to a draw on the Baytex credit facilities and an increase
of $1.1 billion related to the issuance of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes, partially offset by a $324.7 million
decrease related to the repayment of the Ranger credit facilities and a $546.5 million decrease related to the
extinguishment of the Ranger senior notes, inclusive of change in control premium. The Baytex 8.500%
Senior Notes are net of $16.2 million financing costs which are capitalized against the notes and are
recognized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the note. These notes are assumed to be received
and repaid in cash.
Merger Transactions
Concurrent with the receipt of cash from the Financing Transactions described above, the net proceeds
of $748.5 million will be used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price consideration.
Oil and gas properties
Reflects a $468.3 million increase to the carrying value of Ranger’s oil and gas properties to adjust to
their estimated fair value based on preliminary estimates, as described in the purchase equation in Note 4, as
well as a $60.4 million increase related to the subsequent remeasurement of asset retirement obligations
described further in Note 5f. Balances historically presented as prepaid and other assets and assets held for
sale have been valued in conjunction with oil and gas properties and reclassified within the unaudited pro
forma consolidated statement of financial position.
Trade and other Payables
Reflects estimated transaction costs, which are directly attributable to the Merger Transactions,
incurred by both Ranger and Baytex prior to close. The Ranger transaction costs of $51.4 million attributable
to the Merger Transactions are included in trade and other payables in the purchase equation under Note 4.
Baytex transaction costs incurred as a result of Merger Transactions of $53.4 million have been included in
trade and other payables.
Baytex credit facilities
Financing Transactions
The net increase in credit facilities of $243.0 million is the result of a $243.0 million draw on the Baytex
new bank facility which is used, together with the cash generated in Financing Transactions as described in
Note 5e of $505.5 million, to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration of $748.5 million. The net
increase in credit facilities also includes the repayment of the Ranger credit facility of $324.7 million as
shown in the purchase price equation (Note 4) and the financing costs associated with the Baytex new bank
facility of $12.2 million, funded by a draw on the Baytex new bank facility of $312.5 million.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger Transactions
Reflects a $9.4 million increase in credit facilities due to the elimination of Ranger historical debt issue
costs as a result of the fair value adjustment in the purchase price equation (Note 4).
Long-term notes
Financing Transactions
Reflects a net increase in long-term notes of $505.5 million associated with Financing Transactions
described in Note 1 including an increase of $1.1 billion related to the issuance of the Baytex 8.500% Senior
Notes, partially offset by a $541.1 million decrease related to the extinguishment of the Ranger senior notes.
The Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes are net of financing costs which are capitalized against the Baytex 8.500%
Senior Notes and are recognized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the note. The issuance of the
Baytex 8.500% Senior notes are assumed to be received in cash and the repayment of the Ranger senior
notes are assumed to be paid in cash.
Merger Transactions
Reflects a $14.2 million increase in long-term notes due to the elimination of Ranger historical debt issue
costs as a result of the fair value adjustment in the purchase price equation (Note 4).
Asset retirement obligations
Reflects an increase in asset retirement obligations to adjust to its estimated fair value based on
preliminary estimates discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, as described in Note 4. Additionally,
subsequent to the initial fair value measurement, the obligations acquired were remeasured using a risk-free
rate of 3.0%, resulting in a $60.4 million increase in asset retirement obligations and oil and gas properties.
Deferred income tax liability
The decrease in deferred tax liability is mostly related to fair value assigned in the purchase price
equation as described in Note 4, as well as the deferred tax consequences of transaction costs incurred by
Baytex prior to close. As a result of the Merger Transactions, a deferred tax asset of $58.7 million has been
generated related to U.S. federal income taxes. After closing, the deferred tax asset acquired can be used to
reduce Baytex’s historical deferred tax liability related to U.S. federal income taxes. Similarly, the deferred tax
asset generated in Canada as a result of Baytex transaction costs incurred as part of the Merger
Transactions of $19.8 million can be used to reduce Baytex’s historical deferred tax liability in Canada. As a
result, no incremental deferred tax assets are included in the pro forma consolidated statement of financial
position. Since the deferred tax assets are fully offset by deferred tax liabilities in the same jurisdictions, the
Merger Transactions have instead been classified as a reduction to deferred tax liabilities.
Shareholders’ capital
Reflects an increase due to the issuance of Baytex common shares to Ranger shareholders as outlined in
the calculation of merger consideration per Note 1, partially offset by the elimination of historical Ranger
common stock.
Other equity
The decrease in other equity, including contributed surplus, accumulated other comprehensive income
and noncontrolling interest, reflects adjustments for the following:
share award consideration related to the fair value of Baytex share awards to be granted to holders
of Ranger equity awards;
the elimination of Ranger additional paid-in capital and accumulated other comprehensive income;
and
the elimination of the noncontrolling interest, which will cease to exist upon the conversion of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ranger Class B common stock to Ranger Class A common stock immediately prior to the closing of
the company merger.
Retained earnings
The decrease in retained earnings reflects adjustments for the following:
a decrease to reflect the elimination of Ranger historical retained earnings; and
a decrease to reflect $53.4 million transaction costs incurred by Baytex prior to close net of tax of
$19.8 million.
PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF
INCOME
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the three month period ended March 31,
2023 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022
gives effect to the following assumptions and adjustments, which are considered directly attributable to the
Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions. In addition, the Ranger historical consolidated
financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial statements, those financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the
recognition, measurement, and presentation requirements of IFRS.
Transaction costs
The increase in transaction costs relates to estimated fees and expenses expected to be incurred by
both Baytex and Ranger which are considered directly attributable to the Merger Transactions and are not
expected to recur beyond 12 months after closing. Transaction costs include advisory fees, legal fees, tax
fees and other professional fees, as well as post-combination severance costs for certain executives which
the Company has decided to terminate upon closing. Transaction costs incurred by Baytex and Ranger
during the three month period ended March 31, 2023 have been adjusted from the unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of income for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 as they have been
included in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Depletion and depreciation
Depletion and depreciation expense for Ranger has increased assuming that the fair value of oil and gas
properties reflected in the purchase equation were acquired on January 1, 2022. The depletion rate has been
calculated using opening proved plus probable reserves acquired in conjunction with the preliminary
estimate of reserves acquired which resulted in $14.0 million of additional depletion of oil and gas properties
for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and $75.7 million of additional depletion of oil and gas
properties for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Financing and interest
Reflects an increase in financing and interest expense of $17.8 million for the three month period ended
March 31, 2023 and an increase of $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of an
increase in outstanding debt following the issuance of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes and the increase in
debt following payment of purchase price consideration, partially offset by the repayment of the Ranger
senior notes. An average SOFR rate of 4.5%, plus applicable margins has been used to calculate interest on
the estimated average balance outstanding on the Baytex term loan and the Baytex new bank facility for the
three month period ended March 31, 2023. An average SOFR rate of 1.8%, plus applicable margins, has been
used to calculate interest on the estimated average balance outstanding on the Baytex term loan and Baytex
new bank facility for the year ended December 31, 2022.
A change in the interest rate of 1/8 percent results in a change in financing and interest expense of $0.8
million for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and a change in financing and interest expense of
$3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Deferred income tax expense
The increase in deferred tax expense reflects changes to the fair value of temporary differences, as
described in Note 5g, assuming the Merger Transactions closed at the beginning of each period presented.
Following the close of the Merger Transactions, Ranger would no longer have any accumulated
unrecognized deferred tax assets, and therefore the expense reflects Ranger net income for the three month
period ended March 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022 multiplied by the relevant statutory tax
rate.
Weighted average common shares
For the three month period ended March 31, 2023, pro forma basic weighted average shares outstanding
includes 545.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the Baytex historical
consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 plus 311.4 million
common shares issued in conjunction with the merger consideration. Pro forma diluted weighted average
shares outstanding includes 548.1 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the
Baytex historical consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2023 plus 311.4 million
common shares issued and the conversion of Ranger equity awards into 10.7 million share awards of Baytex.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, pro forma basic weighted average shares outstanding includes
558.0 million basic weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the Baytex historical consolidated
financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2022 plus 311.4 million common shares issued in
conjunction with the merger consideration. Pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding includes
563.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the Baytex historical consolidated
financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2022 plus 311.4 million common shares issued and the
conversion of Ranger equity awards into 10.7 million share awards of Baytex.
SUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA OIL, NGL AND GAS RESERVES INFORMATION
The following tables present the estimated pro forma combined net proved developed and undeveloped
oil, natural gas liquids (“NGL”), bitumen and gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, along with a summary of
changes in quantities of proved reserves during the year ended December 31, 2022. The pro forma combined
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves as of December 31,
2022, as well as changes to the standardized measure for the year ended December 31, 2022, are also
presented.
This pro forma combined reserves, production and standardized measure information gives effect to the
Merger Transactions as if they had been completed on January 1, 2022; however, the proved reserves and
standardized measures presented below represent the respective estimates made as of December 31, 2022, by
Baytex and Ranger while they were separate companies. These estimates have not been updated for changes
in development plans or other factors, which have occurred or may occur subsequent to December 31, 2022,
or subsequent to the completion of the Merger Transactions. This pro forma information has been prepared
for illustrative purposes and is not intended to be a projection of future results of the combined business.
With respect to the disclosures below, the amounts were determined by referencing the “Supplemental
Disclosures about Extractive activities - Oil and Gas (unaudited)” reported as Exhibit 99.10 in Baytex’s
Annual Report on Form 40-F and reported in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of Ranger
included in Ranger’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. An explanation of the underlying
methodology applied, as required by SEC regulations, can be found within the aforementioned Form 40-F of
Baytex and notes to the consolidated financial statements of Ranger and other documents that have been
incorporated by reference. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information” within this proxy

of Ranger who has charge of the stock
ledger of Ranger shall make, at least ten
days before every meeting of
shareholders, a complete list of the
shareholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
showing the address of each shareholder
and the number of shares registered in the
name of each shareholder. Such list shall
be open to the examination of any
shareholder, for any purpose germane to

business hours, at Ranger’s principal
place of business or both. The list shall
also be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole
time thereof and may be inspected by any
shareholder of Ranger who is present.
In the event that Ranger determines to
make the list available on an electronic

Takeover
Provisions
Under the ABCA, a merger, consolidation,
sale, lease, exchange or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the property
of Baytex other than in the ordinary
course of business of Baytex, including
an amalgamation (other than an
amalgamation with a parent or a
subsidiary or an amalgamation with a
sister corporation in accordance with the
provisions of the ABCA) and an
arrangement (as defined in the ABCA), or
a dissolution of Baytex, is generally
required to be approved by special
resolution, being a majority of not less

resolution at a meeting of Baytex
shareholders.
Additionally, Multilateral Instrument 61-
101 - Protection of Minority Security
Holders in Special Merger Transactions
(which we refer to as “MI 61-101”) of the
Canadian Securities Administrators
contains detailed requirements in
connection with, among other
transactions, “related party transactions”
and “business combinations.” A related
party transaction means, generally, any
transaction by which an issuer, directly or
indirectly, consummates one or more
specified transactions with a related party,
including purchasing or disposing of an
asset, issuing securities or assuming
liabilities. “Related party,” as defined in
MI 61-101, includes (i) directors and
senior officers of the issuer, (ii) holders of
voting securities of the issuer carrying
more than 10% of the voting rights
attached to all the issuer’s outstanding
voting securities and (iii) holders of a
sufficient number of any securities of the
issuer to materially affect control of the
issuer. A “business combination” means,
generally, any amalgamation,
arrangement, consolidation, amendment
to share terms or other transaction, as a
Control Share Acquisitions Statute.
Under the Virginia control share
acquisitions statute (Article 14.1 of the
VSCA), shares acquired in an acquisition
that would cause an acquiror’s voting
strength to meet or exceed any of three
thresholds (20%, 33 ∕3% or 50%) have no
voting rights unless (1) those rights are
granted by a majority vote of all
outstanding shares other than those held
by the acquiror or any officer or employee
director of the corporation or (2) the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of the
corporation provide that the provisions of
the control share acquisitions statute do
not apply to acquisitions of its shares. An
acquiring person that owns five percent
or more of the corporation’s voting stock
may require that a special meeting of the
shareholders be held to consider the
grant of voting rights to the shares
acquired in the control share acquisition.
This regulation was designed to deter
certain takeovers of Virginia public
corporations. Virginia law permits
corporations to opt out of the control
share acquisition statute. Ranger has not
opted out.
Affiliated Transactions. Under the
Virginia anti-takeover law regulating
affiliated transactions (Article 14 of the
VSCA), material acquisition transactions
between a Virginia corporation and any
holder of more than 10% of any class of
its outstanding voting shares are required
to be approved by the holders of at least
two-thirds of the remaining voting shares.
Affiliated transactions subject to this
approval requirement include mergers,
share exchanges, material dispositions of
corporate assets not in the ordinary
course of business, any dissolution of the
corporation proposed by or on behalf of a
10% holder or any reclassification,
including reverse stock splits,
recapitalization or merger of the

increases the percentage of voting shares
owned beneficially by a 10% holder by
more than five percent. For three years
following the time that a shareholder
becomes an interested shareholder, a
Virginia corporation cannot engage in an
affiliated transaction with the interested
shareholder without approval of two-
thirds of the disinterested voting shares
and a majority of the disinterested
directors. A disinterested director is a
director who was a director on the date on
which an interested shareholder became
an interested shareholder or was
recommended for election or elected by a
majority of the disinterested directors
then on the board. After three years, the
approval of the disinterested directors is
no longer required. The provisions of this
statute do not apply if a majority of
disinterested directors approve the

acquisition of shares making a person an
interested shareholder. As permitted by
Virginia law, Ranger has opted out of the
affiliated transactions provisions.
Bylaws
Amendments
The Baytex board may, by resolution,
make, amend or repeal any by-law that
regulates the business or affairs of
Baytex. Where the directors make, amend
or repeal a by-law, they are required under
the ABCA to submit the by-law, or the
amendment or repeal of a by-law, to the
Baytex shareholders at the next meeting
of shareholders and the shareholders may
confirm, reject or amend the by-law, by an
ordinary resolution. If the by-law,
amendment or repeal is rejected by the
shareholders, or the directors do not
submit the by-law, amendment or repeal to
the shareholders as required, the by-law,
amendment or repeal ceases to be
effective and no subsequent resolution of
the directors to make, amend or repeal a
by-law having substantially the same
purpose or effect is effective until it is
confirmed or confirmed as amended by
the shareholders.
Under the VSCA, a corporation’s
shareholders or board of directors may
amend or repeal bylaws, except to the
extent that the corporation’s articles of
incorporation or the VSCA reserve the
power exclusively to the shareholders.
The Ranger Articles provide that in
addition to any affirmative vote required
by law, any change of the Ranger Bylaws
may be adopted either:

at any regular or special meeting of the
Ranger board at which a quorum is

be amended upon a resolution of the
board of directors and, subject to certain
exceptions, approved by each voting
group entitled to vote on the amendment

any such Ranger preferred stock, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least
67% of the total voting power of all the
shares of Ranger entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class, shall be
required to amend, alter, change or repeal,

The ABCA provides that if a corporation
has property or liabilities, or both, it may
be dissolved by special resolution of the
shareholders or, if it has issued more than
one class of shares, by special
resolutions of the holders of each class
whether or not they are otherwise entitled
to vote, if: (i) by the special resolution or
resolutions, the Baytex shareholders
authorize the directors to cause the
corporation to distribute all property and
discharge all liabilities; and (ii) the

sends articles of dissolution to the
Alberta corporate Registrar.
A corporation that has no property and
no liabilities may be dissolved by special
resolution of the shareholders or, if it has
issued more than one class of shares, by
special resolutions of the holders of each

entitled to vote.
Forum Selection
Not applicable.
The Ranger Articles provide that the
United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia is the sole and
exclusive forum for any derivative action
brought on our behalf, any action
asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any
action asserting a claim arising under the
VSCA or any action asserting a claim
against us that is governed by the
internal affairs doctrine, unless the United
States District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, in which case another state
or federal court located within the
Commonwealth of Virginia will be the sole
and exclusive forum for the actions
enumerated above. The Ranger Articles
further provide that, unless we consent in
writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the sole and exclusive forum for
any complaint asserting a cause of action
arising under the Securities Act, to the
fullest extent

may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a
claim in a judicial forum that it finds
favorable for disputes with us or our
directors, officers or other employees,
which may discourage such lawsuits
against us and our directors, officers and
other employees.
Appraisal Rights
and Dissenters’
Rights
The ABCA provides that shareholders of
Baytex are entitled to exercise dissent
rights in respect of certain matters and to
be paid the fair value of their shares in
connection therewith.
Such dissent rights are applicable if
Baytex resolves to: (i) amend its articles to
add, change or remove any provisions
restricting or constraining the issue or
transfer of Baytex shares; (ii) amend its
articles to add, change or remove any
restrictions on the business(es) Baytex is
permitted to carry on; (iii) amend its
articles to add or remove an express
statement establishing the unlimited
liability of shareholders; (iv) approve
certain amalgamations; (v) continue
Baytex into another jurisdiction; (vi) sell,
lease or exchange all or substantially all of
its property; or (vii) approve an
arrangement, where the terms of the
arrangement permit dissent rights.
As Ranger is a Virginia corporation
subject to the VSCA, the shareholders of
Ranger have those appraisal rights
provided by Article 15 of the VSCA, to
the extent applicable, provided they
satisfy the special criteria and conditions
set forth in Article 15 of the VSCA.
Under Article 15 of the VSCA, no
dissenters’ or appraisal rights will be
available with respect to the company
merger, the Ranger Merger Proposal or
any of the other Merger Transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Please see “The Merger - No Appraisal

Business
Opportunities
The ABCA permits that a corporation may
waive any interest or expectancy of the
corporation in or to, or in being offered an
opportunity to participate in, a specified
business opportunity or specified classes
or categories of business opportunities
that are offered or presented to the
corporation or one or more of its officers,
directors or shareholders; provided,
however, that the corporation’s articles or
a unanimous shareholders agreement
provide the corporation with the ability to
so waive. The Baytex Articles do not
currently permit Baytex to provide such a
waiver.
Accordingly, the presentation of business
opportunities to Baytex’s officers and
directors is governed by the fiduciary
duty that such directors and officers owe
to Baytex pursuant to the ABCA and at
The Ranger Articles provide, subject to
certain limitations, that Ranger expressly
waives any fiduciary duty owed to it by
Ranger’s directors with respect to any
business opportunities that may be of
interest to Ranger, including any conflict
of interest caused if one of Ranger’s
directors takes advantage of such a
business opportunity. Ranger’s directors
may further their self-interest and engage
in such a business opportunity for their
own benefit so long as such a director did
not specifically become aware of the
opportunity in his or her capacity as a
representative of Ranger. Ranger’s

The Ranger Bylaws set forth the advance notice requirements that shareholders must follow in order to
either make a director nomination or bring any other business at any annual or special meeting of the Ranger
shareholders (other than proposals submitted for inclusion in the proxy statement governed by Rule 14a-8 of
the Exchange Act). Ranger’s Bylaws provide that only such business shall be conducted before a meeting of
the Ranger shareholders as shall have been properly brought before such meeting. To be properly brought
before a meeting, a shareholder proposal must be (i) with respect to any annual meeting, (a) specified in the
notice of meeting (or any supplement or amendment thereto) given by or at the direction of the Ranger board
or a duly authorized committee of the Ranger board, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or
at the direction of the Ranger board or a duly authorized committee of the Ranger board or (c) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by any shareholder (1) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the
giving of the notice provided for in Ranger’s bylaws and on the record date for the determination of
shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (2) who complies with the notice procedures set
forth in Ranger’s bylaws and (ii) with respect to any special meeting, specified in the notice of meeting (or
any supplement or amendment thereto) given to the Ranger shareholders by the Ranger board pursuant to
and in accordance with Ranger’s bylaws.

matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business
desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting; (ii) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made (a) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on Ranger’s books, and of
such beneficial owner, (b) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of Ranger which are
directly or indirectly (including through any derivative arrangement) owned (1) beneficially and (2) of record
by such shareholder and by such beneficial owner, (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings
between such shareholder or such beneficial owner and any other person or entity (including, without
limitation, their names) in connection with the ownership of the capital stock of Ranger and the proposal of
such business by such shareholder and such beneficial owner, and any material interest (financial or
otherwise) of such shareholder or such beneficial owner in such business, (d) whether either such
shareholder or beneficial owner intends to deliver a form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of
Ranger’s voting shares required under applicable law to approve the proposal and (e) if Ranger is then
subject to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, any other information relating to such shareholder and
beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in
connection with a solicitation of proxies for the proposal pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of

person or by proxy at the meeting to introduce the business specified in the notice.
Ranger shareholders who intend to present a proposal or nominate candidates for election to the Ranger
board at Ranger’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, must, in addition to any other applicable

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery

referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for
companies. Ranger and some brokers “household” proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to
multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Ranger Oil Corporation (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of February 27, 2023 (the “Agreement”), between the Company and Baytex Energy
Corp. (“Parent”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) certain holders of common units of ROCC
Energy Holdings, L.P. (“Opco”) and shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company will exchange such units and shares for share of the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock,” and such exchange, the “Opco Unit Exchange”), and (ii)
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent to be formed after the date hereof (“Merger Sub”) will merge
with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the entity surviving the Merger (the “Merger”)
and each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger (the “Company Merger Effective Time”) will be converted into the right to receive (a) $13.31 in
cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and (b) 7.49 common shares (such number of shares, the “Share
Consideration” and, together with the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”), without nominal or
par value, of Parent (“Parent Common Stock”); provided that, all shares of Company Common Stock held by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and, in each case, not held on
behalf of third parties shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of the Company Merger Effective
Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. The terms and conditions of the Merger
are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company Common Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company and
Parent;
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business,

compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
other transactions we deemed relevant;
reviewed the relative financial contributions of the Company and Parent to the future financial
performance of the combined company on a pro forma basis;
reviewed certain estimates as to the amount and timing of revenue enhancements (the

of the assets of Opco (the “Step-Up”) anticipated by the management of Parent to result from the
Merger;

acquisition of the Company;
reviewed a draft, dated February 27, 2023, of the Agreement; and

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to
or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the managements of
the Company and Parent that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Company Forecasts,
we have been advised by the Company, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of the
Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. With respect to the Parent Forecasts, the
Synergies, the NOLs and the Step-Up, we have been advised by Parent, and have been directed by the

performance of Parent and other matters covered thereby. We have relied, at the direction of the Company,
on the assessments of the managements of the Company and Parent as to Parent’s ability to achieve the
Parent Forecasts and the Synergies, and to realize the benefits of the NOLs and the Step-Up, and we have
assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Parent Forecasts, the Synergies, the NOLs and the Step-
Up will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected. We have relied, at the direction of the
Company, upon the assessments of the management of the Company as to the potential impact of market,
governmental or regulatory trends and developments relating to or affecting the Company and its business.
We have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or Parent, nor have we made any physical inspection of the
properties or assets of the Company or Parent. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of the
Company or Parent under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We have assumed, at the direction of the Company, that the OpCo Unit Exchange and the Merger
will be consummated in accordance with their terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the OpCo Unit Exchange and the Merger,
no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company, Parent or the
contemplated benefits of the OpCo Unit Exchange or the Merger. We have also assumed, at the direction of
Company, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement
reviewed by us.
We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other
than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein), including, without limitation, the
form or structure of the Merger, the form or structure, or financial or other terms, aspects or implications of
any related transactions, or any terms, aspects or implications of any voting or support agreements or any
governance or other arrangements, agreements or understandings entered into in connection with or related
to the Merger, any related transactions or otherwise. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock and no
opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the
holders of any class of
B-2

securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with
respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any
compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such
persons, relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as
to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available
to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the
Company to proceed with or effect the Merger. We are not expressing any opinion as to what the value of
Parent Common Stock actually will be when issued or the prices at which Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock will trade at any time, including following announcement or consummation of the Merger. We
are also not expressing any view or opinion with respect to, and we have relied, at the direction of the
Company, upon the assessment of representatives of Company regarding legal, regulatory, accounting, tax
and similar matters relating to Company or the Merger, as to which matters we understand that Company
obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, we express no opinion
or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other
matter.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee
for our services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of
which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse
our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
We and our affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities,
commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing

derivatives trading services to the Company and/or certain of its affiliates.
It is understood that this letter is for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of the Company (in
its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and
circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. As you are
aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we express no
opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on the Company, Parent or the Transaction. It
should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion, and we do not have any
obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. The issuance of this opinion was approved by a
fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities, Inc.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth

by holders of Company Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,

shareholders of the Company, however called, or at any postponement or adjournment thereof, or in any
other circumstance upon which a vote or other approval of all or some of the shareholders of the
Company is sought in connection with the Company Merger, such Shareholder shall, and shall cause
any holder of record of its Subject Shares on any applicable record date to, vote, in person or by proxy,
all of the Subject Shares beneficially owned by such Shareholder on such date, which shall, when
combined with any other shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock with respect to
which Juniper Capital Advisors, L.P. has sole or shared voting power (“Juniper Stock”), be no fewer
than a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, taken
together as a single class, outstanding as of the applicable record date and sufficient to approve the
Company Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement (such minimum number of Subject Shares, the
“Subject Shares Minimum”): (i) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of any other
matter that is required to be approved by the shareholders of the Company in order to effect the
Company Merger; (ii) against any merger agreement or merger (other than the Merger Agreement and
the Company Merger), consolidation, combination, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is prohibited by the Merger Agreement (unless, in each case, such transaction is
approved in writing by Parent) or any Company Competing Proposal; and (iii) against any amendment of
the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other proposal or transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would
reasonably be expected to materially delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the Company Merger,
the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or change in
any manner the voting rights of any outstanding class of capital stock of the Company. During the
Applicable Period, such Shareholder (and/or its Controlling Entities) shall retain at all times the right to
vote the Subject Shares Minimum (when combined with any other Juniper Stock) in such Shareholder’s
sole discretion and without any other limitation on those matters other than those set forth in this
Section 3(a) that are at any time or from time to time presented for consideration to the Company’s
shareholders generally. During the Applicable Period, in the event that any meeting of the shareholders
of the Company is held for the purpose of acting on any matter specified above, such Shareholder shall
(or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to) appear at such meeting or
otherwise cause all of the Subject Shares beneficially owned by such Shareholder on such date (which
shall be no fewer than the Subject Shares Minimum when combined with any other Juniper Stock) to be
counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum. During the Applicable Period, such
Shareholder further agrees not to commit or agree, and to cause any record holder of Subject Shares it
continues to beneficially own not to commit or agree, to take any action inconsistent with the foregoing
during the Applicable Period. “Applicable Period” means the period from and including the date of this
Agreement to and including the date of the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and without limitation of Section 12,
(i) the preceding paragraph of this Section 3(a) does not require any Shareholder to vote, or deliver a
written consent in respect of, any of its Subject Shares in favor of any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Merger Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of
such Shareholder (whether in a manner that is applicable to holders of Class A Common Stock
C-3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
generally or otherwise), and (ii) no Shareholder is required to vote, or deliver any written consent in
respect of, any of its Subject Shares, in any particular manner or at all, on any matter other than those
expressly specified in the preceding paragraph of this Section 3(a), or to appear at, or cause any of its
Subject Shares to be counted as present at, any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, or portion
thereof, held for the purpose of acting on any such other matter.
(b) Irrevocable Proxy. In order to secure the obligations set forth herein, each Shareholder hereby
irrevocably appoints Parent, or any nominee thereof, with full power of substitution and resubstitution,
as its true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact, only in the event that such Shareholder does not
comply with its obligations in Section 3(a), to vote or execute written consents with respect to such
Shareholder’s Subject Shares beneficially owned at such time (which shall be no fewer than the Subject
Shares Minimum when combined with any other Juniper Stock) in accordance with Section 3(a) and with
respect to any proposed postponements or adjournments of any meeting of the shareholders of the
Company at which any of the matters described in Section 3(a) are to be considered. Each Shareholder
hereby affirms that this proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, except upon
termination of this Agreement, and such Shareholder will take such further action or execute such other
instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy
previously granted by such Shareholder with respect to any of its Subject Shares. This proxy shall be
revoked automatically upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 (whether as to such
Shareholder or all Shareholders), and Parent may terminate this proxy at any time at its sole election by
written notice provided to each Shareholder.
(c) Transfer Restrictions. Except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 3(c) or except as
contemplated by the Opco Unit Exchange, such Shareholder agrees not to, and to cause any record
holder of its Subject Securities, not to, in any such case directly or indirectly, during the Applicable
Period (i) Transfer or enter into any agreement, option or other arrangement (including any profit
sharing arrangement) with respect to the Transfer of, any of its Subject Securities (or any interest
therein) to any Person or (ii) grant any proxies, or deposit any of its Subject Securities into any voting
trust or enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with
respect to its Subject Securities to the extent such proxies/deposits would violate Section 3(a) hereof,
other than pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 3(c), such
Shareholder further agrees not to commit or agree to take, and to cause any record holder of any Subject
Securities it continues to beneficially own not to commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing actions
during the Applicable Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Shareholder shall have the right to
Transfer its Subject Securities to an Affiliate if such Affiliate shall have agreed in writing (i) to accept
such Subject Securities subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) to be bound by
this Agreement as if it were “a Shareholder” for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such Transfer shall relieve such Shareholder from its obligations under this Agreement with respect
to any Subject Shares it continues to beneficially own.
(d) Adjustment to Subject Shares. In case of a stock dividend or distribution, or any change in the
Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or OpCo Common Units by reason of any stock
dividend or distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the term
“Subject Shares” and “Subject Securities”, as used with respect to each Shareholder, shall be deemed to
refer to and include such Shareholder’s Subject Shares or Subject Securities, as applicable, as well as all
such stock dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for which any or all of such
Shareholder’s Subject Shares or Subject Securities, as applicable, may be changed or exchanged or
which are received in such transaction, including the Opco Unit Exchange.
(e) Non-Solicitation. Except to the extent that the Company or the Company Board is permitted to
do so under the Merger Agreement, but subject to any limitations imposed on the Company or the
Company Board under the Merger Agreement, such Shareholder agrees, solely in its capacity as a
shareholder of the Company, that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, propose, knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Competing Proposal;

employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, to any Person in connection with or in response to any
Company Competing Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Company Competing Proposal; and (iv) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle,
or other agreement providing for a Company Competing Proposal. Nothing contained in this Section
3(e) shall prevent any Person affiliated with such Shareholder who is a director or officer of the
Company from taking actions in his capacity as a director or officer of the Company, including taking
any actions permitted under Section 6.3 of the Merger Agreement.
4. Class B Common Stock and Opco Common Unit Exchange. Upon the terms and subject to the

5. Tax Matters.
(a) Tax Treatment.
(i) The parties intend and agree that, for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income
tax purposes, the Opco Unit Exchange is intended to be treated as (a) a taxable sale of Opco
Common Units by the relevant Shareholders to Holdings GP under Section 741 of the Code and (b)
an incorporation of Opco in which its partners are treated as transferring to Holdings GP, and
Holdings GP is treated as receiving, the partnership interests in Opco, resulting in the termination
of the partnership pursuant to Section 708(b) of the Code, consistent with Situation 3 of Rev. Rul.
84-111, 1984-2 C.B. 88.
(ii) Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by the Transaction Documents, each
Shareholder will not take (and will prevent each of its Affiliates from taking) any actions that would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Transactions from being treated consistently with the
Intended U.S. Tax Treatment and the Opco Unit Exchange to be treated consistently with the
intended tax treatment described in Section 5(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything to the
contrary in any Transaction Document, each party acknowledges and agrees that its obligations
C-5 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to effect the Transactions are not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to the
Transactions being treated consistently with the Intended U.S. Tax Treatment or the intended tax
treatment described in Section 5(a), except as set forth in the last sentence of Section 6.17(a) of the
Merger Agreement. Each Shareholder will (and will cause each of its Affiliates to) reasonably
cooperate with Parent, the Company and their respective Tax advisors in connection with the
issuance to Parent or the Company of any customary Tax opinion or advice by its counsel or other
Tax advisors relating to the Tax consequences of the Transactions, including any such opinion to
be filed in connection with the Registration Statement, the Company Proxy Statement or the Parent
Circular. In connection therewith, each Shareholder shall deliver to such counsel or other advisors
a duly executed certificate containing customary representations, warranties and covenants as
shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable such counsel or other advisors to render
such Tax opinion or otherwise appropriately advise Parent or the Company, as applicable, with
respect to such matters, in each case dated as of such dates as may be necessary or reasonably
requested by Parent or the Company. Each Shareholder shall (and shall cause each of its Affiliates
to) provide such other customary information as is reasonably requested by such counsel or other
advisors for purposes of rendering any such Tax opinion or advice by such counsel or other
advisor.
(b) Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in the Transaction Documents to the contrary,
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent, each of their
respective Affiliates and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable to the Shareholders pursuant to the Transaction Documents any
amount required to be deducted or withheld under applicable Law; provided, however, that except in the
case of withholding required in respect of any failure by a Shareholder to deliver the forms described in
the next sentence, (a) to the extent any party becomes aware of any obligation to deduct or withhold
from amounts otherwise payable, issuable or transferable to or by a Shareholder pursuant to the
Transaction Documents, such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other
relevant parties as soon as reasonably practicable, and (b) the applicable withholding agent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the applicable Shareholder in good faith to determine
whether such deduction or withholding is required and shall reasonably cooperate with the applicable
Shareholder to minimize the amount of any applicable deduction or withholding. Each Shareholder that
transfers Opco Common Units in the Opco Unit Exchange shall deliver (i) to the Company, at or prior to
the exchange of their Opco Common Units pursuant to the Opco Unit Exchange, a duly completed and
executed Form W-9 with respect to such Shareholder, and (ii) at or prior to the Closing, a copy thereof to
Parent.
(c) Tax-Related Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Transaction Document, the indemnification obligations of the Shareholders contained in Sections
4.01(b)(ii), 5.05 and 9.04(b) of the Opco Partnership Agreement shall survive the exchange of Opco
Common Units pursuant to the Opco Unit Exchange, and to the extent that any amounts are due
pursuant to such obligations at the time of the Opco Unit Exchange or the Merger, Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent, and each of their respective Affiliates shall
be entitled to offset, without duplication, any consideration the Shareholders are otherwise entitled to
pursuant to this Agreement or the Merger Agreement by the amount of any such amounts; provided,
however, that to the extent Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, the Exchange
Agent, or any of their Affiliates becomes aware of any amounts due pursuant to any indemnification
obligations, such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Shareholders as soon as
reasonably practicable.
(d) Tax Advances During Interim Period. The Shareholders agree that they shall only be entitled to
pro rata tax distributions pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(i) of the Opco Partnership Agreement (and for the
avoidance of doubt, to waive any and all rights to any non-pro rata tax distributions or Tax Advances
(as defined in the Opco Partnership Agreement) pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(ii) of the Opco Partnership
Agreement), unless and until the Merger Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Article VIII thereof.

(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party
hereunder;
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained
herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Shareholders or Parent in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party. No waiver by any of the parties hereto of any default, misrepresentation or breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach or affect in any way
any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.
(i) Release. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, each Shareholder, on behalf of
itself and each of its officers, directors, equity holders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their
respective heirs, beneficiaries, trustees, executors, administrators, Representatives, successors and
assigns (such persons, the “Releasors”), hereby fully and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and its and their respective past, present or future officers, directors,
employees, counsel and agents, and the stockholders prior to Closing (such persons, the “Releasees”),
from and against any and all liabilities, actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages, judgments,
debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description whatsoever, whether known or unknown,
asserted or unasserted, suspected or unsuspected, absolute or contingent, unmatured or inchoate, both
at law and in equity, which Shareholders or any of the Releasors ever had, now has or may hereafter
have against any of the Releasees, on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever that arose
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to
release (a) any right of the Shareholders expressly set forth in this Agreement or the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to which it may be entitled pursuant to the Merger Agreement in accordance with
the terms thereof, (b) any right of any Releasors set forth in Section 6.10 of the Merger Agreement, (c)
any claims that any Releasor may have under the IRRA and (d) any claims that are not permitted to be
released under applicable Law or applicable public policy.
(j) Further Assurances. Each Shareholder will, from time to time, (i) at the request of Parent take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
additional or further consents, documents and other instruments as Parent may reasonably request for
the purpose of effectively carrying out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.
(k) Publicity. Except as otherwise required by law (including securities laws and regulations) and
the regulations of any national stock exchange, so long as this Agreement is in effect, no Shareholder
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to,
or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Merger Agreement, without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
(l) Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set

C-9 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that would otherwise be prohibited by Section 3(e) at the direction or encouragement of any
Shareholder or Controlling Entity.
9. Shareholder Capacity. Each Shareholder signs solely in its capacity as the record or beneficial owner
of its Subject Securities and nothing contained herein is intended to or shall limit or affect any actions taken
by any officer, director, partner, Affiliate or representative of such Shareholder who is or becomes an officer
or a director of the Company in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company, and none of such
actions in such capacity shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement. Each Shareholder signs

warranties, covenants and agreements of each Shareholder set forth in this Agreement are made severally by
such Shareholder and not jointly with any other Shareholder; and no Shareholder shall be responsible in any
way for any other Shareholder’s breach of or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
10. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy of any such breach. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, the
parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that
with respect to any damage claim that might be brought against any Shareholder under this Agreement, and
without regard to whether such claim sounds in contract, tort or any other legal or equitable theory of relief,
that damages are limited to actual damages and expressly waive any right to recover special damages,
including, without limitation, lost profits as well as any punitive or exemplary damages. The parties hereto
further agree that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court
of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that
is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of
America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware) and any
appellate court from any thereof. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts listed in this Section 10 in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) irrevocably waives the defense of an
inconvenient forum and all other defenses to venue in any such court in any such action or proceeding.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE ANY OF SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.
11. Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against, the entities that are
expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of
the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past,
present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, equityholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, advisor, consultant or Representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in Contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more parties hereto under
this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement.

or such Juniper Party’s Third Threshold Amount during the Third Lock-Up Period, another Juniper Party
may elect to sell an additional number of Registrable Securities held by such Juniper Party so long as

that the Permitted Transferee execute a joinder to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A (at which time, such Permitted Transferee will be deemed a Shareholder and Juniper Party for

and Juniper Party. Subject to Section 4(d), each Juniper Party agrees and consents to the entry of stop
transfer instructions with the Company’s transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of any
Restricted Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions; provided that, subject to the
requirements of securities Laws, the Company shall cause such stop transfer instructions to be
terminated immediately upon expiration of each applicable Lock-up Period.
(c) The Restricted Shares shall cease to be “Restricted Shares” and shall be released from the
restrictions on Transfer in Section 3(a) following each applicable Lock-Up Period; provided, further, that

Shares may be Transferred in connection with the commencement of any tender offer or exchange
offer, take-over bid, or the Company’s entry into a definitive agreement with respect to a merger,
arrangement, consolidation or other similar transaction, in each case which tender offer, exchange
offer, take-over bid or definitive agreement has been approved or recommended by the Board or a
committee thereof provided that such Transfer is subject to or conditioned upon the completion
thereof.

Transfer effected through an Underwritten Offering, Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering pursuant to
an exercise of the registration rights pursuant to Section 5, or (B) any Transfer effected through an open
market transaction, block trade (other than a Block Trade) or brokerage sale conducted through a market
maker or broker. For the purposes of determining “knowledge” for purposes of Section 4(a)(ii), excluding any
Transfers contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, the Transferring Juniper Party shall not be
required to undertake any inquiry other than reviewing (or causing the applicable Juniper Party’s legal
counsel to review) filings made by the prospective purchaser on the Commission’s EDGAR system or the

directly or indirectly, sell, offer or agree to sell such securities, or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, or

would be disposed of by someone other than such holder thereof) such securities (“Transfer”) other than in

being sold, assigned or otherwise transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act; provided,

Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission within three Business Days
after the later of the date that (A) the Company learns that no review of such Shelf Registration
Statement will be made by the Commission and (B) the Commission has no further comments on the
Shelf Registration Statement. Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, the Company
shall effect any Shelf Registration on a Form F-3 or Form S-3, or, if such forms are unavailable to the

registration for resale of the Registrable Securities and shall contain a prospectus in such form as
to permit any Shareholder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the

Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to this Section 5 is effective and Juniper provides
written notice to the Company that one or more Holders intend to effect an offering of all or part of
the Registrable Securities included on such Registration Statement, the Company will amend or
supplement such Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to enable such offering to
take place in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(iii) If any Registration Statement ceases to be effective under the Securities Act for any
reason at any time while Registrable Securities are still outstanding, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cause, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, such
Registration Statement to again become effective under the Securities Act (including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement), and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
amend, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, such Registration Statement in a manner
reasonably expected to result in the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such

Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement is filed, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement to become effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the filing thereof and (ii)
keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, available for use to
permit the Holders named therein to sell their Registrable Securities included therein and in
compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any
Registrable Securities.

form with the underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the Company or Juniper, as
applicable, as described below. Any Underwritten Demand shall specify the aggregate amount of

requested by any Holders for inclusion in such Underwritten Demand. The Demanding Holders shall
have the right to select the managing underwriter(s) to administer any Underwritten Offering related to
Underwritten Demands subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be withheld
unreasonably. In no event will the Company be required to effect (i) an Underwritten Offering if the
Company has undertaken an Underwritten Offering within 90 days preceding the date of the request for
such Underwritten Offering in which a Demanding Holder has sold securities or (ii) more than five (5)
Underwritten Offerings relating to Underwritten Demands in the aggregate; provided, that an
Underwritten Offering will not be considered made unless the selling holder disposes of at least 75% of
the Registrable Securities sought to be included in the offering; provided, further, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering shall be deemed an Underwritten
Offering for purposes of this Section 5(b)(i).

respects to clause (A)(I) below, or (ii) launch of any Underwritten Offering, in each case, filed or
requested pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) from time to time to require the Holders not to sell under
any Registration Statement or Prospectus (in which event such Holder shall discontinue sales of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement or Prospectus, but such Holder may
settle any contracted sales of Registrable Securities) or to suspend the effectiveness thereof, if such
initial effectiveness, offering launch or sale would (I) materially interfere with any active and ongoing
initial effectiveness, offering launch or sale would (I) materially interfere with any active and ongoing
material (i) financing, (ii) acquisition, (iii) corporate reorganization or (iv) merger or other material
transaction involving the Company, or (II) require the Company to prematurely disclose any material
nonpublic information the disclosure of which would be materially detrimental to the Company in each

or Underwritten Offering for more than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days, or more than ninety (90)
days total in any twelve (12)-month period; provided further, however, that in no event shall (A) such
effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 5(a)(i) be delayed under this
Section 5(c) (m) due to the negotiation, entry into or announcement of a material transaction or due to
the preparation of any periodic report or current report to be filed with the Commission (“SEC
Documents”) related to such material transaction, including historical, pro forma or “target” financial
statements to be included in such SEC Documents or (n) for a period that exceeds ten (10) calendar days

Statement more than two (2) times in a twelve-month period. The Company shall give written notice to
the Holders of its determination to delay or suspend a Registration Statement, Prospectus or
Underwritten Offering and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement no longer
exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof, and shall promptly terminate any suspension
of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other commercially reasonable actions to permit
registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement. If the Company exercises
its suspension rights under this Section 5(c), then, during such suspension period, the Company shall
not engage in any transaction involving the offer, issuance, sale or purchase of equity securities
(whether for the benefit of the Company or a third Person), except transactions involving (x) the
issuance or purchase of equity securities as contemplated by the Company’s employee benefit plans or
employee or director arrangements or (y) the issuance of equity securities as part of a transaction giving
rise to the Valid Business Reason for such suspension.
(d) Registration Statement Form. Registrations under this Section 5 shall be on such appropriate
registration form of the Commission (i) as shall be selected by the Company and as shall be reasonably
acceptable to Juniper (on behalf of the Holders), (ii) as shall permit the transfer of Registrable Securities
in accordance with the intended method or methods of transfer specified by the Holders of Registrable
Securities, it being agreed with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) that any Registration Statement shall be an
automatic shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405) if the Company is a well-known seasoned
issuer (as defined in Rule 405) at the most recent applicable eligibility determination date and (iii) any
such Registration Statement shall be on Form F-3 or similar short-form registration statement available
to the Company to the extent that the Company is eligible to use such form. If, in connection with any
registration under this Section 5, the managing underwriter, if any, shall advise the Company in writing
that in its opinion the use of another permitted form is of material importance to the success of the
offering, then such registration shall be on such other permitted form.
(e) Withdrawal. The Demanding Holders initiating an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this
Section 5 shall have the right to withdraw from such Underwritten Offering for any or no reason
whatsoever upon written notification from Juniper to the Company of the intention to withdraw from
such Underwritten Offering prior to the launch of such Underwritten Offering. Following the delivery of
any such withdrawal notice to the Company, Juniper shall promptly forward such Withdrawal Notice to
any other Holders that had elected to participate in such Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration
Expenses incurred in connection with an Underwritten Demand prior to its withdrawal. The Demanding
Holders shall be deemed to have effected an Underwritten Demand if (i) the Underwritten Demand is
launched but not consummated, unless (x) the Registration Statement applicable to such Underwritten
Offering is or becomes subject to any stop order, injunction or other Order of the Commission or other
Governmental Authority or court by reason of an act or omission by the Company, (y) the conditions to
closing specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in connection with
such Underwritten Offering are not satisfied or waived because of an act or omission by the Company
(other than a failure of the Company or any of its officers or employees to execute or deliver any closing
certificate by reason of facts or circumstances existing due to actions of any Holder) or (z) the Holders
participating in such Underwritten Offering elect to pay and have paid to the Company in full the
Registration Expenses associated with such Underwritten Offering.
(f) Piggyback Registration. If the Company at any time proposes for any reason (other than a filing
made pursuant to Section 5(a), a request made pursuant to Section 5(b) or a filing or request made
pursuant to Section 5(h)) to (i) register Common Shares under the Securities Act (other than on Form F-
4, Form S-4, Form F-8 or Form S-8 promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor forms thereto)
or (ii) consummate an Underwritten Offering, in either case, for its own account or for the account of
other Shareholders of the Company, it shall promptly give notice of such proposed action to the
Demanding Holders as soon as reasonably practicable (but in the case of filing a Registration
Statement, no later than twenty (20) days before the anticipated filing date), which notice shall (A)
describe the amount and type of securities to be included, the intended method(s) of distribution and
the name of the proposed managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, and (B) offer to all of the
Demanding Holders the opportunity to register or offer for sale such number of Registrable Securities as
such Demanding Holders may request in writing within five (5) Business Days in the case of filing a
D-10 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Registration Statement and two (2) Business Days in the case of an Underwritten Offering (unless such
offering is an overnight or bought Underwritten Offering, then one (1) Business Day), in each case after
receipt of such written notice (such Registration, a “Piggyback Registration”). The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities for which such a request(s)
is timely received by the Company to be included in such Piggyback Registration on the same terms and
conditions as the Common Shares otherwise being sold in such Piggyback Registration, and in any
event, the Company shall include the Registrable Securities on the same terms and conditions as the
Common Shares otherwise being sold in such Piggyback Registration. Any Holder shall have the right
to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to
the Company and the underwriter or underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw from
such Piggyback Registration prior to, as applicable, the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed
with the Commission with respect to such Piggyback Registration or the pricing of the Underwritten
Offering with respect to such Piggyback Registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Holder may
deliver written notice (an “Opt-Out Notice”) to the Company requesting that such Holder not receive
notice from the Company of any proposed Underwritten Offering; provided, however, that such Holder
may later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from a
Holder, the Company shall not deliver any notice to such Holder pursuant to this Section 5(f), unless
such Opt-Out Notice is revoked by such Holder. The Company (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by Persons pursuant to separate written
contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection
with a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or
abandon an Underwritten Offering in connection with a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the
launch of such Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback
Registration. For purposes of clarity, any Registration or Underwritten Offering effected pursuant to this
Section 5(f) shall not be counted as an Underwritten Offering pursuant to an Underwritten Demand
effected under Section 5(b).
(g) Cutbacks. If the managing underwriter in good faith advises the Company that the inclusion of
all Registrable Securities proposed to be included in any Underwritten Demand or Piggyback
Registration pursuant to Section 5(b) or Section 5(f) would have a negative effect on the pricing of the
Common Shares of the Company to be offered thereby, then the number of Common Shares proposed to
be included in such Underwritten Demand or Piggyback Registration shall be allocated among the
Company and the selling Holders in the following order of priority:
(i) In the case of an Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 5(b),
(A) first, to the Registrable Securities to be offered by the Holders pro rata based on the
number of shares of Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned;
(B) then, to Common Shares to be offered by the Company, if any; and
(C) then, to Common Shares to be offered by other Shareholders who are not Holders, if
any.
(ii) In the case of a registration pursuant to Section 5(f) or any other registration,
(A) first, to the Common Shares to be offered by the Company;
(B) then, to the Registrable Securities to be offered by the Holders pro rata based on the
number of shares of Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned; and
(C) then, to Common Shares to be offered by other Shareholders who are not Holders, if
any.
(h) Block Trade; Other Coordinated Offerings.
(i) Subject to Section 5(b) and Section 5(c), at any time and from time to time when an effective
Registration Statement is on file with the Commission, if a Demanding Holder wishes to engage in
(a) an underwritten registered offering not involving a “roadshow,” an offer commonly
D-11 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
known as a “block trade”  (a “Block Trade”), or (b) an “at the market” or similar registered offering
through a broker, sales agent or distribution agent, whether as agent or principal, (an “Other
Coordinated Offering”), in each case, (x) with a total offering price reasonably expected to exceed,
in the aggregate, $25 million or (y) involving all remaining Registrable Securities held by the
Demanding Holder, then if such Demanding Holder requires any assistance from the Company
pursuant to this Section 5(h), Juniper shall notify the Company of the Block Trade or Other
Coordinated Offering at least five (5) Business Days prior to the day such offering is to commence
and the Company shall as expeditiously as possible use its commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate such Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering; provided that (i) the Demanding Holders
representing a majority of the Registrable Securities wishing to engage in the Block Trade or Other
Coordinated Offering shall use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the Company and any
underwriters, brokers, sales agents or placement agents (each, a “Financial Counterparty”) prior to
making such request in order to facilitate preparation of the registration statement, prospectus and
other offering documentation related to the Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering and (ii) any
sales of Registerable Securities in Canada may only be made to the extent permitted by Canadian
Securities Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, any Registrable Securities sold under Rule 144 shall
not be deemed a Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering.
(ii) Prior to the filing of the applicable “red herring” prospectus or prospectus supplement
used in connection with a Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering, a majority-in interest of the
Demanding Holders initiating such Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering shall have the right
to withdraw from such Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering for any or no reason whatsoever
upon written notification to the Company, the underwriter or underwriters (if any) and Financial
Counterparty (if any). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a Block Trade or
Other Coordinated Offering prior to its withdrawal.
(iii) The Demanding Holder shall have the right to select the managing underwriter(s) to
administer any Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering.
(i) Holdback Agreement. In connection with any Underwritten Offering in which a Holder includes
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, each such Holder agrees to execute and deliver a
lock-up agreement pursuant to which such Holder agrees with the underwriter not to sell or purchase
any securities of the Company for the shorter of (i) the same period of time following the Underwritten
Offering as is agreed to by the Company and the other participating Holders (not to exceed the shortest
number of days that a director of the Company, “executive officer”  (as defined under Rule 3b-7 of the
Exchange Act) of the Company or any Shareholder of the Company (other than such Holder or director
or employee of, or consultant to, the Company) who owns 10% or more of the outstanding Shares
contractually agrees with the underwriters of such Underwritten Offering not to sell any securities of
the Company following such Underwritten Offering and (ii) thirty (30) days from the date of the
execution of the underwriting agreement with respect to such Underwritten Offering).
(j) Preparation and Filing. If and whenever the Company is under an obligation pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any
Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable:
(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause a Registration Statement that registers
such Registrable Securities to become and remain effective until all of such Registrable Securities
have been transferred or are no longer outstanding;
(ii) furnish, at least five (5) days before filing a Registration Statement that registers such
Registrable Securities, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus relating thereto or any
amendments or supplements relating to such a Registration Statement or such prospectuses, to one
counsel acting on behalf of all selling Holders selected by Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities to be sold (the “Sellers’ Counsel”), copies of all such documents proposed to be filed (it
being understood that such five (5) day period need not apply to successive drafts of the same
document proposed to be filed so long as such successive drafts are supplied to such counsel in
advance of the proposed filing by a period of time that is customary and reasonable under
D-12 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the circumstances), and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to reflect in each such
document, when so filed with the Commission, such comments as the Holders whose Registrable
Securities are to be covered by such Registration Statement may reasonably propose, unless
contrary to applicable Law or the Company reasonably expects that so doing would cause the
document to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
(iii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be reasonably
requested by the Holders and as may be necessary to update the list of selling stockholders therein
or to keep such Registration Statement effective (in each case including all exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein) until all of such Registrable Securities have been
transferred or are no longer outstanding and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the sale or other transfer of such Registrable Securities;
(iv) promptly notify the Sellers’ Counsel in writing (A) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to any comments by the Commission with respect to such Registration
Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or
any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing thereof or for additional
information with respect thereto, (B) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect
to the issuance or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose and (C) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of such Registrable Securities for
sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purposes;
(v) use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) register or qualify the Registrable Securities
covered by the applicable Registration Statement under such securities or “blue sky” Laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the selling Holders included in such Registration Statement (in
light of their intended plan of distribution) may request (or provide evidence satisfactory to such
selling Holders that the Registrable Securities are exempt from such registration or qualification)
and (B) cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved by such other
Governmental Authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the
Company to enable the holders of such Registrable Securities to consummate the transfer of such
Registrable Securities, provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Section 5(r), this
clause (v) does not require the Company to file a resale prospectus in any province in Canada;
(vi) furnish to each selling Holder and the underwriters or Financial Counterparties, if any,
such number of copies of such Registration Statement, any amendments thereto, any exhibits
thereto or documents incorporated by reference therein (but only to the extent not publicly
available on EDGAR or the Company’s website), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus (each in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act), and such other documents as such selling Holder, underwriters or Financial Counterparties
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public offering and sale or other transfer of such
Registrable Securities;
(vii) notify in writing on a timely basis each selling Holder at any time when the Prospectus is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, when the Company becomes aware of the
happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in such Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances then existing and, at the request of such Holder, prepare
and furnish to such Holder a number of copies reasonably requested by such Holder of a
supplement to or an amendment of such Prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter
delivered to the offerees of such Registrable Securities, such Prospectus shall not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing;

any transfer pursuant to such Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent
retained by any such Financial Counterparty, during normal business hours and at the offices
where normally kept, all pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of the Company (collectively, the “Records”), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable
them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company’s officers, managers and
employees to supply all information (together with the Records, the “Information”) reasonably
requested by any such Person in connection with such Registration Statement;

Event, a “comfort” letter from (A) the Accountants for the Company and (B) the Accountants for
any Person or business whose financial statements are required, pursuant to Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X, to be included or incorporated by reference in such Registration Statement, in each
case in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by comfort
letters given by independent certified public accountants in an underwritten public offering;

Offering, use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the underwriters and any Financial
Counterparty in such Underwritten Offering, a Block Trade or an Other Coordinated Offering

counsel for any Person or business whose financial statements are required, pursuant to Rule 3-05
of Regulation S-X to be included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, in
each case, which opinions (in form, scope and substance) will be reasonably satisfactory to the
underwriters or any Financial Counterparty, if any, and counsel to the Demanding Holders,
covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such
other matters as may be reasonably requested by such counsel and any such underwriters or
Financial Counterparty;
(xii) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, a Block Trade or an Other Coordinated Offering,
enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting or other purchase or sales agreement,
in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter or Financial Counterparty of such
offering or sale;
(xiii) provide a transfer agent and registrar (which may be the same entity) for all such
Registrable Securities and a CUSIP number for such Registrable Securities, in each case no later

(xvii) reasonably cooperate with each Holder, underwriter and Financial Counterparty
participating in the transfer of Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection

with any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(“FINRA”), including, if appropriate, the pre-filing of the Prospectus as part of a shelf registration
in advance of an Underwritten Offering, a Block Trade or an Other Coordinated Offering;
(xviii) during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities

Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering, by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities

borne by the Company, regardless of whether the Registration Statement becomes effective or any
Underwritten Offering, Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering is consummated; provided, however,
that all underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the Registrable Securities shall
not be borne by the Company, but shall be borne by the seller or sellers thereof, in proportion to the
number of Registrable Securities sold by such seller or sellers. In addition, the Company will, in any
event, pay its internal expenses (including all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees
performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any audit and the fees and expenses of any
Person, including special experts, retained by the Company.
(l) Indemnification.
(i) In connection with any registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act or
any Underwritten Offering, Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering pursuant to this Agreement,
the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of such Registrable Securities, each
underwriter, Financial Counterparty or any other Person acting on behalf of such seller and each
other Person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing Persons within the meaning of the
Securities Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to
which any of the foregoing Persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in (A) any Preliminary Prospectus, any Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any
amendment or supplement thereto, (B) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or

TABLE OF CONTENTS
or Financial Counterparty, (D) any “road show”  (as defined in Rule 433) not constituting an Issuer
Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the most recent Preliminary Prospectus
(collectively, “Road Show Material”), or (E) any filing made in connection with the qualification of
the offering under the securities or other “blue sky” Laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable
Securities are offered (collectively, “Blue Sky Filings”), (2) the omission or alleged omission to state
in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing

necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, Permitted Issuer Information, Road Show Material, Blue Sky Filings and the
Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or (3)
any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
other federal Law, any state or foreign securities Law, or any rule or regulation promulgated under
any of the foregoing Laws, relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable Securities or “blue sky”
Laws applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in
connection with such registration or qualification under such state securities or blue sky Laws; and
the Company shall reimburse such seller, underwriter, Financial Counterparty or other Person
acting on behalf of such seller and each such controlling Person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any
such case to any Holder, underwriter or Financial Counterparty to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Preliminary
Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in
any such amendment or supplement thereto or in any Permitted Issuer Information or any Road
Show Material in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Holder,
underwriter or Financial Counterparty, as the case may be, furnished to the Company through an
instrument duly executed by such Holder, underwriter or Financial Counterparty, as applicable,
specifically for use in the preparation thereof.
(ii) In connection with any registration of Registrable Securities under the Securities Act or
any Underwritten Offering, Block Trade or Other Coordinated Offering pursuant to this Agreement,
each seller of Registrable Securities shall indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to
the same extent as set forth in the preceding paragraph of this Section 5(l) the Company, each
officer of the Company who shall sign such Registration Statement, each underwriter, Financial
Counterparty or other Person acting on behalf of such seller, each Person who controls any of the
foregoing Persons within the meaning of the Securities Act and each other seller of Registrable
Securities under such Registration Statement with respect to any statement or omission from any
Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Road Show Material or Blue Sky
Filings, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information relating to such seller or Registrable Securities furnished to the Company or such
underwriter or Financial Counterparty through an instrument duly executed by such seller
specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such Preliminary Prospectus, Registration
Statement, Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto
or in any Road Show Material or Blue Sky Filings; provided, however, that the obligation to
indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each seller of Registrable Securities and that
the maximum amount of liability in respect of such indemnification shall be, limited, in the case of
each seller of Registrable Securities, to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by
such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities effected pursuant to such registration.
(iii) Indemnification similar to that specified in Sections 5(l)(i) and 5(l)(ii) shall be given by the
Company and each seller of Registrable Securities (with such modifications as may be appropriate)
with respect to any required registration or other qualification of such seller’s Registrable
Securities under any federal or state Law or regulation of Governmental Authority other than the
Securities Act.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(iv) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any
action involving a claim referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 5(l), such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is made against an indemnifying party, give
written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action (provided, however, that an
indemnified party’s failure to give such notice in a timely manner shall not relieve the indemnifying
party of any liability that it may have to the indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
the indemnifying party forfeits substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). In case
any such action is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in and to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not
be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in
connection with the defense thereof. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay
the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
and such parties have been advised by such counsel that either (A) representation of such
indemnified party and the indemnifying party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct or (B) there may be one or more legal defenses
available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party. In any of such cases referred to in clauses (i)-(iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party; it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall
not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to
any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any
settlement entered into without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of such indemnified party, effect
any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party
is a party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability for claims
that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(v) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5(l) is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, claim, damage or
liability referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified
party hereunder, shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other
in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or
liability as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that the
maximum amount of liability in respect of such contribution shall be limited, in the case of each
seller of Registrable Securities, to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such
seller from the sale of Registrable Securities effected pursuant to such registration. The relative
fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,

TABLE OF CONTENTS
remedies provided for in this Section 10(l) are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (B)
the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this Section 10(l) or anything set forth in this
Section 10(l) restrict or limit any party’s right to pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
that may be available then or thereafter.
(iii) Each party hereto further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in
response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement.
(l) Time. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is
of the essence.
(m) Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies,
legal or equitable, hereunder, and no other Person other than the parties hereto shall be entitled to rely
thereon.
(n) Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy (including any applicable rules of the NYSE, TSX,
the Commission or the Canadian Securities Regulators), all other terms, conditions and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.
(o) Outstanding Shares. Upon the request of a Juniper Party, the Company will provide an updated
calculation of the Company’s outstanding Common Shares as of the most recent practicable date.
(p) Independent Nature of Juniper Parties’ Obligations and Rights. The obligations of each Juniper
Party under this Agreement are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Juniper Party, and
no Juniper Party shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other
Juniper Party under this Agreement. The waiver by the Company of performance under this Agreement
by any Juniper Party does not excuse performance by any other Juniper Party. Nothing contained
herein, and no action taken by any Juniper Party pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute the
Juniper Parties as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a
presumption that the Juniper Parties are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such
obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. Each Juniper Party shall be entitled to
independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation, its rights arising out of this
Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Juniper Party to be joined as an additional party
in any proceeding for such purpose.

Representation and Agreement Letter
(Transfer to Street Name / Resale Registration Statement)
[•], 2023
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company 
6201 15th Avenue 
Brooklyn, New York 11219 
Attention: Restricted Transfer Department
[Broker name and address]
Baytex Energy Corp. 
[•]
With copies to:
Vinson & Elkins LLP 
845 Texas Avenue, Suite 4700 
Houston, Texas 77002 
Attention: Lande Spottswood and Michael S. Telle
The undersigned (the “Holder”) requests that the restrictive legend be removed from [•] common shares,
without nominal or par value (the “Shares”), of Baytex Energy Corp., a company incorporated under the
Business Corporations Act (Alberta) (the “Company”), and that such Shares be registered in the name of or
at the direction of [•] (the “Broker”).
In connection with the legend removal, the Holder hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with,
you that:
1. The Shares are owned of record by the Holder.
2. The Shares will be held in street name by Broker acting as custodian for the Holder.
The Shares held by the Holder were beneficially acquired from the Company and paid for in full by
the Holder (or by the predecessor holders thereof) on [•], 2023, in a transaction not involving a
public offering. Accordingly, the Shares are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144
under the Securities Act of 1933.
The Holder agrees to make any offer, sale or other transfer (of record or beneficially) of the Shares
only in compliance with one of the three following transfer provisions (the “Resale Requirements”)
and to take all steps necessary to ensure that the Holder’s affiliates, agents or brokers comply with
the Resale Requirements:
The Shares will be offered and sold in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144 applicable to
the sales of the Shares by a non-affiliate, including compliance with the holding period under
Rule 144(d) and the current reporting requirement of Rule 144(c); or
The Shares will be offered and sold in the manner described in the Company’s Registration
Statement on Form F-4, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about [•],
2023, with respect to the registration of resales by the Holder and that became effective on or
about [Insert Date] (the “Registration Statement”), and any offer or sale of all or any portion of
the Shares will be undertaken pursuant to, and in the manner described in, the Registration
Statement and any prospectus supplement thereto, including compliance with any applicable
prospectus delivery requirements; or

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Shares will be otherwise transferred (of record or beneficially) only pursuant to an
exemption to registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (or a transaction not involving an
offer or sale) and, prior to [Insert Date], only if either:
The transferee and its broker respectively enter into representation and agreement letters
in substantially the same form as this Letter and Exhibit B hereto, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company; or
The transferee takes record ownership of the Shares by one or more stock certificates
bearing restrictive legends or book-entries at the Company’s transfer agent that include a
notation of restricted security status, in either case as the Company deems appropriate.
The Holder agrees that, if the Company shall in the future determine, in the discharge of its duties
under securities laws, it is necessary to cause the Shares to be evidenced by a certificate bearing
appropriate restrictive transfer legends (or a book-entry that includes a notation of restricted
security status), the Holder will take all reasonable action to cause any Shares then owned or
controlled by the Holder to be delivered promptly to the Company’s transfer agent in exchange for
one or more stock certificates bearing restrictive legends or book-entries that include a notation of
restricted security status, in either case as the Company deems appropriate.
The Holder agrees with and for the benefit of the Company that it shall not offer or sell, or cause to
be offered or sold, Shares in violation of applicable federal, state and foreign securities laws.
The Holder agrees to cause the Broker to execute and deliver to the Company and the Company’s
transfer agent a representation letter, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto and
signed by a duly authorized representative of the Broker, certifying that the Broker will comply with
the Resale Requirements in connection with the Holder’s offer, sale or other transfer of any of the
Shares.
The Holder is knowledgeable about the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Rule 144. The Holder has seen and carefully reviewed the Registration Statement, Rule 144, and this
Letter and advises the Company that it may rely upon the representations, warranties and
agreements made herein. If and when any representation or warranty made in this Letter becomes
inaccurate or incomplete, or if any agreement in this Letter is violated, the Holder will notify the
Company promptly.
The Holder has in place internal policies and procedures, including knowledgeable and competent
compliance functions that have been notified of the requirements of this Letter, to monitor and
ensure that no offer, sale or transfer of Shares is made in violation of the foregoing restrictions.
The Company, the Company’s legal counsel, the Company’s transfer agent, the Broker, and the Holder’s
legal counsel, and their respective agents and representatives may rely on this Letter.

Effective Time (but in any event, no later than five (5) Business Days after the Company Merger Effective
Time), the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate shall pay through its standard accounts payable

Section 3.4 Payment for Securities; Exchange.
(a) Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall enter into
an agreement with a commercial bank, trust company or transfer agent that is mutually acceptable to the
Company and Parent to act as agent for the holders of Company Class A Common Stock in connection with
the Company Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration to which such
holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Article III. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible
Shares, for issuance in accordance with this Article III through the Exchange Agent, the Merger
Consideration in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to Section 3.1. In addition, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any Post-

the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 3.4(a), Section 3.4(g) and Section 3.4(h), the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and Parent Common Shares deposited
with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and
any Post-Effective Time Dividends) shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash portion of the
Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent, for
any reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the
aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III, Parent shall promptly replace, restore or
supplement (or cause to be replaced, restored or supplemented) the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make
the payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund,
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly
returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time represented Eligible Shares (“Certificates”), a notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Company Merger and a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a customary form and
agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i). Upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents
as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more Parent Common Shares (which shall be in uncertificated
book entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Common Shares, if any,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of
Company Class A Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the
applicable aggregate Cash Consideration, the cash payable in lieu of any fractional Parent Common
Shares pursuant to Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends.
(ii) Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares. Promptly after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, of Eligible Shares represented by book entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held
through the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), (A) a notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Company Merger, (B) a statement reflecting the number of Parent Common Shares
(which shall be in uncertificated book entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
Parent Common Shares, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after
taking into account all shares of Company Class A Common Stock then held by such holder) and (C) a
check in the amount equal to the applicable aggregate Cash Consideration, the cash payable in lieu of
any fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends.

Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the
Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees promptly on or after the Closing Date, upon
surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary
surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent
Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h), if any, and Post-Effective Time Dividends.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h), and Post-Effective Time
Dividends is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it shall be a
condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time
Dividends to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash to
be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and Post-
Effective Time Dividends shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Company Merger Effective Time. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4(b)(v), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Company Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares in
accordance with Section 3.4(h) and any Post-Effective Time Dividends payable in respect of such shares
of Company Class A Common Stock.
(c) Termination of Rights. All Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent
Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends, paid upon the
surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Class A Common Stock. At the
Company Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time. If, after the Company Merger Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends
payable in respect of the Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
former shareholders of the Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, upon demand, and any former Class A common shareholders of the
Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends, in
each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts.
(e) No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Company Class A Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent
Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends payable in respect of
the shares of Company Class A Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.
A-10 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(g) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Company
Merger Effective Time (“Post-Effective Time Dividends”) shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the whole Parent Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive
upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares shall be
paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Section 3.4. Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of whole
Parent Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the Post-Effective Time Dividends theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Common
Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the Post-Effective Time Dividends with a record date prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent
Common Shares. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all
whole Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to the Company Merger shall be entitled to Post-
Effective Time Dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole Parent Common
Shares were issued and outstanding as of the Company Merger Effective Time.
(h) No Fractional Parent Common Shares. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder
of Parent Common Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible
Shares exchanged pursuant to the Company Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Shares (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product
of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Shares multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average
price of the Parent Common Shares on the NYSE for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days immediately prior
to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. Promptly after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares is not a
separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off of the fractions in
the exchange.
(i) Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent, each of their respective Affiliates
and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement or the Opco Unit Exchange any amount
required to be deducted or withheld under applicable Law (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any
deduction or withholding is required in respect of the delivery of any Parent Common Shares pursuant to
this Agreement, the applicable withholding agent may withhold or deduct from the Cash Consideration
and/or a portion of the Parent Common Shares otherwise deliverable hereunder may be withheld); provided,
however, that except in the case of withholding required under applicable Law in respect of any
consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.3 or Section 3.4(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends, (i) to the
extent any Party becomes aware of any obligation to deduct or withhold from amounts otherwise payable,
issuable or transferable to or by any Person pursuant to this Agreement, such Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to notify the other relevant Parties as soon as reasonably practicable, and (ii) the
applicable withholding agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the Company or
applicable recipient in good faith to determine whether such deduction or withholding is required and shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company or applicable recipient to minimize the amount of any applicable
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the
relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such amounts would have been paid
absent such deduction or withholding, and if withholding is taken in Parent Common Shares, the relevant
withholding agent shall be treated as having sold such Parent Common Shares on behalf of such Person for
an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof at the time of such withholding and paid such cash
proceeds to the relevant Taxing Authority.

be filed or furnished under Canadian Securities Laws and under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (such
forms, reports, certifications, schedules, statements and documents, collectively, the “Parent Reporting
Documents”). As of their respective dates, (i) each of the Parent Reporting Documents, as amended,
complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will comply, as to form in all material respects with the then

the date of such amendment with respect to those disclosures that are amended), or if filed with or furnished
to the Canadian Securities Regulators or the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, will contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or

under the Exchange Act and in National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual
and Interim Filings). Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files with the SEC and with Canadian Securities Regulators is recorded,
processed, summarized and communicated to Parent’s principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act and applicable Canadian Securities Laws is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and in applicable Canadian
Securities Laws, and further reasonably designed and maintained to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of Parent’s financial reporting and the preparation of Parent financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with IFRS. There (i) is no significant deficiency or material weakness (as such term is
defined in National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings of
the Canadian Securities Regulators) in the design or operation of internal controls of financial reporting
utilized by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) is not, and since January 1, 2023, there has not been, any illegal act

credit”  (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or prohibited loans to any executive
officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes Oxley Act, the Exchange Act, any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC and applicable Canadian Securities Laws with respect to Parent Reporting
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct as of the dates

executed copy of the Debt Commitment Papers (together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto).
The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Papers will be, if
funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Papers (both before and after
giving effect to any “market flex” provisions contained in the Fee Letter), sufficient, when taken together
with available cash, lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds, for Parent to consummate
the Transactions, including the payment of the Cash Consideration and any fees and expenses of or payable
by Parent under this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Papers that are due and payable on the Closing
Date (collectively, the “Required Amount”). As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Papers have been
accepted by Parent, are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and, to Parent’s knowledge, each other party thereto, enforceable against each party thereto in accordance
with its terms, except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by the Creditors’ Rights. Parent has fully
paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or
prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Debt Commitment Papers or otherwise in connection with
the Financing. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred, and there is no condition or circumstance
existing, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute or could reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to Parent’s knowledge, any other party
thereto under the Debt Commitment Papers. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Papers other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Papers. No counterparty to the Debt Commitment Papers has any right to
impose, and Parent does not have an obligation to accept, any condition precedent to such funding other
than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Papers, or any reduction to the aggregate amount
available under the Debt Commitment Papers at Closing (nor any term or condition that would have the effect
of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Papers at Closing) to an amount that
would be insufficient for Parent to consummate the Transactions, including payment of the Required
Amount. Assuming (a) the accuracy of Company’s representations and warranties in Article IV of this
Agreement and (b) the performance by Company of its obligations in Article VI of this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not
be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing needed to pay the Required Amount will not be available
to Parent on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a failure to satisfy a condition
precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Papers. None of the
Debt Commitment Papers have

been modified or amended as of the date hereof (provided that the existence or exercise of “market flex”
provisions contained in the Fee Letter shall be deemed not to constitute a modification or amendment of the
Debt Commitment Papers) and, as of the date hereof, none of the commitments under the Debt Commitment
Papers have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, there are no other
agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party relating to the
Financing that could adversely affect the availability of the Financing that have not been disclosed to the
Company. Parent acknowledges and agrees that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its
obligations under this Agreement that Parent obtains financing (including the Financing or any alternative
financing) for, or related to, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

respective agents, consultants, independent contractors, representatives, or any other Person acting on

Parent or its Subsidiaries that would result in a violation of U.S. domestic or foreign bribery and anti-
corruption laws, including the FCPA or any other Anti-Corruption Laws. No proceeding or investigation by
or before any Governmental Entity involving Parent or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, distributors, or representatives relating to the Anti-Corruption Laws is pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent or its Subsidiaries, threatened. Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, distributors, or representatives have knowingly
falsified any entry in any book, record, or account of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and all such entries
fairly and accurately reflect the relevant transactions and dispositions of Parent’s or its Subsidiaries’ assets
in reasonable detail.

the Company has established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not
change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a
postponement or adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting permitted hereunder.

date hereof and in no event later than the 45  day following the date the Registration Statement is initially
filed with the SEC. Unless there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section
6.4(e), the Parent Board shall recommend that the shareholders of Parent approve the Parent Share Issuance,
mail the Parent Circular to the shareholders of Parent and such other persons as required by the ABCA and
solicit from shareholders of Parent proxies in favor of the Parent Share Issuance, and the Parent Circular shall
include the Parent Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent (i) may adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting (A) to allow Parent to
provide the Parent’s shareholders with any supplement or amendment to the Parent Circular that is
determined to be necessary by the Parent, acting reasonably, to comply with its fiduciary duties under the
ABCA and/or to provide Parent’s shareholders with full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating
to the Transactions and to ensure the Parent Circular does not contain a misrepresentation (as defined under
the Securities Act (Alberta)), including to provide any material disclosure anticipated to be contained in the
final Registration Statement and that was not disclosed in the Parent Circular or (B) if, as of the time for
which the Parent Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient Parent Common Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such
Parent Shareholder Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting if, as of the
time for which the Parent Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient Parent Common Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval; provided, however,
that unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Parent Shareholder Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date that is more than fifteen (15) Business Days after the immediately preceding date for
which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Parent Shareholder Meeting
shall be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)(A) and
(i)(B) exist, and such Parent Shareholder Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing clause (ii) exist); and provided further that the Parent Shareholder
Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after three (3) Business Days prior to the
Outside Date. If requested by the Company, Parent shall promptly provide the Company with all voting
tabulation reports relating to the Parent Shareholder Meeting that have been prepared by Parent or Parent’s
transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall otherwise keep the Company reasonably
informed regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written communications from or to
Parent’s shareholders with respect thereto. Unless there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in

Approval from being obtained. Once Parent has established a record date for the Parent Shareholder
Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Parent

date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting and of the record date for
each such meeting.

pursuant to Article VIII, each of the Company and Parent agrees that its obligations to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting, as applicable,
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not be affected by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation or
a Parent Change of Recommendation, as applicable, and its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not
be affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company or Parent,
as applicable, of any Company Competing Proposal or Parent Competing Proposal or other proposal

Section 6.8 Reasonable Best Efforts; HSR and Other Approvals.
(a) Except to the extent that the Parties’ obligations are specifically set forth elsewhere in this Article VI,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including Section 6.3 and Section
6.4), each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, promptly, the Company Merger and the other Transactions.
(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
promptly prepare and file all forms, notifications, declarations, registrations, notices and other submissions
required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or with the NYSE, NASDAQ or TSX prior to the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) obtain (and cooperate with each other in obtaining) any Consent,
clearance, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any
Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material
required or requested under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws) required to be obtained or made by
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with or that are necessary to
consummate the Transactions and (iii) defend any Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order

authorization, approval, Consent or waiver to effectuate the Transactions (except, for greater certainty, with
respect to any customary filing fees payable to the SEC, Canadian Securities Regulators, NYSE, NASDAQ or
TSX in connection with the Transactions). In the event that any litigation, administrative or judicial action or
other proceeding is commenced challenging the Transactions, the Parties shall cooperate with each other
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or
Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions. Additionally, Parent and the Company shall not enter into any agreement,
transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Consent,
clearance, authorization, order or approval from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to
Closing. To the extent that transfers of any permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a
result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.
(c) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the Transactions and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required Consents,
clearances, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity
undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.8. In that regard, each Party shall promptly consult
with the other Party to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to
(and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Party (or its counsel) copies of), all filings, notices or
other submissions made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by
such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions. Each Party shall promptly inform the other Party, and if in writing, furnish the other Party with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other Party orally of) any material
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions, and permit the other Party to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with,
any proposed written or oral communication with any such Governmental Entity. If either Party or any
Representative of such Party receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such Party will use reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in
substantial compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the Company shall participate in any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Entity where material issues would be reasonably expected to be
discussed in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat. The materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.8 may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, Parent, the Transaction or other confidential or
competitively sensitive information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual requirements and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege waiver risks.
(d) The Company and Parent shall file promptly (but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement) the notification and report forms required under the HSR Act. In the event
that the Parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a
“Second Request”), the Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second
Request promptly, and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second
Request review process; provided, however, the final determination as to the appropriate course of action
shall be made by Parent after consulting with the Company in advance and in good faith taking the
Company’s views into account.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the best efforts contemplated by this
Section 6.7 shall not include: (i) selling, divesting, transferring, licensing or otherwise disposing of any
assets or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or interests held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries); (ii) agreeing to behavioral, conduct, ownership and operational limitations on, including
actions and agreements that would limit the freedom of action with respect to, or the ability to own or
operate, any assets or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or interests held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries); (iii) creating, terminating, modifying, transferring or taking any other
action with respect to any relationships, agreements and contractual rights and obligations of the Company

(a) Parent agrees that for a period of 12 months following the Company Merger Effective Time (or, if an
applicable employee’s employment earlier terminates, through such date of termination) (the “Continuation
Period”), and subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.9(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable
Subsidiary of Parent to, provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is an employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing and who continues in employment with
Parent following the Closing (each, a “Continuing Employee”): (i) base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, and a target annual cash bonus opportunity, (ii) severance and termination benefits that are no
less favorable than those applicable to such Continuing Employee (if applicable) immediately before the
Company Merger Effective Time, and which severance and termination benefits are set forth in Schedule
6.9(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii) employee benefits (excluding severance and termination
benefits, defined benefit pension, post-employment health and welfare benefits, and change of control,
retention or other one-off awards (collectively, “Excluded Benefits”)) that are (A) substantially the same in
the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits to which such Continuing Employee was entitled
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (B) substantially the same in the aggregate to the
compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly-situated employees employed by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (C) a combination of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
6.9(a) shall prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from converting the method of payment for any
Continuing Employee from salaried to an hourly basis or vice versa. Parent hereby acknowledges that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a “change in control,” “change of control” or
term or concept of similar import of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the terms of the Company
Benefit Plans. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all
obligations and rights under the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms and under all
employment, severance, change in control, retention and other agreements, if any, between the Company (or
a Subsidiary thereof) and a Continuing Employee, including, but not limited to, those Company Benefit Plans
set forth on Schedule 6.9(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, it being understood that the foregoing
shall not be construed to limit any amendments or terminations otherwise permitted by the terms of the
applicable arrangements.
(b) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its respective Subsidiaries to, take reasonable best efforts to credit the Continuing
Employees for purposes of vesting, eligibility, severance and benefit accrual under any Employee Benefit
Plan (other than for any purposes with respect to any “defined benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA, retiree medical benefits or disability benefits, equity or equity based award granted after the
Company Merger Effective Time or nonqualified deferred compensation plans) in which the Continuing
Employees participate, for such Continuing Employees’ service with the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into account under a corresponding
Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that such credit does not
result in duplicate benefits or compensation.
(c) The Parties shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to use reasonable
best efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health coverage of any Continuing Employees or any of their

entering into agreements or stipulating to the entry of an order or decree or filing appropriate applications
with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing, with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any such action, at the discretion of Parent, may be conditioned upon consummation of the
Transactions; provided, further, however, that Parent shall not be required to take any action, or agree to
any condition or limitation if such actions, conditions and limitations, in the aggregate, would or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect following the Closing) to ensure that no
Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or
permanent), or establishes any Law or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the
authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Transactions, fails to do so by
the Outside Date.
Section 6.9 Employee Matters.
(a) Parent agrees that for a period of 12 months following the Company Merger Effective Time (or, if an
applicable employee’s employment earlier terminates, through such date of termination) (the “Continuation
Period”), and subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.9(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable
Subsidiary of Parent to, provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is an employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing and who continues in employment with
Parent following the Closing (each, a “Continuing Employee”): (i) base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, and a target annual cash bonus opportunity, (ii) severance and termination benefits that are no
less favorable than those applicable to such Continuing Employee (if applicable) immediately before the
Company Merger Effective Time, and which severance and termination benefits are set forth in Schedule
6.9(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii) employee benefits (excluding severance and termination
benefits, defined benefit pension, post-employment health and welfare benefits, and change of control,
retention or other one-off awards (collectively, “Excluded Benefits”)) that are (A) substantially the same in
the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits to which such Continuing Employee was entitled
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (B) substantially the same in the aggregate to the
compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly-situated employees employed by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (C) a combination of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
6.9(a) shall prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from converting the method of payment for any
Continuing Employee from salaried to an hourly basis or vice versa. Parent hereby acknowledges that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a “change in control,” “change of control” or
term or concept of similar import of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the terms of the Company
Benefit Plans. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all
obligations and rights under the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms and under all
employment, severance, change in control, retention and other agreements, if any, between the Company (or
a Subsidiary thereof) and a Continuing Employee, including, but not limited to, those Company Benefit Plans
set forth on Schedule 6.9(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, it being understood that the foregoing
shall not be construed to limit any amendments or terminations otherwise permitted by the terms of the
applicable arrangements.
(b) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its respective Subsidiaries to, take reasonable best efforts to credit the Continuing
Employees for purposes of vesting, eligibility, severance and benefit accrual under any Employee Benefit
Plan (other than for any purposes with respect to any “defined benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(35) of

Company Merger Effective Time or nonqualified deferred compensation plans) in which the Continuing
Employees participate, for such Continuing Employees’ service with the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into account under a corresponding
Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that such credit does not
result in duplicate benefits or compensation.
(c) The Parties shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to use reasonable
best efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health coverage of any Continuing Employees or any of their

covered, eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment
requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under any Employee Benefit Plan in which
the Continuing Employees participate to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible dependents are
covered under an analogous Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such
conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) give
each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which
payment has been made, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan provider and
only to the extent such deductibles or limits for medical expenses were satisfied or did not apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.
(d) Prior to the Closing Date, if requested by Parent in writing at least three (3) days before the Closing,
the Company shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to take all necessary and appropriate actions to
cause (i) each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the
“Company 401(k) Plan”) to be terminated and (ii) all participants to cease participating under the Company
401(k) Plan, in each case, effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date; provided,
however, that such actions may be contingent upon Closing. The Company shall provide Parent with an
advance copy of all documentation necessary to effect this Section 6.9(d) and a reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon prior to the adoption or execution thereof. In the event the Company 401(k) Plan is
terminated as set forth in the preceding sentence, as soon as administratively practicable following the
Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall take any and all reasonable actions as may be reasonably
required, including amendments to a defined contribution retirement plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code designated by Parent (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”) to (A) cause the Parent 401(k)
Plan to accept any “eligible rollover distributions”  (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in
the form of cash in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, including any outstanding
loans and (B) cause each Continuing Employee to become a participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan as of the
Closing Date (subject to any applicable eligibility requirements, but giving effect to the service crediting
provisions of Section 6.9(b)).
(e) On the regularly-scheduled payment date for annual bonuses under the Company’s short-term cash
incentive plan for the 2022 calendar year (the “2022 Bonus Plan”), the Company shall pay each employee
participating in the 2022 Bonus Plan that remains employed with the Company and its Subsidiaries through
such date, an amount equal to (i) 50% multiplied by (ii) 135% of such employee’s target annual bonus in
respect of calendar year 2022 (the amount in this clause (ii), the “2022 Bonus”). Within five (5) Business
Days following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its respective
Subsidiaries to, pay each Company Employee who participated in the 2022 Bonus Plan and who remains
employed through the Closing Date and (x) who continues in employment with Parent following the Closing
or (y) who undergoes an Involuntary Termination (as defined below) on the Closing Date at the direction of
Parent, an amount equal to 50% of the 2022 Bonus. For the avoidance of doubt, the payments described in
this Section 6.9(e) shall be in lieu of, and shall not be in addition to, any other payment under the 2022 Bonus
Plan. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the 2022 Bonus Plan) shall pass any necessary resolutions or take any other required action in
order to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.9(e). The Company shall provide Parent with copies
of any such resolutions or other applicable documentation (including communications to employees) prior to
approval by the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof, as applicable), communication to
employees, or other applicable action (as applicable), and shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments provided by Parent thereon.
(f) Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company’s short-term cash incentive
plan for the 2023 calendar year (the “2023 Bonus Plan” and each such Continuing Employee, a “Participating
Employee”) shall cease participation in the 2023 Bonus Plan and shall commence participation in Parent’s
short-tern cash incentive program for the 2023 calendar year (the “Parent 2023 Bonus Program”), in each
case, effective as of the Company Merger Effective Time. In the event that a Participating Employee
experiences an Involuntary Termination (a “Separated Participant”) (the date of such Separated Participant’s
termination of employment, the “Participant’s Separation Date”) prior to the regularly scheduled payment
date for annual bonuses under the Parent 2023 Bonus Program, solely to the extent that such Participating
A-67 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Employee is not already entitled to a prorated annual cash incentive payment pursuant to an existing
Severance Arrangement (as defined in Schedule 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), Parent shall pay,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, to such Separated Participant, an amount in cash equal to
the Separated Participant’s annual cash incentive payment with respect to the 2023 calendar year, (i) based
on Parent’s assessment of performance through the Participant’s Separation Date and (ii) prorated for the

Date, within thirty (30) days following such Participant’s Separation Date. “Involuntary Termination” means

Employees who are only expected to remain employed for a transition period of six (6) months or less) shall

fair value to the grant such employee would have received had such employee been employed by Parent as
of January 1, 2023 (and in no event shall such grant date fair value be less than the grant date fair value of
such employee’s 2023 long-term incentive plan target, as provided to Parent by the Company), subject to the
same terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Parent.
(h) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, adopt a severance plan with the terms set forth on Schedule 6.9(h) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter. Parent shall provide the Company with a copy of such severance plan and shall consider
in good faith any reasonable comments provided by the Company thereon.
(i) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an establishment or termination of, or an amendment to, or
be construed as establishing, terminating or amending, any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or

respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.9 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing
herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee of the

successors and assigns, any third party beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including
with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.9) under or by reason of any provision of this
Section 6.9. Nothing in this Section 6.9 is intended to (i) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates from terminating the employment or service of any Person, including a Company
Employee, at any time and for any reason, (ii) provide any Person any right to employment or service or
continued employment or service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including following the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or any particular term or condition of employment or
service, or (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates from

agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Company Merger
Effective Time and until the six (6) year anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, in the same manner
as provided by the Company immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, each Person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the

Company Merger Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts
as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, in each case, when acting in such
capacity (the “Indemnified Persons”) against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses
(including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such
Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on
or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, as applicable, or by
reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or
omission occurring or existing prior to or at, but not after, the Company Merger Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”),
including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred
in connection therewith, in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified
Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any
such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising
before or after the Company Merger Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the Company’s
regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as
promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their
best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding,
shall notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from
any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.10 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
such Party’s position with respect to such claims). With respect to any determination of whether any
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.10,
such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such
determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and
approved by Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services for Parent, Surviving
Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years.
(b) Parent Parties agree that, until the six (6) year anniversary date of the Company Merger Effective
Time, that neither Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision
in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except
to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective directors or officers existing and
in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any
Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in Section 6.10(a), relating to
the enforcement of such Indemnified Person’s rights under this Section 6.10 or under any charter, bylaw or
Contract regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder or thereunder.
(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and Parent shall fully prepay
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, “tail” insurance policies with a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective Time (the “Tail Period”) from

potential sources of financing and rating agencies that have agreed to be bound by (1) the Confidentiality
Agreement as if such Person(s) were party thereto or (2) customary confidentiality provisions (including by

Financing Sources subject to their confidentiality obligations under the Debt Financing Documents and the
definitive documentation evidencing the Financing and (ii) otherwise to the extent reasonably necessary and
consistent with customary practices in connection with the Financing subject to customary confidentiality
arrangements satisfactory to the Company, acting reasonably. Company hereby consents to the use of all of
the Company’s (and its Subsidiaries’) logos in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company,
respective Affiliates or their respective business, or the reputation or goodwill thereof. Any such
cooperation shall be provided at Parent’s expense for third party fees and expenses. For the avoidance of
doubt, any failure of the Company to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.20(b) shall not be deemed a
breach of this Agreement or excuse performance of the Parent to consummate the Transactions, so long as
the Company is acting reasonably, diligently in good faith to fulfill such obligations.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.20(b), (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective equityholders or governing bodies shall be required to pass resolutions
or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing Documents or execute or deliver

consents referred to in Section 6.20(b) or (C) as expressly contemplated by Section 6.21); (iii) neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates or any of their respective equityholders, members or Representatives shall

for any cost or expense that is subject to the expense reimbursement provision expressly set forth in Section

such action, in the good faith belief of the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company or any of its respective Affiliates; (v) no such cooperation shall be
required to the extent it would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate any Law, or result in the
contravention of, or result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any Company Contract (provided
that, (vi) any such Contract is not, and was not (if entered into prior to the date hereof), entered into in
circumvention of the cooperation contemplated herein, (y) the counterparty to such Contract is not a
Subsidiary or other Affiliate of the Company or any of their respective equityholders, members or
Representatives and (z) the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver of any such
breach or default from the counterparty thereto); and (vii) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines that such cooperation would result in a loss or waiver

not result in the events set out in this clause (vii)).
(d) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause
to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the Financing (to
the extent contemplated by the Debt Commitment Papers to be funded on the Closing Date) on the Closing
Date on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Papers. Such actions shall include, but not be limited to, using reasonable best efforts to:
(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Papers, provided that Parent may replace or amend, supplement or
waive provisions of, the Debt Commitment Papers (including adding new lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities to the Debt Commitment Papers pursuant to the terms
thereof, providing for the assignment, novation and reallocation of a portion of the financing commitments
contained therein and to grant customary approval rights to such additional entities in connection with their
addition or appointment or increase the amount of commitments under the Debt

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Financing Documents or any other definitive agreements in connection with the Financing) in accordance
with this Section 6.20(d) and Section 6.20(e); (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all Financing Conditions (unless
such conditions are waived) that are within Parent’s or its respective Affiliates’ control; and (iii) negotiate,
execute and deliver Debt Financing Documents on terms which (taken as a whole) are no less favorable to
Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Papers (including any “market flex” provisions of
the Fee Letter) with respect to the consummation of the Transactions described herein. In the event that all
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Papers have been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied)
and all closing conditions contained in Article VII of this Agreement have been satisfied (other than those
conditions which by their terms are only capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, by the party or parties thereto entitled to the benefit thereof, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing to be funded on the Closing Date. Parent shall not, without
the prior written consent of Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any
amendment, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, or
enter into any other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to, the Debt Commitment Papers, if
such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver, replacement or other agreements, side letters or
arrangements (provided that the existence or exercise of “market flex” provisions contained in the Fee Letter
shall be deemed not to constitute a modification or amendment of the Debt Commitment Papers) to the Debt
Commitment Papers would (A) reasonably be expected to make the timely funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less likely to occur, (B) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing from that contemplated in the Debt Commitment Papers to an amount less
than the Required Amount, (C) materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against any of the other parties to the Debt Commitment Papers as so amended, supplemented, modified,
waived or replaced, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any of such other parties to
the Debt Commitment Papers as in effect on the date hereof or (D) add new or additional conditions, or
otherwise expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Papers, or modify the terms of the Financing, in each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
materially prevent, impede or delay the timely funding of the Required Amount on the Closing Date or the
consummation of the Transactions. Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement of the Debt Commitment Papers in accordance with this Section 6.20(d) or Section 6.20(e) below,
Parent shall promptly deliver to Company a true and complete copy thereof (redacted in a customary manner
with respect to fee amounts, economic terms, “market flex” provisions and other customary terms), and the
terms “Debt Commitment Letter,” “Debt Commitment Papers” and “Financing” shall refer to the Debt
Commitment Papers as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced and the Financing
contemplated thereby. Parent shall keep Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and obtain any Financing upon written request by Company
therefor.
(e) Parent shall give Company prompt written notice of (i) any material breach, default, termination or
written repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Papers of which Parent or any of its Affiliates
becomes aware; (ii) the receipt by Parent of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or written repudiation
by such party to the Debt Commitment Papers, or of any provisions thereto; and (iii) the occurrence of any
event or development that Parent expects to have a materially adverse impact on the ability of Parent to
obtain the timely funding of the Required Amount on the Closing Date or to consummate the Transactions.
As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within five Business Days of the date Company delivers
to Parent a written request, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by Company relating
to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Without limiting Parent’s obligations
hereunder, if any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable (other than as a result of reductions
permitted by Section 6.20) or Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of
the Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Papers, Parent shall (A) notify Company of the occurrence thereof and the reasons therefor on a reasonably
prompt basis; (B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of
such event, alternative financing from the same or alternative financing sources (1) in an amount at least
equal to the amount of the Financing or such unavailable portion thereof and (2) which alternate financing
shall not otherwise be on terms (including structure, covenants and pricing) materially less favorable to
Parent than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Papers (including any “market flex”

status of its efforts to consummate such alternative financing; and (D) provide Company with true and
complete fully executed copies of the commitment documentation with respect to any new financing. Neither
Parent nor any of its respective Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or
replace any of the Debt Commitment Papers except as provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information that may not be disclosed in
accordance with the requirements of applicable Law.
(f) Parent shall, upon request by the Company, its current and future Affiliates, and each of their
respective current and future direct and indirect equity holders, members, partners and Representatives
(collectively, the “Company Indemnified Parties”), promptly upon demand reimburse such Company
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by such Company Indemnified Parties, as applicable, including reasonable attorney’s fees and
accountants’ fees, in connection with cooperation required under or with respect to requests made under
this Section 6.20 and Section 6.21. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement
and completion of any Financing, capital markets transactions or related transactions in connection with the
Transactions, and the performance of their respective obligations under this Section 6.20 and Section 6.21
and any information utilized in connection therewith; provided, however, that the foregoing obligations to
any Company Indemnified Party shall not apply to any information with respect to the Company or
Company’s Affiliates provided by Company or Company’s Affiliates or, at their direction, their respective
Representatives or to any losses incurred (i) as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any
such Company Indemnified Party or (ii) arising out of any material misstatement or omission of information
provided hereunder by any such Company Indemnified Party. This Section 6.20(f) shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Closing and any termination of
this Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, each Company Indemnified Party.

Class A Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into, exercisable for or settled in
shares of Ranger Class A Common Stock or (ii) the number of Parent Common Shares, or
A-107 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
securities convertible or exchangeable into, exercisable for or settled in Parent Common Shares, in each
case issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by reason of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect
of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 4(c).
(d) Treatment of Ranger Equity Awards.
(i) Ranger TRSU Awards and Ranger PBRSU Awards. Each outstanding award of restricted
stock units subject to time-based vesting issued pursuant to Ranger’s 2019 Management Incentive
Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the “Ranger Equity Plan”), that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Ranger TRSU Award”), other than those Ranger
TRSU Awards held by Ranger’s non-employee directors (“Director TRSU Awards”), and each
outstanding award of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting issued pursuant
to the Ranger Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
“Ranger PBRSU Award”) shall be converted into time-vested awards with respect to Parent Common
Shares (“Converted Parent TRSU Awards”) at the closing of the Merger (“Closing”), with the number
of Parent Common Shares subject to the Converted Parent TRSU Awards equal to the product of (x)
the number of shares of Ranger Common Stock subject to the Ranger TRSU Award or Ranger
PBRSU Award (at the maximum level of performance), as applicable, multiplied by (y) the sum of (i)
the Cash Consideration divided by the volume weighted average price of the Parent Common
Shares on the NYSE (as defined below) for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately prior
to the Closing Date (as defined below) as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (ii) the Share
Consideration, rounded up to the nearest whole Parent Common Share. Converted Parent TRSU
Awards in respect of Ranger TRSU Awards will remain subject to the same vesting schedule and
Converted Parent TRSU Awards in respect of Ranger PBRSU Awards will be converted based on
the number of shares payable upon maximum performance and will remain subject to the same time-
vesting schedule; provided, however, that upon (x) an involuntary termination of the holder’s
employment or service by Parent, Ranger or any of their subsidiaries without cause or (y) solely
with respect to a Converted Parent TRSU Award that was converted from a Ranger TRSU Award or
a Ranger PBRSU Award that had such a provision in the award agreement pursuant to which such
Ranger TRSU Award or Ranger PBRSU Award (as applicable) was granted, a resignation by the
holder for good reason, in each case, that occurs on or within twelve (12) months following the
Effective Time, such awards will immediately vest in full as of such termination date. For the
avoidance of doubt, any dividend equivalents that have been accrued with respect to the Ranger
TRSU Awards or Ranger PBRSU Awards will become payable ratably if and when such underlying
Converted Parent TRSU Award vests.
(ii) Director TRSU Awards. Each Director TRSU Award shall vest in full at the Effective Time
and, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any action by the Parties, be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive, at the Effective Time, without interest, the Merger
Consideration with respect to each share of Ranger Common Stock subject to such Director TRSU
Award plus the amount of any dividend equivalents payable with respect to such Director TRSU
Award that remain unpaid as of the Effective Time (the “TRSU Consideration”). Following the
Effective Time, no such Director TRSU Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of a Director TRSU Award shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right (if any) to receive the TRSU
Consideration in exchange for such Director TRSU Award. No fractional Parent Common Share shall
be issued as part of TRSU Consideration, and any such fractional Parent Common Share shall
instead be paid in cash in accordance with Section 5(h).
(iii) Payments with Respect to Director TRSU Awards. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event, no later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate shall pay through its standard accounts payable
procedures the cash amounts due pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in the case of any TRSU Consideration that constitutes non-qualified deferred
A-108 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and any successor statute,
as amended from time to time (the “Code”), Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
Affiliate shall issue or pay such TRSU Consideration, as applicable, at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
5. Payment for Securities; Exchange.
(a) Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with a commercial bank, trust company or transfer agent that is mutually acceptable to
Ranger and Parent to act as agent for the holders of Ranger Class A Common Stock in connection with
the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders shall
become entitled pursuant to this Section 5. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in
accordance with this Section 5 through the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration in respect of
Eligible Shares pursuant to Section 4(b). In addition, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any Post-Effective Time
Dividends and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 5(h). The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund (as defined
below). Except as contemplated by this Section 5(a), Section 5(g) and Section 5(h), the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and Parent Common Shares deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with 5(h) and any Post-
Effective Time Dividends) shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent, for any
reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the
aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Section 5, Parent shall promptly replace, restore or
supplement (or cause to be replaced, restored or supplemented) the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to
make the payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Section 5. Any interest or other
income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of
Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an
outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Eligible Shares (“Certificates”), a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger
and a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent
and Ranger prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates
for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 4(b)(i). Upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may
be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more Parent Common Shares (which shall be in
uncertificated book entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent
Common Shares, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 4(b) (after
taking into account all shares of Ranger Class A Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a
check in the amount equal to the applicable aggregate Cash Consideration, the cash payable in lieu
of any fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 5(h) and Post-Effective Time
Dividends.
A-109 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(ii) Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of
Eligible Shares represented by book entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held through the Depository
Trust Ranger (“DTC”), (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a
statement reflecting the number of Parent Common Shares (which shall be in uncertificated book
entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number Parent Common Shares, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 4(b) (after taking into account all shares of
Ranger Class A Common Stock then held by such holder) and (C) a check in the amount equal to
the applicable aggregate Cash Consideration, the cash payable in lieu of any fractional Parent
Common Shares pursuant to Section 5(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends.
(iii) DTC Book-Entry Shares. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and
Ranger shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that
the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees promptly on or after the Closing Date,
upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s
customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 5(h), if any, and Post-Effective Time
Dividends.
(iv) No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible Shares pursuant to
this Section 5.
(v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in
lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 5(h), and Post-Effective
Time Dividends is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it
shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration, any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 5(h) and
Post-Effective Time Dividends to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of
the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares in
accordance with Section 5(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends shall only be made to the Person
in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of Ranger as of
the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 5(b)(v), each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common
Shares in accordance with Section 5(h) and any Post-Effective Time Dividends payable in respect
of such shares of Ranger Class A Common Stock.
(c) Termination of Rights. All Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 5(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends, paid upon
the surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Ranger Class A Common Stock. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Ranger shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Ranger of the shares of Ranger Class A
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common
Shares in accordance with Section 5(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends payable in respect of the
Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the former shareholders of Ranger on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, upon demand, and any former Class A common shareholders
of Ranger who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any
A-110 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 5(h) and
Post-Effective Time Dividends, in each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under
this Section 5 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of their
claim for such amounts.
(e) No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of Ranger Class A Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at
which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section 5(h) and Post-Effective
Time Dividends payable in respect of the shares of Ranger Class A Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate.
(g) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time (“Post-Effective Time Dividends”) shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the whole Parent Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to
receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Shares shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate
in accordance with this Section 5. Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to
such holder of whole Parent Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the Post-Effective Time Dividends theretofore paid with respect to such
whole Parent Common Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the Post-Effective Time
Dividends with a record date prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all whole Parent Common Shares to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to Post-Effective Time Dividends pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence as if such whole Parent Common Shares were issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.
(h) No Fractional Parent Common Shares. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a
holder of Parent Common Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Shares (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Shares multiplied by (ii) the volume
weighted average price of the Parent Common Shares on the NYSE for the five (5) consecutive trading
days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. Promptly after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such
holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The payment of cash
in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares is not a separately bargained for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off of the fractions in the exchange.
A-111 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(i) Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Ranger,
the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent, each of their respective Affiliates and any
other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Plan of Merger any amount required to be deducted or withheld
under applicable Law (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any deduction or withholding is
required in respect of the delivery of any Parent Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement, the
applicable withholding agent may withhold or deduct from the Cash Consideration and/or a portion of
the Parent Common Shares otherwise deliverable hereunder may be withheld); provided, however, that
except in the case of withholding required under applicable Law in respect of any consideration payable
pursuant to Section 4(d) or Section 5(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends, (i) to the extent any Party
becomes aware of any obligation to deduct or withhold from amounts otherwise payable, issuable or
transferable to or by any Person pursuant to this Agreement, such Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to notify the other relevant Parties as soon as reasonably practicable, and (ii) the
applicable withholding agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Ranger or
applicable recipient in good faith to determine whether such deduction or withholding is required and
shall reasonably cooperate with Ranger or applicable recipient to minimize the amount of any applicable
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are properly deducted or withheld and paid over
to the relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such amounts would have been
paid absent such deduction or withholding, and if withholding is taken in Parent Common Shares, the
relevant withholding agent shall be treated as having sold such Parent Common Shares on behalf of
such Person for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof at the time of such withholding
and paid such cash proceeds to the relevant Taxing Authority.
6. Amendment. Subject to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 27, 2023,
by and between Parent and Ranger (the “Merger Agreement”), this Plan of Merger may be amended by the
boards of directors of Ranger and Merger Sub at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that any amendment made subsequent to the approval of this Plan of Merger by the shareholders of Ranger
and Merger Sub shall not:
(a) alter or change the amount or kind of shares or other securities, eligible interests, obligations,
rights to acquire shares, other securities or eligible interests, cash or other property to be received
under the plan by the shareholders of or owners of eligible interests in Ranger;
(b) alter or change any of the other terms or conditions of this Plan of Merger if the change would
adversely affect such shareholders of Ranger in any material respect; or
(c) alter or change any term of the organizational documents of Ranger or Merger Sub, except as
permitted by Section 13.1-706 of the VSCA.
7. Abandonment. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Merger may be abandoned, subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, without further shareholder action in the manner determined by the boards
of directors of Ranger and Merger Sub. Written notice of such abandonment shall be filed with the SCC prior
to the Effective Time.
8. Defined Terms. As used in this Plan of Merger, the following terms shall have the meaning set forth
below:
