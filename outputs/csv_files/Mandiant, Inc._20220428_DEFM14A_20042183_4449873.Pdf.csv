Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), at the effective time of the merger: (1) Merger
Sub will merge with and into Mandiant; (2) the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) Mandiant
will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving corporation” to refer to Mandiant as the
surviving corporation following the merger.
As a result of the merger, Mandiant will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed,
you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.
The time at which the merger becomes effective (which we refer to as the “effective time of the merger”) will
occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify
in such certificate of merger).",11,11

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger,
each outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares of our common stock that are (1) held by
Mandiant as treasury stock, (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub, (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger or (4) held by stockholders who have neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
nor consented thereto in writing and properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (which shares of our common stock we refer to collectively as the
“excluded shares”)) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $23.00 in cash,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this amount as the “per share price.”
On the closing date of the merger or the first business day following the closing date of the merger, a
sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the aggregate per share
price. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate) or customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry
shares, appropriate letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment agent, the payment agent,
then will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate per share price in exchange for the
shares of our common stock held by that stockholder. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - Payment Agent, Exchange Fund, and Exchange and Payment
Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, each of our stockholders will have the right to receive the per share price for
each share of our common stock that such stockholder owned, as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares,” but will no longer have any rights as
a Mandiant stockholder (except that our stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do
not validly withdraw or otherwise lose, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive payment for the

which is unvested and held by a non-employee director of the Mandiant Board, in each case that is
outstanding as of the effective time of the merger (which we collectively refer to as a “vested
Mandiant restricted stock unit”), will accelerate vesting in full (to the extent not already vested) and
be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (1) the excess of the per share price over the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, of
such vested Mandiant restricted stock unit; and (2) the total number of shares of our common stock
then-subject to such vested Mandiant restricted stock unit. This amount (less any required
withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective
time of the merger.
Each Mandiant restricted stock unit that is unvested as of the effective time of the merger that is held
by an individual who is providing services to Mandiant or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the

and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1)
the excess of the per share price over the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, of such
unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit; and (2) the total number of shares of our common stock
then-subject to such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit. Such cash amount will (1) vest and
become payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) in accordance with the vesting
schedule applicable to the corresponding unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger subject to such holder’s continued service with Parent and its
affiliates through the applicable vesting dates; and (2) be subject to the terms and conditions of any
related agreements containing the payment, vesting conditions and other terms by which such
amount is payable (which we refer to as the “unvested payment plan”).
All other Mandiant restricted stock units not described above that are outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger will be canceled for no consideration.

(including any portion thereof) for which the performance period has been completed at or prior to
the effective time of the merger that is outstanding as of the effective time of the merger (which we

actual achievement of all relevant performance goals (which we refer to as the “completed Mandiant
PSU consideration”), with such completed Mandiant PSU consideration vesting in accordance with
the service-based vesting schedule applicable to such completed Mandiant PSU immediately prior to

full of such Mandiant option. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be

similar to those health and welfare benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
subsidiaries. However, no defined benefit pension, post-retirement medical, equity-based, retention, change-
in-control, severance or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits provided to continuing
employees prior to the effective time of the merger will be taken into account for the foregoing.
Continuing employees generally will receive credit for all service with us and our subsidiaries prior to the
effective time of the merger and with Parent, the surviving corporation, and any of their subsidiaries on or
after the effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to
benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay

For our executive officers, the treatment of their outstanding equity-based awards of Mandiant
restricted stock units, Mandiant PSUs and Mandiant options, and outstanding rights to purchase

lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger
under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that these stockholders will be entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of their
shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to
be the fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate
of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment,
compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the
surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will
accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash
payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who
wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of
their shares.
Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder
of record must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Mandiant before the vote is taken on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through
the effective time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal
rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in
the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in
respect of Mandiant unless certain conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal, as
described further below. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are
described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262
of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is attached as

extensions thereof, if any) applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”) has expired or otherwise been terminated.
On April 20, 2022, Mandiant and Parent each received a request for additional information and documentary
material (which we refer to as a “Second Request”) from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(which we refer to as the “DOJ”) in connection with the DOJ’s review of the merger. The issuance of the
Second Request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both Mandiant and Parent
have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the
DOJ or extended by agreement of Mandiant and Parent.
The merger is also subject to clearances, consents, approvals and the waiting periods applicable to the
merger under certain foreign antitrust laws and foreign investment (which we refer to as “FDI”) laws.
Antitrust and FDI approvals of the merger are required in various jurisdictions throughout Europe, the
Middle East and Asia.",18,18
"Mandiant, Inc._20220428_DEFM14A_20042183_4449873.Pdf",Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the merger agreement are not conditioned on the receipt or
availability of any funds, or subject to any financing condition. Parent intends to finance the transaction
using its cash on hand and has represented to us in the merger agreement that it has sufficient cash
resources to pay the aggregate merger consideration.
Mandiant also has outstanding $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.875% convertible senior
notes due 2024 (which we refer to as the “2024 Notes”), $23.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.000%
convertible Series A senior notes due 2035 (which we refer to as the “Series A 2035 Notes”) and $460 million
in aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible Series B senior notes due 2035 (which we refer to as the
“Series B 2035 Notes,” and, together with the 2024 Notes and Series A 2035 Notes, the “Convertible Notes”).
On the closing date of the merger, each series of Convertible Notes will be convertible into the merger
consideration at the then applicable conversion rate for the relevant series of Convertible Notes. Mandiant
will be required to make an offer to repurchase each series of Convertible Notes at 100 percent of their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable fundamental change
repurchase date (as defined in the applicable convertible notes indenture). The Series A 2035 Notes are also
redeemable at the option of Mandiant, and after June 1, 2022, the Series B 2035 Notes will be redeemable at
the option of Mandiant, in each case at 100 percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (as defined in the applicable convertible
notes indenture). Under the merger agreement, Mandiant has agreed to cooperate with Parent in the event
that Parent seeks to launch a tender offer with respect to any or all of the Convertible Notes. In connection
with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, Mandiant entered into capped call transactions (which we refer to as the
“capped call transactions”) with certain financial institutions (which we refer to as the “option
counterparties”). The capped call transactions were expected by Mandiant to reduce the potential dilution to
Mandiant’s common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or to offset any cash payments that
Mandiant would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted 2024 Notes, as the
case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap set forth in the capped call transactions. In
order to hedge the risks of the option counterparties under or in respect of the capped call transactions, the
option counterparties or their respective affiliates from time to time enter into or unwind various derivative
transactions with respect to Mandiant’s common stock and/or purchase or sell Mandiant’s common stock or
other securities issued by Mandiant in secondary market transactions.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, Parent has the right to direct Mandiant to effect an early termination and
cash settlement of all obligations in respect of the capped call transactions. Pursuant to the merger
agreement, Mandiant has agreed that, except as directed by Parent, Mandiant will not exercise any option

In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on March 7, 2022, following the Mandiant Board’s
approval thereof, Mandiant’s convertible preferred stockholders, Blackstone Delta Lower Holdings DE L.P.
and, BTO FD Delta Holdings DE L.P. (which we refer to as “Blackstone”), ClearSky Security Fund I LLC and
ClearSky Power & Technology Fund II LLC (which we refer to as “ClearSky”), and Mr. Mandia, in each case
in their capacities as stockholders of Mandiant, entered into voting agreements (which we refer to as the
“voting agreements”) with Parent and Mandiant. The voting agreements obligate (A) the applicable
stockholders to vote their respective shares of our common stock and convertible preferred stock (1) in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby and by
the other transaction documents, including the merger, (2) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone
such meeting of Mandiant’s stockholders to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement, (3) against any action or proposal in favor of an acquisition proposal, without regard to the terms
of such acquisition proposal, and (4) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would
reasonably be likely to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and (B) in the case of the convertible preferred stockholders, the
applicable convertible preferred stockholders to take all steps necessary to convert all of their shares of
Mandiant’s convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock, including delivering to Mandiant a
conversion notice in respect of their convertible preferred stock concurrently with the execution and delivery
of the voting agreements, prior to the effective time of the merger and, in the case of Blackstone, prior to any
exercise of remedies by their lenders with respect to such shares, if earlier. The voting agreements terminate
upon the earliest to occur of (1) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; (2) the
effective time of the merger; or (3) the entry into any amendment or modification to, or waiver of Mandiant’s
rights under, the merger agreement that (a) results in a decrease in, change in the composition of, or
otherwise adversely affects the merger consideration, (b) extends the termination date (except as
contemplated by the merger agreement) or (c) modifies in any material respect Article II or Article VII of the
merger agreement in a manner that is adverse to Mandiant’s stockholders without the prior written consent
of the stockholders party to the voting agreements.
As of the record date, the voting agreements cover approximately 11.8 percent of our common stock (on an
as-converted to common stock basis and excluding shares of our common stock issuable upon vesting of
Mandiant restricted stock units and Mandiant PSUs) in the aggregate. For more information, please see the

that (1) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or would be reasonably likely to
lead to a superior proposal; and (2) the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. From the date of the merger agreement to
the effective time of the merger (or, if earlier, the termination of the merger agreement), Mandiant has agreed
that it will prior to or contemporaneously make available to Parent and its representatives any non-public

captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Why am I receiving these materials?
On March 7, 2022, we announced that Mandiant entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger
agreement, Parent will acquire Mandiant for $23.00 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to
complete the merger, our stockholders representing a majority of all issued and outstanding common
stock and convertible preferred stock, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis, must vote to
adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This approval is a condition to the consummation of
the merger. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to
the Closing of the Merger.” The Mandiant Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy
card to the holders of shares of our common stock and convertible preferred stock in connection with
the solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special meeting.
This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger,
the merger agreement, the special meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The
enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock without
attending the special meeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and
voted at the special meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit
a proxy as soon as possible.
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Mandiant?
The proposed merger is the acquisition of Mandiant by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement is approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger
agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Mandiant, with Mandiant
continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Mandiant will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted
from the Nasdaq. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we
will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $23.00 in cash, without interest and less
any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own, unless you have
properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the
DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of
our common stock, you will receive $2,300.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
How does the per share price compare to the market price of Mandiant’s common stock?
This amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 53 percent to the closing price of our common
stock on February 7, 2022, which was the last full trading day before media reports that Mandiant was
pursuing a sale; and (2) a premium of approximately 57 percent to Mandiant’s unaffected 10-day volume
weighted average price as of February 7, 2022.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What will happen to Mandiant equity-based awards and Mandiant options?
Generally speaking, Mandiant equity-based awards and Mandiant options will be treated as follows:
Each vested Mandiant restricted stock unit will accelerate vesting in full (to the extent not already
vested) and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (1) the excess of the per share price over the exercise or purchase price per
share, if any, of such vested Mandiant restricted stock unit; and (2) the total number of shares of our
common stock then-subject to such vested Mandiant restricted stock unit. This amount (less any
required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the
effective time of the merger.
Each unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess of the per share price over
the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, of such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit; and
(2) the total number of shares of our common stock then-subject to such unvested Mandiant
restricted stock unit. Such cash amount will (1) vest and become payable (less any required
withholding and other taxes) in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding
unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, subject
to such holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates;
and (2) be subject to the terms and conditions of the unvested payment plan.
All other Mandiant restricted stock units not described above that are outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger will be canceled for no consideration.
Each completed Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the completed Mandiant PSU consideration, with such completed
Mandiant PSU consideration vesting in accordance with the service-based vesting schedule
applicable to such completed Mandiant PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and
subject to the terms of the unvested payment plan.
At the effective time of the merger, each uncompleted Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted
into a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the uncompleted Mandiant PSU
consideration with such uncompleted Mandiant PSU consideration vesting in accordance with the
service-based vesting schedule applicable to such uncompleted Mandiant PSU immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger and subject to the terms of the unvested payment plan.
Each Mandiant option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will accelerate vesting in full and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share
price over the exercise price per share of such Mandiant option, and (2) the number of shares of our
common stock then issuable upon exercise in full of such Mandiant option. This amount (less any
required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the
effective time of the merger.
Any Mandiant option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share that is equal to or
greater than the per share price will be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.
What will happen to the ESPP?
Generally speaking, the ESPP will be treated as follows:
No further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP following the
closing date of the merger. The ESPP will be terminated immediately prior to and effective as of the
effective time of the merger (subject to consummation of the merger).
Any offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the
effective time of the merger will be terminated no later than ten (10) business days prior to the
effective time of the merger.

We will apply any funds within each ESPP participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares of
our common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. These shares will be deposited into the

of common stock in connection with the consummation of the merger. Any amounts not used for the
purchase of shares of our common stock will be refunded.

Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
All of our stockholders as of the close of business on April 6, 2022, which is the record date for the
special meeting, are entitled to vote their shares of our common stock at the special meeting. As of the
close of business on the record date, there were 233,978,294 shares of our common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of our common stock outstanding as of the
record

date is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting. Each
share of our convertible preferred stock outstanding as of the record date is entitled to one vote per
share of common stock, on an as-converted-into-common-stock basis, on each matter properly brought
before the special meeting.
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock and convertible
preferred stock, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis, outstanding as of the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the
internet or by telephone; or (3) vote at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the
failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation
that will or may become payable to Mandiant’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (2)
the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting?
Approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or
may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person
or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the
internet or by telephone; or (3) vote at the special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to
approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the special meeting, except to the extent that such failure affects
obtaining a quorum at the meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on these proposals,
except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at the meeting. In all cases, abstentions
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals.
What do I need to do now?
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents
that we refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Then, even if
you expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the
enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience), or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card), so that
your shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer
to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee for information on how
to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
How does the Mandiant Board recommend that I vote?
The Mandiant Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive
officers

in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or
dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock.
Instead: (1) Mandiant will remain an independent public company; (2) our common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue
to file periodic reports with the SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Mandiant has agreed to pay
Parent (or its designee) a termination fee. In other specified circumstances in which the merger
agreement is terminated, Parent has agreed to pay Mandiant a termination fee.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - 
Termination Fees and Remedies.”
What is the compensation that will or may become payable to Mandiant’s named executive officers in connection
with the merger?
The compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of
Mandiant’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying employee benefit plans and arrangements
that are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent or its affiliates
(including, following the consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation) to our named
executive officers pursuant to arrangements entered into between Parent and our named executive
officers in connection with or following the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 2: Approval, on a Non-Binding,
Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation.”
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable to Mandiant’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger?
Mandiant is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or
may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of the
compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger is not required to consummate the merger.
What will happen if Mandiant’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable to
Mandiant’s named executive officers in connection with the merger?
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger is not a condition to consummation of the merger. This is an advisory vote
and will not be binding on Mandiant or Parent. The underlying plans and arrangements providing for
such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated,
the compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger will or may be paid to Mandiant’s named executive officers even if our stockholders do not
approve such compensation.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, AST, you are considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a stockholder of record, this
proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf of Mandiant. As

TABLE OF CONTENTS
a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares at the special meeting
using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial
owner” of shares of our common stock held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of
our common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank,
broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of
record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special
meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the
special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you
the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently
scheduled to be considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of
obtaining a quorum or voted on the proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
“AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve, on a
non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger or the adjournment proposal, except to the extent affecting the
obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.
How may I vote?
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your
name with AST, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for
your convenience);
by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
by attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the
enclosed proxy card.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to
vote your shares of our common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly
recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is no charge for
voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs
such as internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our
common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote
shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of our common stock at the special
meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the
special meeting, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through
your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone
through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting
instruction form provided by your bank, broker or nominee. However, because you are not the
stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special
meeting.

over large gatherings of people and in order to help limit potential transmission of COVID-19.
Furthermore, our experience with virtual meetings demonstrated that the goals of accessibility and
stockholder participation can be well served by the virtual format.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our
common stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the
special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your
shares of our common stock is called a “proxy card.” You may follow the instructions on the proxy card
to designate a proxy by telephone or by the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and
returned a proxy card. Kevin R. Mandia, Frank E. Verdecanna and Richard B. Meamber, each with full
powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy holders for the special meeting.
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time
before it is voted at the special meeting by:
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the
enclosed proxy card.
If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or
other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the special
meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to
vote your shares at the special meeting.
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy
card will vote your shares in the way that you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be
voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended
by the Mandiant Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) “FOR” the
adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special
meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
No. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of
transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order
to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented by your stock
certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your
stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock
certificates with your proxy card. If you hold your shares of our common stock in book-entry form, you
will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead the payment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of
the merger consideration upon receipt of a customary “agent’s message” and any other items specified
by the payment agent.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special
meeting?
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected
effective date of the merger. If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date
but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made
between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies
Mandiant in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share
price with respect to such shares, if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer
your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or
transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the
enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically
over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card).
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for)
each proxy card and voting instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement
and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held
in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account,
you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold
shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting materials that you receive.
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
If available, Mandiant may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting.
Mandiant intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the
SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Mandiant files with the SEC are publicly available
when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?
If you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-
U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax
unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a
valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to
determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular
circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any
state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and
does not constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
We currently expect to complete the merger in 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the
merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in
the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and
any extensions thereof, if any) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has expired or been
terminated.
On April 20, 2022, Mandiant and Parent each received a Second Request from the DOJ in connection
with the DOJ’s review of the merger. The issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period
under the HSR Act until 30 days after both Mandiant and Parent have substantially complied with the
Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ or extended by agreement of
Mandiant and Parent.
The merger is also subject to clearances, consents, approvals and the waiting periods applicable to the
merger under certain foreign antitrust laws and FDI laws. Antitrust and FDI approvals of the merger are
required in various jurisdictions throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. As of the date of this
proxy statement, Mandiant and Parent have determined to make antitrust notifications in Saudi Arabia,
Israel, Taiwan and Turkey, and may make notifications in other jurisdictions.
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their shares of our common stock through the effective time of
the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory
requirements as described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise
lose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the
merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their
shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value”
of their shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for
good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair
value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five
percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking
appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and
(2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders who
wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to
the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements
for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, which
description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement.
Do any of Mandiant’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Mandiant
stockholders generally?
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Mandiant Board with respect to the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests
in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. In: (1)
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger;
and (3) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included
in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-
looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts, including, without limitation,
statements relating to the completion of the merger. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by
the use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,”
“expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecast” and other words of similar import. Our
stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance
and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in
the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks
detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and
matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following factors:
the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of our stockholders to adopt the merger
agreement or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger, including that
a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary regulatory approval;
the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay a
termination fee;
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the
merger agreement;
risks that the merger affects our current operations or our ability to retain or recruit employees;
the fact that receipt of the all-cash per share price will be taxable to our stockholders that are treated
as U.S. Holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
the fact that, if the merger is completed, our stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the
potential long-term value of the successful execution of Mandiant’s current strategy as an
independent company;
the possibility that Mandiant could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including
restructuring efforts, special dividends or the sale of some or all of Mandiant’s assets to one or more

period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment,

subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Mandiant operates and adverse
economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not
to be completed, the price of our common stock may decline significantly.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future
value of your shares of our common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Mandiant Board will continue
to evaluate and review, among other things, Mandiant’s business, operations, strategic direction and
capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted
by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Mandiant’s business, prospects
or results of operation may be adversely impacted.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Mandiant has agreed to pay Parent
(or its designee) the applicable termination fee. In other specified circumstances in which the merger
agreement is terminated, Parent has agreed to pay Mandiant a termination fee.",45,45

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger:
each outstanding share of our common stock that is (1) held by Mandiant as treasury stock; (2)
owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor;
each outstanding share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger (other than the shares identified in the prior bullet and shares of
our common stock held by our stockholders who have (1) neither voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing; and (2) properly and validly exercised their
statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares in accordance with the DGCL) will be cancelled
and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
per share price, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes; and
each certificate formerly representing any shares of our common stock or any book-entry shares that
represented shares of our common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
automatically be cancelled and retired and all such shares will cease to exist and will thereafter only
represent the right to receive the per share price, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes.
On the closing date of the merger or the first business day following the closing date of the merger, a
sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the aggregate per share
price. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate) or customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry
shares, appropriate letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment agent, then the payment
agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate per share price in exchange for
shares of our common stock held by the stockholder. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment
Procedures.”

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger
agreement. This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Mandiant
Board, the Transaction Committee (as defined below), our representatives, or other parties.
The Mandiant Board regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view
toward strengthening our business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the
Mandiant Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included,
among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with
Mandiant remaining an independent entity; (2) the investment in, and development of, new products and
services; (3) capital raising activities; (4) potential expansion opportunities through partnerships or other
commercial relationships; and (5) business combinations, acquisitions, dispositions and other financial and
strategic alternatives.
In 2019, the Mandiant Board explored potential strategic alternatives available to our company, with a focus
on a potential divestiture of our network, email, endpoint and cloud security products and the related
security management and orchestration platform (which we refer to as the “FireEye Products business”). We
retained Goldman Sachs to provide us with financial advisory services in this process. Goldman Sachs was
well known to the Mandiant Board given Goldman Sachs’ qualifications, extensive expertise, international
reputation, knowledge of our industry and experience in advising companies in connection with potential
strategic transactions. The Mandiant Board ultimately determined not to pursue a strategic transaction at
that time. As a result of this process, however, the Mandiant Board determined that the divestiture of the
FireEye Products business was a potentially attractive alternative that could enhance long-term stockholder
value. Our engagement of Goldman Sachs was not terminated following this decision, and Goldman Sachs
continued to advise us from time to time.
On November 19, 2020, we announced a $400 million strategic investment in us by Blackstone and ClearSky.
We used the proceeds of this investment, which closed on December 11, 2020, to support strategic growth
initiatives. Following this investment, we leveraged Blackstone’s expertise as affiliates of a leading financial
institution to support the transformation of our business.
In early 2021, we began, with the assistance of Goldman Sachs, to actively explore the sale of the FireEye
Products business as a potential means of enhancing long-term stockholder value. To assist in this process
(as well as any decision by the Mandiant Board to explore strategic alternatives for the entire company), on
March 4, 2021, the Mandiant Board established a transaction committee (which we refer to as the
“Transaction Committee”). The Mandiant Board formed the Transaction Committee in light of (1) the
potentially significant workload that could be involved in any decision by Mandiant to sell the FireEye
Products business or to consider other strategic alternatives; (2) the possibility that Mandiant management
may need feedback and direction on relatively short notice; and (3) the benefits and convenience of having a
subset of directors oversee and direct the process of considering strategic alternatives. The Mandiant Board
authorized the Transaction Committee to, among other things, (1) consider, analyze and evaluate strategic
alternatives available to the company; (2) approach potential strategic and financial acquirers regarding
strategic alternatives, and to negotiate with such parties; (3) oversee and provide assistance to Mandiant
management and our advisers with respect to the consideration, analysis and evaluation of any strategic
alternative; (4) take all other actions that the Transaction Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or
desirable; and (5) recommend to the Mandiant Board what action, if any, should be taken with respect to any
strategic alternative. The Mandiant Board retained the power and authority to approve the final decision on
pursuing a strategic alternative. It was also understood that the Mandiant Board would
37 TABLE OF CONTENTS
continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic alternatives. The Mandiant Board appointed
Kimberly Alexy, Viral Patel and Enrique Salem as the members of the Transaction Committee. The Mandiant
Board did not provide for the payment of any compensation to the members of the Transaction Committee in
consideration of their service on the committee (other than their compensation as members of the Mandiant
Board).
On June 2, 2021, we announced our intention to sell the FireEye Products business to affiliates of Symphony
Technology Group. We refer to this transaction as the “FireEye Divestiture.”
During June 2021 and July 2021, Kevin Mandia, our chief executive officer, spoke, on an individual basis,
with members of the Mandiant Board about the possibility and advisability of exploring other strategic
alternatives for Mandiant following the completion of the FireEye Divestiture, including a possible sale of
Mandiant. The members of the Mandiant Board expressed support for Mr. Mandia having introductory
conversations with a limited number of strategic and financial acquirers who were most likely to have an
interest in an acquisition of us. Mr. Mandia subsequently engaged in these discussions. Due to Mr. Mandia
and other members of Mandiant management being focused on executing the FireEye Divestiture, these
discussions did not advance beyond the introductory stage until late September 2021.
On September 22, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with members of management of a potential strategic acquirer
(which we refer to as “Strategic A”) concerning Strategic A’s possible interest in considering an acquisition
of us.
On October 4, 2021, in connection with the pending FireEye Divestiture, our company was renamed
Mandiant.
On October 8, 2021, we completed the FireEye Divestiture, at which time our business became focused
entirely on our controls-agnostic cybersecurity solutions and services.
On October 11, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with representatives of a potential financial
acquirer (which we refer to as “Financial A”) concerning Financial A’s possible interest in considering an
acquisition of us. This meeting occurred at Financial A’s request.
Also on October 11, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a member of management of a potential strategic acquirer
(which we refer to as “Strategic B”) concerning Strategic B’s possible interest in considering an acquisition
of us.
On October 19, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with members of management of Strategic B concerning Strategic B’s
possible interest in considering an acquisition of us.

(which we refer to as “Strategic C”) concerning Strategic C’s possible interest in considering an acquisition
of us.
Also on November 17, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with members of management of
Strategic A concerning our business and prospects.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In mid-November 2021, it was determined that sufficient interest in an acquisition of us had been expressed
to warrant the involvement of Goldman Sachs to assist the Mandiant Board in considering strategic
alternatives for Mandiant.
On December 7, 2021, members of the Mandiant Board and members of Mandiant management met informally
with representatives of Goldman Sachs. During this meeting, the representatives of Goldman Sachs provided
their perspective on market conditions and mergers and acquisitions activity in the cybersecurity and
technology space, and also discussed Goldman Sachs’ preliminary views on our stock price performance and
compared it to certain other companies and the broader market. The representatives of Goldman Sachs
discussed strategic alternatives available to Mandiant, including (1) the continuation of our current business
plan with Mandiant remaining as an independent company; and (2) a sale of Mandiant. As part of this
discussion, the representatives of Goldman Sachs provided Goldman Sachs’ preliminary view, in its judgment
and experience, as to the most likely potential strategic and financial acquirers of Mandiant based on, among
other things, Goldman Sachs’ assessment of (1) the strategic fit of Mandiant with each potential acquirer;
and (2) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an acquisition of
us. After considering our near- and long-term prospects as an independent company, it was the consensus
of the members of the Mandiant Board participating in the discussion that (1) a sale of Mandiant in the near
term could be in the best interests of Mandiant and our stockholders; (2) a more formalized review of our
strategic alternatives should commence; (3) it was appropriate to use a targeted, private process focused on
the potential strategic and financial acquirers most likely to have an interest in acquiring us; (4) Goldman
Sachs should make initial or renewed contact with the most likely potential strategic acquirers (including
Parent, Strategic A, Strategic B and Strategic C) and financial acquirers (including Financial A) regarding
their interest in an acquisition of us; (5) depending on the outcome of these contacts by Goldman Sachs, it
would be appropriate for Mandiant management to proceed with more in-depth discussions with these
parties concerning a possible acquisition of us; and (6) the Transaction Committee should oversee this
process.
Following the December 7, 2021 meeting, we began a more formalized process of reviewing strategic
alternatives. During this process, Goldman Sachs, as directed and on our behalf, ultimately contacted seven
potential strategic acquirers and five potential financial acquirers regarding their interest in considering an
acquisition of us. In support of the process, representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed Mandiant from
time to time with potential strategic and financial acquirers in order to better understand their interest in an
acquisition of us. We also entered into, or were already a party to, confidentiality agreements with all seven
potential strategic acquirers and four of the potential financial acquirers. Certain of these confidentiality
agreements contained a “standstill” provision; none of these confidentiality agreements prohibited the
counterparty from making a public or private proposal to acquire all of our common stock. Two of the seven
potential strategic acquirers (one of which was Strategic C) and one of the potential financial acquirers did
not pursue any further engagement in respect of an acquisition of us.
On December 8, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a senior executive of Financial A concerning Financial A’s
interest in a possible acquisition of us.
On December 15, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with members of management of Strategic A to
discuss general due diligence matters.

our company to Strategic B.

among other things, the process for preparing the preliminary financial projections, including the underlying
assumptions and various execution and other risks to realizing the forecasted results. (The term Projected
Financial Information is defined in, and further information about the substance of the Projected Financial
Information is contained in, the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Projected Financial
Information.”) The Mandiant Board approved these preliminary financial projections and authorized

On February 16, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with members of the Mandiant Board and members of
Mandiant management in attendance. Members of Mandiant management provided a general update on the
status of discussions with Parent, Strategic A and Strategic B, noting that each continued to consider an
acquisition. Members of Mandiant management reviewed with the Mandiant Board a draft of the Projected
Financial Information for the period of 2022 to 2035 and described, among other things, the process for

On February 20, 2022, a senior executive of Strategic A spoke with representatives of Goldman Sachs and
expressed interest in continuing to review information regarding Mandiant. The representatives of Goldman
Sachs informed the senior executive of Strategic A that all parties in the process had been provided with
generally consistent levels of information at that point and encouraged the senior executive of Strategic A to
speak with Mr. Mandia that day to the extent that such discussion would be helpful to Strategic A. The
representatives of Goldman Sachs further suggested that if Strategic A were interested in acquiring
Mandiant, then Strategic A should submit a written acquisition proposal by the bid deadline on February 21,
2022, given the possibility that the Mandiant Board could decide at that point not to engage further with
parties who had not submitted a written proposal. The senior executive of Strategic A acknowledged this
suggestion and expressed interest in speaking further with Mr. Mandia.
Later on February 20, 2022, the senior executive of Strategic A spoke to Mr. Mandia and representatives of
Goldman Sachs. The representatives of Goldman Sachs reiterated the importance of Strategic A submitting a
written acquisition proposal by the bid deadline of February 21, 2022, if Strategic A were interested in a
potential acquisition, given the possibility that the Mandiant Board could determine not to engage further
with parties who had not submitted a timely written proposal. The senior executive of Strategic A again
acknowledged this suggestion.
Also on February 20, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,
members of Mandiant management and representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives
of Goldman Sachs provided the Transaction Committee, for the information of the Transaction Committee and
the Mandiant Board, materials that summarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the
announcement and of the consummation of an acquisition of us on the capped call transactions that we had
entered into with Goldman Sachs and other counterparties, each acting as principal for its own account, with
respect to our convertible notes, as well as the relationship disclosures previously provided by Goldman
Sachs. The Transaction Committee did not identify any concerns with these disclosures. The representatives
of Goldman Sachs reviewed Goldman Sachs’ preliminary financial analyses of Mandiant. The Transaction
Committee discussed next steps if we were to receive an acquisition proposal.
On February 21, 2022, Mr. Mandia spoke with a senior executive of Parent. During this discussion, the senior
executive of Parent stated that Parent would be submitting a non-binding written proposal to acquire us.
43 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on February 21, 2022, Parent submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire us for $22.00 in cash
per share of our common stock. Parent also requested that we agree to negotiate exclusively with Parent
through March 19, 2022.
Also on February 21, 2022, a senior executive of Strategic A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that,
although Strategic A would not be submitting an acquisition proposal on that date, it remained interested in
considering an acquisition of us.
On February 22, 2022, representatives of Strategic B informed Mr. Mandia that Strategic B was no longer
considering an acquisition of us.
Later on February 22, 2022, the Mandiant Board met, with members of Mandiant management and
representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The results of the strategic
review process overseen by Goldman Sachs were noted, including that only Parent and Strategic A were still
considering an acquisition of us in any respect. The terms of the acquisition proposal submitted by Parent
(including the request to negotiate on an exclusive basis), and the recent communication from Strategic A,
were discussed. The Mandiant Board noted (1) the significant due diligence already undertaken by Parent;
(2) Parent’s desire to proceed quickly toward announcement of an acquisition; (3) the more limited due
diligence that had been undertaken by Strategic A as compared to Parent; (4) Strategic A’s failure to provide
a written acquisition proposal by the bid deadline of February 21, 2022; (5) the possibility that Parent would
withdraw its acquisition proposal if it was not promptly accepted by Mandiant; and (6) the perceived level of
strategic fit, as well as regulatory considerations and deal certainty, with respect to Parent compared to
Strategic A. Given these considerations, the Mandiant Board determined that it wished to continue to work
toward a transaction with Parent. The Mandiant Board instructed Goldman Sachs to make a counterproposal
to Parent for an acquisition of us for $24.00 in cash per share of our common stock, with an exclusive
negotiation period ending on March 9, 2022. The Mandiant Board also requested a conversation between
Enrique Salem, our chairman of the board, Mr. Mandia and Sundar Pichai, Parent’s chief executive officer, to
discuss Parent’s institutional commitment to the acquisition. Mr. Mandia confirmed to the Mandiant Board
that neither he nor any member of Mandiant management had engaged in discussions with Parent regarding
any post-acquisition employment terms with Parent. The Mandiant Board also authorized the Transaction
Committee to oversee negotiations with Parent and, if it determined appropriate, to authorize us to enter into
an exclusivity agreement with Parent.
Following the meeting of the Mandiant Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed members of
management of Parent of the counterproposal from the Mandiant Board. Later, in a subsequent conversation
with representatives of Goldman Sachs, Parent agreed to increase its acquisition proposal to $23.00 in cash
per share of our common stock and to shorten the exclusivity period to end at 6:00 a.m., Pacific time, on
March 10, 2022. Parent also agreed to arrange the requested call between Messrs. Salem, Mandia and Pichai.
Later on February 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,
members of Mandiant management and representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance. The Transaction
Committee discussed the terms of the latest acquisition proposal from Parent and agreed to meet again when
Parent provided its revised proposal in writing and its updated exclusivity agreement.
Following the meeting of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs received multiple
calls from a senior executive of Strategic A. In these calls, the senior executive of Strategic A (1) stated that
Strategic A remained interested in considering an acquisition of us; and (2) requested assistance in thinking
about an appropriate price for an acquisition. The representatives of Goldman Sachs declined to provide
such assistance, but stated that they would convey Strategic A’s interest to Mandiant.
Later on February 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,
members of Mandiant management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. A representative of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Transaction Committee
their fiduciary duties. It was noted that the requested call between Messrs. Salem, Mandia and Pichai had
been arranged and would be occurring shortly. The representatives of Goldman Sachs described their recent
discussions with a senior executive of Strategic A. The Transaction Committee noted the same factors
regarding Parent and Strategic A that were noted in the meeting of the Mandiant Board earlier

in the day. The Transaction Committee directed Goldman Sachs to inform Strategic A that it should submit a
written acquisition proposal not later than that evening, and that the per share price in any such proposal
should reflect a premium of well above 50 percent over our stock price prior to speculation that we were
pursuing a sale process. Such a premium would imply a price of well above $22.59 per share of our common
stock, although representatives of Goldman Sachs did not provide this number to Strategic A. Messrs.
Mandia and Salem then departed the meeting to speak with Mr. Pichai.
Following the meeting of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed a senior
executive of Strategic A as instructed by the Transaction Committee. The senior executive of Strategic A
informed the representatives of Goldman Sachs that Strategic A would further consider an acquisition of us
and would respond that evening.
Still later on February 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,
members of Mandiant management and representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance. The terms of
Parent’s acquisition proposal at $23.00 in cash per share of our common stock (which by this time had been
put in writing), including the updated exclusivity agreement, were discussed. Messrs. Salem and Mandia
discussed their conversation with Mr. Pichai and noted their satisfaction with the level of institutional
commitment to the acquisition expressed by Mr. Pichai. The representatives of Goldman Sachs departed the
meeting to take a call from the senior executive of Strategic A. During this call, the senior executive of
Strategic A stated that Strategic A was unable to submit an acquisition proposal that evening. The
representatives of Goldman Sachs rejoined the meeting and informed the Transaction Committee of the
conversation with Strategic A. The Transaction Committee determined to move forward with the acquisition
proposal from Parent and to agree to negotiate with Parent on an exclusive basis through 6:00 a.m., Pacific
time, on March 10, 2022. Parent and Mandiant subsequently entered into an exclusivity agreement.
Beginning on February 23, 2022, Parent and its advisors were granted access to legal and operational due
diligence documents and information in an electronic data room to support their due diligence review of
Mandiant. Over the following days, members of management of Parent and representatives of Parent’s
advisors conducted operational, legal, financial, accounting, employment and other due diligence on
Mandiant. At various points, members of management of Parent and representatives of Parent’s advisors met
with Mandiant management and our advisors regarding due diligence information, potential synergies,
employee retention and related matters.
On February 23, 2022, a draft of the merger agreement was provided to Parent and its legal advisors at
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (which we refer to as “Freshfields”). Over the following two weeks,
Mandiant management and Parent management, and representatives of their respective legal advisors,
negotiated the terms of the merger agreement. Key terms of the merger agreement negotiated by the parties
included (1) the nature and scope of Parent’s obligations to secure necessary regulatory approvals for the
acquisition; (2) the amount of the termination fee payable by each party and the circumstances in which it
would be payable; (3) whether Mandiant was obligated to pay Parent a termination fee if our stockholders
did not approve the merger; (4) the definition of “material adverse effect”; (5) the conditions to each party’s
obligation to consummate the merger; and (6) the nature and scope of the interim operating covenants
applicable to Mandiant during the period prior to the closing of the merger.
On February 27, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board, members
of Mandiant management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.
A representative of Wilson Sonsini summarized the material terms of the merger agreement and the points
that were under negotiation.
Also on February 27, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs received a call from a senior executive of
Strategic A seeking an update on any sale process involving Mandiant. The representatives of Goldman
Sachs, in compliance with the exclusivity agreement then in effect, declined to give such an update at such
time.
On February 28, 2022, Freshfields provided a draft of the form of the voting agreements to representatives of
Wilson Sonsini. Over the following days, representatives of Mr. Mandia, Blackstone, ClearSky, Mandiant
and Parent negotiated the terms of the voting agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On March 2, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board, members of
Mandiant management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Baker Botts LLP
(which we refer to as “Baker Botts”), outside antitrust counsel to Mandiant, in attendance. The material
terms of the merger agreement and the points that remained under negotiation were discussed, along with
the nature of the regulatory approvals needed for the merger.
On March 6, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board, members of
Mandiant management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The
material terms of the merger agreement and the points that remained under negotiation were discussed; it
was noted that the material economic and valuation terms had been agreed in principle. In response to a
specific request from Parent, the Transaction Committee authorized Mr. Mandia (and only Mr. Mandia) to
begin discussions with Parent concerning the terms of his employment with Parent following the merger.
Later on March 6, 2022, Freshfields provided a draft of Mr. Mandia’s non-competition agreement to Wilson
Sonsini, which agreement was then shared with Mr. Mandia and his counsel.
On March 7, 2022, Mr. Mandia received a draft employment offer from Parent.
Later on March 7, 2022, The Information published an article stating that Parent was in talks to acquire us.
Still later on March 7, 2022 the Mandiant Board met, with members of Mandiant management and
representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Baker Botts in attendance. A representative
of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the Mandiant Board their fiduciary duties. A representative of Wilson
Sonsini also reviewed the principal terms of the merger agreement, the voting agreements and the other
transaction documents. A representative of Baker Botts discussed the terms of the merger agreement related
to antitrust and competition law matters. Mr. Mandia updated the Mandiant Board on the nature of the non-
competition obligations that Parent was requiring of him, and noted that negotiations with Parent were
continuing with respect to the terms of his employment following the merger. The representatives of
Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Mandiant Board Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses of the consideration to
be paid to stockholders in connection with the merger. The representatives of Goldman Sachs then rendered
the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated March 7,
2022, to the Mandiant Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the
factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $23.00 in cash per share of our common stock to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of such shares.
Still later on March 7, 2022, the merger agreement, voting agreements and other transaction documents were
finalized.
Even later on March 7, 2022, the Mandiant Board met, with members of Mandiant management and
representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Baker Botts in attendance. A representative
of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the terms of the final merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction
documents with the Mandiant Board. The representatives of Goldman Sachs confirmed the oral opinion of
Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 7, 2022, to the
Mandiant Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the $23.00 in cash per share of our common stock be paid to the holders (other
than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, pursuant to the merger agreement, was fair from
a financial point of view to the holders of such shares. The Mandiant Board, after considering the factors
more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Recommendation of the Mandiant
Board and Reasons for the Merger,”  (1) determined that it was in the best interests of Mandiant and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement providing for the merger in
accordance with the DGCL upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement;
(2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by Mandiant, the performance by Mandiant
of its covenants and other obligations in the merger agreement, and the consummation of the merger upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (3) directed that the adoption of
the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of our stockholders; (4) resolved to recommend

Recommendation of the Mandiant Board
On March 7, 2022, the Mandiant Board unanimously: (1) determined that it was in the best interests of
Mandiant and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement providing for
the merger in accordance with the DGCL upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by Mandiant, the performance
by Mandiant of its covenants and other obligations in the merger agreement, and the consummation of the
merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (3) directed that the
adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of Mandiant’s stockholders at a meeting thereof;
(4) resolved to recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and
the approval of the merger in accordance with the DGCL; and (5) approved the voting agreements and the
transactions contemplated thereby.
The Mandiant Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Mandiant Board consulted with Mandiant
management, as well as representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Baker Botts. In
recommending that Mandiant stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, the Mandiant
Board considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not
necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations and
analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Mandiant Board concluded that entering into the merger
agreement was advisable and in the best interests of Mandiant and our stockholders.
The Mandiant Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination
and recommendation:
Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of Mandiant; Risks of Execution. The
current, historical and projected financial condition, results of operations and business of Mandiant,
as well as Mandiant’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In particular,
the Mandiant Board considered Mandiant’s long-term operating plan (as reflected in the Projected
Financial Information). As part of this, the Mandiant Board considered the potential opportunities
that Mandiant’s long-term operating plan presented against, among other things, various execution
and other risks to achieving the long-term operating plan and related uncertainties, including: (1) the
risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing Mandiant’s current business plan
and long-term operating plan in the short and long term; (2) the impact of market, customer and
competitive trends on Mandiant; and (3) the general risks related to market conditions that could
reduce the price of our common stock. Among the potential risks identified by the Mandiant Board
were:
Mandiant’s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among
these risks were consideration of (1) Mandiant’s size, as well as its financial resources, relative
47 • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to those of its competitors; (2) new and evolving competitive threats; and (3) the substantial
risks to achieving Mandiant’s long-term operating plan.
The difficulty of implementing the various business transformation initiatives currently being
undertaken, and anticipated to be undertaken, by Mandiant, including in respect of efforts to
improve our cost structure. The Mandiant Board noted that these initiatives required sustained
effort on our part and were not certain to result in a more valuable company.
Investments required to implement new systems to further drive Mandiant’s business, including
the need for a new enterprise resource planning system.
The challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly
traded company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance. The Mandiant
Board was aware that the price of our common stock could be negatively impacted if Mandiant
failed to meet investor expectations, including if Mandiant failed to meet its growth objectives.
The historical execution of Mandiant’s business plan by Mandiant management and their ability
to continue to drive Mandiant’s business. In this regard, the Mandiant Board was aware that Mr.
Verdecanna had announced his intention to retire in 2022, and this retirement followed the
departure of other senior executives.
The continued business and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the
possibility that business conditions - for Mandiant and the larger economy - will not improve
and could get worse.
Results of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of an extensive strategic review
process overseen by the Transaction Committee. The Mandiant Board considered that seven
potential strategic acquirers (including Parent) and five potential financial acquirers were contacted
concerning their interest in an acquisition of Mandiant. The Mandiant Board considered the nature of
the engagement by each of these potential acquirers over several weeks, and that only Parent had
submitted an acquisition proposal. The Mandiant Board also was aware of the media reports
regarding a potential sale of Mandiant that began on February 8, 2022, and noted that, following such
media reports, no additional strategic or financial acquirers contacted Mandiant about pursuing an
acquisition.
Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the merger consists
entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business and
financial execution risks of Mandiant’s long-term operating plan. The receipt of cash consideration
eliminates uncertainty and risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of Mandiant’s
business plan. In that regard, the Mandiant Board noted that Mandiant’s stock price could be
negatively impacted if we failed to meet investor expectations.
Best Value Reasonably Available; Potential Strategic Alternatives. The Mandiant Board believed
that the per share merger consideration represents the best value reasonably available for the shares
of our common stock, taking into account the other strategic alternatives available to Mandiant,
including continue to execute on our business plan as an independent company. The Mandiant Board
determined that none of the possible alternatives to the merger (including the possibility of
continuing to operate Mandiant as an independent company or pursuing a different transaction, and
the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to
Mandiant’s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing and likelihood of effecting such
alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us to create greater value for
our stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business, competitive, financial,
industry, legal, market and regulatory risks. The Mandiant Board also considered that the per share
merger consideration constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 53 percent to the closing price of our
common stock on February 7, 2022, which was the last full trading day before media reports regarding
a potential sale of Mandiant; and (2) a premium of approximately 57 percent to Mandiant’s unaffected
10-day volume-weighted average price as of February 7, 2022.
Fairness Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The oral opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Mandiant
Board, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated March 7, 2022, that,

as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and various
assumptions made, procedures followed and limitations and qualifications set forth therein, the $23.00
in cash per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)

Goldman Sachs rendered to the Mandiant Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in its written
opinion dated March 7, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $23.00 in cash per share of our common stock to
be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, pursuant to the
merger agreement, was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of such shares.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 7, 2022, which sets forth assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with
the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion
contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’
written opinion. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and
assistance of the Mandiant Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs
opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of our common stock should vote with respect to the
merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,
Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
the merger agreement;
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Mandiant (formerly FireEye, Inc.)
for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2021;
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Mandiant;
certain other communications from Mandiant to its stockholders;
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Mandiant; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Mandiant (including a schedule of expected net
operating loss carryforwards by Mandiant), prepared by Mandiant management, as approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by Mandiant, which are referred to as “Forecasts.”
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Mandiant regarding their
assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current
business operations, financial condition, and future prospects of Mandiant; reviewed the reported price and
trading activity for our common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for Mandiant
with similar financial and stock market information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software
industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other
factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Mandiant Board’s consent, relied upon and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other
information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for
independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Mandiant Board’s consent
that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and
judgments of the management of Mandiant. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets
and liabilities) of Mandiant or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on
Mandiant or on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs’ analysis.
Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger
agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any
way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Mandiant to engage in the
merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available

TABLE OF CONTENTS
to Mandiant; nor did it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of its opinion, to the holders (other
than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, of the $23.00 in cash per share of our common
stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not
express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger
or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered
into or amended in connection with the merger, including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration
received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other
constituencies of Mandiant; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Mandiant, or class of such persons in connection
with the merger, whether relative to the $23.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent
and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman
Sachs did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of our common stock will trade at any
time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Mandiant or Parent
or the merger, or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of Mandiant or Parent or the
ability of Mandiant or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’
opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the
information made available to it as of the date of its written opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no
responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date of its written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its opinion were
provided for the information and assistance of the Mandiant Board in connection with its consideration of
the merger and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of our
common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was
approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Mandiant
Board in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the
order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman
Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The
tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of
Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the
extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 4, 2022, and is
not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Implied Premia Analysis
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the $23.00 in cash
per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $23.00 in cash per share of our common
stock relative to:
$15.06, the undisturbed closing price for our common stock on February 7, 2022, the last trading day
prior to media reports regarding a potential sale of Mandiant (the “Undisturbed Share Price”);
the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as “VWAP”) of our common stock over the 5-
trading-day time period ended February 7, 2022 (which we refer to as “5-day Undisturbed VWAP”);
the VWAP of our common stock over the 10-trading-day time period ended February 7, 2022 (“10-day
Undisturbed VWAP”); and
$19.38, the closing price for our common stock on March 4, 2022, the last trading day prior to further
media reports regarding the merger (which we refer to as the “Current Share Price”).

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Mandiant to
derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Company Stock. Using discount rates ranging from
9.25 percent to 11.25 percent, reflecting estimates of Mandiant’s weighted average cost of capital, and the
mid-year convention, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2021 (1) the estimates
of unlevered free cash flow (“UFCF”) for Mandiant for the years 2022 through 2035 as reflected in the
Forecasts; and (2) a range of illustrative terminal values for Mandiant, which were calculated by applying
perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0%, to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be
generated by Mandiant, as provided by management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by
management of Mandiant (which analysis implied exit terminal year NTM EBITDA multiples ranging from 6.9x
to 12.0x). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model,
which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings,
the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash
tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets
generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional
judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real
growth of gross domestic product and inflation.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Mandiant by adding the range of present
values it derived as described above and the net present value of the net operating losses as reflected in the
Forecasts, as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of Mandiant. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it
derived for Mandiant, the net debt (including the amount of the liquidation preference of Mandiant’s
convertible preferred stock) of Mandiant as of December 31, 2021, as provided by the management of
Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Mandiant, to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for Mandiant. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it
derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Mandiant (which includes the number of shares
of common stock, if any, underlying Mandiant’s convertible preferred stock attributable to the portion of the
value of the convertible preferred stock in excess of the liquidation preference), as provided by the
management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of Mandiant, using the
treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of our common stock ranging
from $13.45 to $21.74.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value
per share of our common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a
theoretical future value of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s financial multiples. For this
analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Goldman Sachs
first calculated the implied enterprise values per share of our common stock as of December 31 for each of
the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by applying multiples of enterprise value to NTM revenue (which is referred to
as “EV/NTM revenue,”) of 6.0x to 8.0x to estimates of Mandiant’s revenue for each of the fiscal years 2023 to
2025. These illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples
for Mandiant and current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples for certain publicly traded companies, as
described below in the section captioned “- Selected Public Company Comparables Analysis.”

Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Mandiant’s forecasted net debt (including the amount of the
liquidation preference of Mandiant’s convertible preferred stock) as of December 31 for each of the fiscal
years 2022 to 2024, each as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use
by the management of Mandiant, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Mandiant as of December
31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of
projected year-end fully diluted shares of our common stock (which includes the number of shares of
common stock, if any, underlying Mandiant’s convertible preferred stock attributable to the portion of the
value of the convertible preferred stock in excess of the liquidation preference) for each of the fiscal years
2022 to 2024, as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of Mandiant, to derive a range of implied future share prices. Goldman Sachs then discounted
the December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024 implied future share prices back to December 31, 2021 using an
illustrative discount rate of 9.5 percent to derive implied present values of future share prices as of December
31, 2021. The illustrative discount rate of 9.5 percent reflected an estimate of Mandiant’s cost of equity.
Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires
certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the
United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of
$17.47 to $26.25 per share of our common stock.
Precedent Transaction Multiples
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions
in the security and infrastructure software and high growth IT services industries since 2013. For each of the
selected transactions where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the
implied EV/NTM revenue of the applicable target company based on the total consideration paid in the
transaction as a multiple of the target company’s NTM revenue based on Institutional Brokers’ Estimate
System estimates (which are referred to as “IBES estimates”) at the time each such selected transaction was
announced. While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly
comparable to Mandiant, the companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with
operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Mandiant’s results,
industry size and product profile.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the various transactions
and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs selected a reference range of EV/​NTM revenue
multiples of 6.0x to 9.0x and applied such range to Mandiant’s NTM revenue as of December 31, 2021, as
provided by the management of Mandiant, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Mandiant.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values the amount of Mandiant’s net
debt (including the amount of the liquidation preference of Mandiant’s convertible preferred stock) as of
December 31, 2021, as provided by the management Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of Mandiant, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Mandiant. Goldman Sachs
divided the results by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (which includes
the number of shares of common stock, if any, underlying Mandiant’s convertible preferred stock
attributable to the portion of the value of the convertible preferred stock in excess of the liquidation
preference), as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of Mandiant, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied equity values per
share of our common stock of $16.08 to $22.30.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-
cash acquisition transactions announced from 2017 through February 14, 2022, involving a public company
based in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was between
$1 billion and $10 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs
calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative
to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis
indicated a median premium of 29 percent across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile
premium of 17 percent and a 75th percentile premium of 49 percent across the period. Using this analysis,
Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 17% to 49 percent to the unaffected closing
price per share of our common stock of $15.06 as of February 7, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity
values per share of our common stock of $17.62 to $22.44.
Selected Public Company Comparables Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following
publicly traded corporations in the security and infrastructure software industry, which are collectively
referred to as the “security comparable companies”:
Cyberark Software Ltd.;
ForgeRock Inc.;
Rapid7 Inc.;
Sailpoint Technologies Holdings Inc.;
Sumo Logic Inc.;
Tenable Holdings Inc.; and
Varonis Systems Inc.
Goldman Sachs also reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following
publicly traded corporations in the high growth IT services industry, which are collectively referred to as the
“services comparable companies”:
Endava PLC - ADR;
EPAM Systems Inc.;
Globant SA; and
Perficient, Inc.
The security comparable companies and the services comparable companies are collectively referred to as
the “comparable companies.” Although none of the comparable companies is directly comparable to
Mandiant, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded companies in the security
and infrastructure software industry and high growth IT services industry, respectively, with operations that
for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Mandiant.
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of March 4, 2022 as a multiple of revenue for
the comparable companies for calendar years 2022 and 2023, based on financial and trading data as of March
4, 2022, information Goldman Sachs obtained from Thomson Reuters and CapIQ, publicly available historical
and market data and IBES estimates, in order to determine an appropriate EV/NTM revenue multiple range for
Goldman Sachs’ illustrative present value of future share price analysis.

General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying
Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all
of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Mandiant or the contemplated merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the
Mandiant Board as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the $23.00 price per share to be paid to
the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, pursuant to the merger
agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based
upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of
Mandiant, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially
different from those forecast.
The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Mandiant and Parent
and was approved by the Mandiant Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Mandiant during these
negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to
Mandiant or the Mandiant Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Mandiant Board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Mandiant Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The
foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman
Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written
opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.
57 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and
services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other
entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest,
may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities,
derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of
Mandiant, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Alphabet Inc. (“Alphabet”), an
affiliate of Parent, and any of its affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or
commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs
acted as financial advisor to Mandiant in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations
leading to, the transaction contemplated by the agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to Mandiant and its affiliates from time to time for which the
Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including
having acted as Mandiant’s financial advisor in connection with the sale of its FireEye Products business in
October 2021. During the two year period ended March 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized
compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking
Division to Mandiant and/or its affiliates of approximately $20 million. Goldman Sachs also has provided
certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Parent, Alphabet and/or their respective affiliates
and portfolio companies from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has
received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Ionic Security Inc., a
former portfolio company of Google Ventures, an affiliate of Alphabet, with respect to its sale in April 2021;
and as financial advisor to Kobalt Music Group Limited, a former portfolio company of Google Ventures, with
respect to its sale in May 2021. During the two year period ended March 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs has
recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment
Banking Division to Parent, Alphabet and/or their respective affiliates and portfolio companies of
approximately $5 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or
underwriting services to Mandiant, Parent, Alphabet and their respective affiliates for which the Investment
Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have
co-invested with Parent, Alphabet and their respective affiliates from time to time and may do so in the
future.
Goldman Sachs also acted as bookrunner with respect to the offering by Mandiant of 0.875% Convertible
Senior Notes due 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, which are referred to as the
“Mandiant convertible notes” and, concurrent with the issuance of the Mandiant convertible notes,
Mandiant entered into capped call transactions with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the
Mandiant convertible notes, which are collectively referred to as the “capped call transactions,” with
Goldman Sachs (with respect to 30% of the shares of common stock underlying the Mandiant convertible
notes) and other counterparties each acting as principal for its own account, consisting of the purchase by
Mandiant of capped call options with respect to collectively approximately 25,900,020 shares of our common
stock, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock underlying the Mandiant convertible notes (at
the initial conversion rate of 43.1667 shares of our common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of Mandiant
convertible notes). The Mandiant convertible notes had an initial strike price equal to $23.17 per share of our
common stock, subject to an initial cap price of $34.32 per share. As of April 20, 2022, 100% of the capped
call transactions remain outstanding, with a strike price of approximately $23.17 and a cap price of $34.32.
The capped call transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on Mandiant
stockholders of the conversion of the Mandiant convertible notes and/or any potential cash payment in
excess of the principal amount of the Mandiant convertible notes that Mandiant may make in connection
with a cash settlement of the Mandiant convertible notes, in each case, up to the cap price. The capped call
transactions, upon the exercise thereof, generally require the capped call counterparties to deliver to
Mandiant upon expiration of the call options, a number of shares of our common stock (and/or in certain
circumstances, at Mandiant’s election, cash) determined based on the excess, if any, of the lower of the cap
price and the price of the shares of our common stock at that time (determined over a period specified in the
capped call transactions) over the strike price per share of our common stock.
58 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The capped call transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance with
their terms in connection with certain events. In particular, under the terms of the capped call transactions,
Goldman Sachs and the other counterparties, each acting separately as calculation agent under the capped
call transactions to which it is a party, are entitled in certain circumstances to make adjustments on more than
one occasion to the terms of such capped call transactions to reflect the economic effect of the
announcement of such events (including the merger) on the embedded call options. In addition, each of
Goldman Sachs and the other counterparties may, acting separately as the calculation agent, determining
party or otherwise as principal under the capped call transactions to which it is a party, determine such
adjustments in respect of such capped call transactions in accordance with their terms, including on or
following consummation or abandonment of such events. All actions or exercises of judgment by Goldman
Sachs, in its capacity as calculation agent, pursuant to the terms of the capped call transactions to which it
is a party must be performed in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner.
As a result of the capped call transactions, the capped call counterparties are expected to have market
exposure to the price of the shares of our common stock. It is the ordinary practice of the capped call
counterparties to engage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the price of the
stock underlying privately negotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the
capped call transactions. In connection with the capped call transactions to which it is a party, Goldman
Sachs (and its affiliates) have engaged, and will continue to engage, in accordance with applicable law in
hedging and other market transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various
derivative transactions with respect to our common stock) that are generally intended to substantially
neutralize Goldman Sachs’ exposure as a result of the capped call transactions to which it is a party to
changes in the price of our common stock. Such hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs’ own risk and may
result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be greater than or less than the initial expected contractual
benefit to Goldman Sachs under the capped call transactions to which it is a party. The amount of any such
gain or loss will not be known until the applicable capped call transactions have been exercised, expired or
terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs shall have completed all of its hedge unwind
activities. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary institutional
information barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information
by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its Securities Division who are
undertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs’ capped call transactions.
To mitigate the exposure from the capped call transactions, as of April 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs held a net
long economic position of approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock.
Goldman Sachs provided to management of Mandiant, for the information of the Mandiant Board, materials
that summarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the announcement and of the
consummation of an acquisition of Mandiant on the capped call transactions. The materials included
preliminary illustrative analyses by Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division for a range of stated
assumptions regarding takeout prices for shares of our common stock and volatilities, as well as based on
other reasonable assumptions, in the event of an acquisition of Mandiant for greater than 10 percent cash
consideration. The materials calculated over a range of potential takeout prices for the shares of our common
stock ranging from $16.00 per share to $26.00 per share and volatilities (from 25 percent to 35 percent) and for
an announcement date of March 10, 2022, and other stated assumptions that upon the full unwind of the
capped call transactions, Goldman Sachs might realize, after taking into account any estimated hedging gains
or losses, a net gain or loss ranging from a net loss of approximately $1.8 million to a net gain of
approximately $4.8 million. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary
institutional information barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential
information by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its Securities Division who
are undertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs’ capped call
transactions. In connection with the preparation of presentations to senior management of Mandiant and the
Mandiant Board, personnel in Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division, including the representatives of
Goldman Sachs who have advised Mandiant in connection with the merger, from time to time, have received
or may receive input from personnel in Goldman Sachs’ Securities Division into how to model, or reports of
historical measures or estimates of, Goldman Sachs’ and/or Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division’s
profit and/or loss over certain measurement periods related to the capped call transactions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The indentures governing the Mandiant convertible notes and the confirmations containing the terms of the
capped call transactions were included as exhibits to Mandiant’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
SEC on May 25, 2018, which contains additional disclosure regarding the Mandiant convertible notes and a
description of the capped call transactions. All references in this section to share counts, conversion prices,
cap prices and strike prices are subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the terms of the
confirmations relating to the capped call transactions.
The Mandiant Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger.
Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 16, 2019, Mandiant engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its
financial advisor in connection with the contemplated merger. The engagement letter between Mandiant and
Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the
date of announcement and assuming that certain Mandiant convertible notes are redeemed prior to the close
of the transaction per guidance from Mandiant management, at approximately $73 million, all of which is
contingent upon consummation of the merger. The transaction fee is subject to upward adjustment by
approximately $11.5 million in the event that none of the Mandiant convertible notes are redeemed prior to
the close of the transaction. In addition, Mandiant has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its
expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons
against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.",60,69

Other than in connection with its regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as
a matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other
reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates.
However, Mandiant management regularly prepares projections as to our future financial performance for
internal use.
In connection with our strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic alternatives, Mandiant
management prepared and provided to the Mandiant Board various unaudited forward-looking financial
information for fiscal years 2022 through 2035. This forward-looking information is collectively referred to as
the “Projected Financial Information.” The Projected Financial Information was approved by Mandiant for
Goldman Sachs’ use for purposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its
fairness opinion to the Mandiant Board (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “- Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”). A summary of the Projected Financial Information is set
forth below.
The Projected Financial Information was developed by Mandiant management without giving effect to the
merger or to any changes to Mandiant’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the
consummation of the merger. The Projected Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any
failure of the merger to be completed; it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Projected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In
addition, the Projected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward complying with the
guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to
prospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other
independent accountants have (1) compiled, reviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with
respect to the Projected Financial Information; (2) expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on
such information or the achievability of the Projected Financial Information; or (3) assumed any
responsibility for the Projected Financial Information. Our independent registered public accounting firm
disclaims any association with the Projected Financial Information.
The Projected Financial Information was prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Mandiant management. In
preparing the Projected Financial Information, Mandiant management utilized the following material
assumptions:
An accelerated revenue growth rate of approximately 15 percent to 50 percent in years 2022 through
2025 in our Platform, Cloud Subscriptions and Managed Services business as the Mandiant
Advantage platform achieves maturity and is consequently sold into Mandiant’s customer base;
60 • 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Annual recurring revenue and compound annual growth rate of greater than 30 percent from 2022
through 2025;
Growth of 15 percent to 23 percent in the Professional Services business consistent with our
historical experience of growth of approximately 20 percent per year, with future growth of 15 percent
to 23 percent further influenced by the following: (1) Mandiant’s ability to retain consultants at
similar rates to historical trends in an increasingly competitive environment; (2) Mandiant’s ability to
grow revenue internationally at an accelerated pace of over 20 percent per year given the continued
investments required to build the Mandiant brand internationally; and (3) increasing utilization rates
by approximately 3 percent to 5 percent over the historical utilization rates between 55 percent and 60
percent for Mandiant consulting driven by increased deferred revenue in our Professional Services
business and the ability to deliver services remotely from anywhere in the world;
Improved non-GAAP operating margins moving from double digit negative operating margins to
exiting 2025 with operating margins above 20 percent due to revenues increasing on average over 20
percent per year through 2025, a greater rate than the increase in operating expenses of between 5
percent to 18 percent per year through 2025, which also assumes the provision by us of certain
transition services to the buyer in connection with the divestiture of the FireEye Products business;
and
No material acquisitions or divestitures by Mandiant.
Mandiant management, using its business judgment, believed in good faith the above assumptions were
reasonable and, as a result of this belief, the opinion of Mandiant management was that the Projected
Financial Information (1) was prepared on a reasonable basis; (2) reflected the best estimates and judgments
then available (taking into account the relevant information available to Mandiant management at that time);
and (3) presented, to Mandiant management’s knowledge, our expected future financial performance within
the parameters and under the assumptions specified in preparing the Projected Financial Information.
Because the Projected Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to
sensitivities and assumptions, as well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business
developments. The Projected Financial Information also covers multiple years, and such information by its
nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Projected Financial Information is not, and
should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Projected Financial
Information is not fact, is subjective in many respects, and should not be relied upon as being necessarily
indicative of Mandiant’s future results.
Although the Projected Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous
assumptions and estimates as to future events, including those detailed above, made by Mandiant
management that Mandiant management believed in good faith were reasonable. Our ability to achieve the
financial results contemplated by the Projected Financial Information will be affected by our ability to
achieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Projected Financial
Information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important
factors that may affect actual results and cause the Projected Financial Information not to be achieved
include, among others, (1) general economic conditions (including the impact of COVID-19 and COVID-19
measures); (2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or projected cash
flows; (4) changes in tax laws; (5) competitive pressures, including new market entrants and changes in the
competitive environment; (6) customer demand for our products and services; (7) our ability to attract,
integrate and retain qualified personnel; (8) our ability to develop new services and product features; and (9)
our ability to implement various business transformation initiatives, including a new enterprise resource
planning system to improve our cost structure. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be
found in the various risk factors included in our periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult
to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the
Projected Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than
those contained in the Projected Financial Information. The Projected Financial Information may differ from
publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date
that it was prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the merger agreement. You should
evaluate the Projected Financial Information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical financial statements
and other information regarding Mandiant contained in our public filings with the SEC. The Projected
Financial
61 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Information may not be consistent with Mandiant’s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions
detailed above and due to the material changes in our business as a result of and following the divestiture of
the FireEye Products business. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not
intend to update or otherwise revise the Projected Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing
after the date that such information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Projected Financial Information are “non-GAAP financial
measures.” These are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and
may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are
limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are
required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be
considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with
GAAP.
Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in
connection with a business combination transaction, such as the Projected Financial Information, are
excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and regulations.
As a result, the Projected Financial Information is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-
GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure
to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied
upon by the Mandiant Board or Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures
included in the Projected Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.
The Projected Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. For information on factors that
may cause Mandiant’s future results to materially vary, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Forward Looking Statements”. By including the Projected Financial Information in this proxy statement,
neither we nor any of our advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any
person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Projected
Financial Information. The inclusion of the Projected Financial Information should not be regarded as an
indication that the Mandiant Board, Mandiant or any other recipient of the Projected Financial Information
considered, or now considers, the Projected Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results.
Further, the inclusion of the Projected Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an
admission or representation by Mandiant that the information presented is material. The Projected Financial
Information is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information that
was made available to the Mandiant Board and Goldman Sachs for purposes of performing its financial
analyses in connection with rendering its fairness opinion to the Mandiant Board (as described in more
detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”). The
Projected Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement for the purpose of influencing any
Mandiant stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not
to seek appraisal rights with respect to such stockholder’s shares.
Certain of the Projected Financial Information was also provided to Parent.

When considering the recommendation of the Mandiant Board that you vote to approve the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders.
Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, our chief executive officer, Kevin
Mandia, in his capacity as a stockholder of Mandiant, entered into a voting agreement with Parent and
Mandiant. The voting agreement obligates Mr. Mandia to vote certain of his shares of our common stock in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against any competing transaction. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - The Voting Agreements.” In (1)
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and
(3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Mandiant Board was aware
of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These
interests are more fully described below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Mandiant will be entitled to certain
ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage, including under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement - 
Indemnification and Insurance.”
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
Treatment of Mandiant Restricted Stock Units
As of April 6, 2022, there were outstanding awards of Mandiant restricted stock units (or portions thereof)

covering an aggregate of 92,010 shares of our common stock were held by our current non-employee
directors and of which Mandiant restricted stock units covering an aggregate of 957,375 shares of our
common stock were held by our current executive officers. As of the same date, there were outstanding
Mandiant PSUs that cover an aggregate of 2,361,933 shares of our common stock (at maximum level of
performance), of which Mandiant PSUs covering an aggregate of 1,183,248 shares of our common stock (at

Each vested Mandiant restricted stock unit will accelerate vesting in full (to the extent not already vested)
and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (1) the excess of the per share price over the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, of such
vested Mandiant restricted stock unit and (2) the total number of shares of our common stock then-subject
to such vested Mandiant restricted stock unit. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)
will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.
Each unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess of the per share price over the
exercise or purchase price per share, if any, of such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit and (2) the total
number of shares of our common stock then-subject to such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit. Such
cash amount will (1) vest and become payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) in accordance
with the vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, subject to such holder’s continued service with Parent
and its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates, and (2) be subject to the terms and conditions of the
unvested payment plan.
All other Mandiant restricted stock units not described above that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be canceled for no consideration.
Treatment of Mandiant Performance-Based Awards
Each completed Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the completed Mandiant PSU consideration with such completed Mandiant PSU
consideration vesting in accordance with the service-based vesting schedule applicable to such completed
Mandiant PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and subject to the terms of the unvested
payment plan.
At the effective time of the merger, each uncompleted Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted into a
right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the uncompleted Mandiant PSU consideration
with such uncompleted Mandiant PSU consideration vesting in accordance with the service-based vesting
schedule applicable to such uncompleted Mandiant PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
and subject to the terms of the unvested payment plan.
Treatment of Mandiant Options
As of April 6, 2022, there were outstanding Mandiant options to purchase an aggregate of 1,560,830 shares
of our common stock (with a weighted average exercise price of $7.5101), of which none were held by our
current non-employee directors or current executive officers.
Each Mandiant option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will accelerate vesting in full and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise
price per share of such Mandiant option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable
upon exercise in full of such Mandiant option. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)
will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.
Any Mandiant option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater
than the per share price will be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.
Treatment of the ESPP
Prior to the effective time of the merger Mandiant will take all action necessary to cause any offering period
or purchase period under the ESPP that is outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement to be
terminated no later than ten business days prior to the date of the closing of the merger. We will also make
any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase
period. Mandiant will cause the exercise (as of no later than ten business days prior to the closing date of
the merger) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP. On such exercise date, Mandiant will
apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the
purchase of whole shares of Mandiant common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately
prior to and

effective as of the effective time of the merger Mandiant will terminate the ESPP. No further offering period or
purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP on or after the date of the closing of the merger. The
amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP will, to the extent not used to
purchase shares of common stock, be refunded in cash to such participant as promptly as practicable
following the effective time of the merger.
Equity Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and Executive Officers
The following table sets forth for each person who has been an executive officer, which consists of each
individual referred to as a “named executive officer” for purposes of this proxy statement (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement below captioned “- Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation”), or a member of the Mandiant Board at any time since the
beginning of Mandiant’s 2021 fiscal year, (1) the number of shares of our common stock directly held; and (2)
the number of shares of our common stock subject to his or her Mandiant restricted stock units and
Mandiant PSUs (at actual levels of achievement for any completed Mandiant PSUs and at maximum levels of
achievement for any uncompleted Mandiant PSUs), in each case as of April 6, 2022, assuming the following
and such additional assumptions set forth in the footnotes to the table:
the Mandiant restricted stock units and Mandiant PSUs that were outstanding as of April 6, 2022
represent the full extent of equity awards that Mandiant will have granted to each named executive
officer and member of the Mandiant Board through June 30, 2022, the assumed closing date of the
merger solely for purposes of this proxy statement, provided that such awards (or portions thereof)
that are expected to vest or be paid in accordance with their terms prior to June 30, 2022 are treated as
having vested or been paid in accordance with their terms and excluded from the Mandiant restricted
stock unit amounts and included in the shares held directly amounts in the table;
as of April 6, 2022, none of our named executive officers or members of the Mandiant Board hold any
Mandiant options; and
that the values of these shares of our common stock and equity-based awards are equal to the per
share price of $23.00.

2013 Equity Incentive Plan
We have granted certain Mandiant restricted stock units, and Mandiant PSUs under our 2013 Equity

Severance Policy
In July 2013, our compensation committee adopted and approved a Change of Control Severance Policy for
Officers (which we refer to as the “Severance Policy”), which was last updated on October 4, 2021. All of our
executive officers and certain of our non-executive officers (collectively referred to as “eligible employees”)
are generally eligible for severance payments and benefits under the Severance Policy, subject to executing a
participation agreement and the conditions described below. Each eligible employee may receive payments
and benefits upon a termination of employment without “cause” or a resignation for “good reason”  (as such
terms are generally defined below) (each of which, we refer to as a “qualified termination of employment”)
anytime from three months prior to a change of control through 12 months following a change of control of
Mandiant (which we refer to as the “change of control period”). In addition, eligible employees may receive
severance payments and benefits for qualified terminations of employment outside of the change of control
period. The payments and benefits in the Severance Policy vary based on whether an eligible employee is an
officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (which we refer to as a “Tier 1 Executive,”) or is not an
officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (which we refer to as a “Tier II Executive.”).
In the event of a qualified termination of employment, during the change of control period, an eligible
employee will receive the following:
Tier I Executive or Tier II Executive:
lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months’ base salary;

lump-sum cash payment equal to a pro-rata target bonus for the year of termination;
100% acceleration of all then-unvested equity awards with unvested performance awards vesting
at maximum level; and
paid COBRA continuation for 12 months.
In the event of a termination of employment without “cause”  (as generally defined below) outside of the
change of control period, an eligible employee will receive the following:
Tier I Executive:
lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months’ base salary; and
paid COBRA continuation for 12 months.
Tier II Executive:
lump-sum cash payment equal to six months’ base salary; and
paid COBRA continuation for six months.
All severance payments and benefits under the Severance Policy are subject to the eligible employee
executing and not revoking a general release of clams in favor of Mandiant. Payments and benefits under the
Severance Policy replace any then-existing severance and/or change of control payment and benefit
arrangements that an eligible employee had previously been entitled to receive. All of our named executive
officers have entered into a participation agreement with us.
For purposes of the Severance Policy, “cause” means, generally, an eligible employee’s:
unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or trade secrets, which use or
disclosure causes material harm to us;
material breach of any agreement between us and the eligible employee;
material failure to comply with our written policies or rules;
conviction of, or plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to, a felony under the laws of the United States or
any State;
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of the named executive officer’s duties;
continuing failure to perform assigned duties after receiving written notification of the failure from
our chief executive officer; or
failure to cooperate in good faith with a governmental or internal investigation of Mandiant or our
directors, officers or employees, if we have requested such cooperation;
provided, however, that “cause” will not be deemed to exist in certain of the events above unless the eligible
employee has been provided with (i) 30 days’ written notice by the Mandiant Board of the act or omission
constituting “cause” and (ii) 30 days’ opportunity to cure such act or omission, if capable of cure.
For purposes of the Severance Policy, “good reason” means generally any of the following without an
eligible employee’s consent:
a material reduction in the eligible employee’s duties, authority, reporting relationship, or
responsibilities;
a material reduction in the eligible employee’s annual cash compensation;
a requirement to relocate to a location more than 20 miles from the eligible employee’s then-current
office location;
a material breach by us of the eligible employee’s employment agreement or any other agreement
between the eligible employee and us; or
a failure by any successor entity to assume the Severance Policy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding certain
compensation for each of Mandiant’s named executive officers that is based on, or that otherwise relates to,
the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC
disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable
to Mandiant’s named executive officers. Mandiant’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the
disclosure in this proxy statement are Messrs. Bailey, Mandia, Robbins, Verdecanna and Watters and Ms.
King. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments quantified below, see the sections of this
proxy statement captioned “- Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - 
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards” and “- Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger - Severance Policy.”
The amounts in the table are estimated using the following assumptions and such additional assumptions as
may be set forth in the footnotes to the table:
the effective time of the merger will occur on June 30, 2022 (which is the assumed closing date of the
merger solely for purposes of this proxy statement, including this golden parachute compensation
disclosure);
each named executive officer will experience a qualifying termination of his or her employment at the
effective time of the merger that results in severance benefits becoming payable to such named
executive officer under the Severance Policy;
the equity awards that are outstanding as of April 6, 2022 represent the full extent of equity awards
that Mandiant will have granted to the named executive officer through June 30, 2022, the assumed
closing date of the merger, provided that such equity awards that are expected to vest or be paid in
accordance with their terms prior to June 30, 2022 are treated as having vested or been paid in
accordance with their terms and excluded from the amounts in the table; and
the number of shares of our common stock subject to Mandiant PSUs will be determined at actual
levels of achievement for any completed Mandiant PSUs and at maximum levels of achievement for
any uncompleted Mandiant PSUs.
The amounts reported below are estimates based on these and other assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a
named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.
Mandiant’s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax
reimbursements in connection with the merger. In addition, the estimated amounts below do not attempt to
quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of any cutback under Section 280G of the Code. As
required by applicable SEC rules, all estimated amounts below that are determined using the per share value
of our common stock have been calculated based on the per share price.

DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex B and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following summary does not
constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is
entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial
interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker
or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder’s
shares. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure that appraisal
rights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262, which is attached here as
Annex B, as well as the information discussed below. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding
and perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights.
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) do
not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously are the record
holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger; (3) submit a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares to Mandiant prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (4)
otherwise comply with the procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262; and
(5) do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares or otherwise lose their rights to
appraisal, in each case in accordance with Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares of our common
stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of
their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to
be the fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment. However,
after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine
stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who
asserted appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our common stock for which appraisal
rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock
as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (2) the value of the merger consideration in
respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.”
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the
70 •

TABLE OF CONTENTS
merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment
to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference,
if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under
no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they
would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,
the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as
of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a
copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Mandiant’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal
rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex B. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who wishes
to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex B
carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may
result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights
will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek
appraisal of shares of our common stock, Mandiant believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising
such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do
ALL of the following:
the stockholder must not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement;
the stockholder must deliver to Mandiant a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the
merger agreement at the special meeting;
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
effective time of the merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the
shares before the effective time of the merger); and
a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in
a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the shares of
all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation
is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to
determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our
stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 is
met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, each of our stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting with respect
to such proposal.
Filing Written Demand
A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Mandiant, before the vote on the adoption
of the merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s
shares. In addition, that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption
71 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special
meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your
appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for
appraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written
demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of
the merger. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder and state that the person
intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the merger. A proxy that is
submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify
any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and
who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the
adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither
voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal
satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the
adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written
demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will
constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Mandiant of the identity of the
holder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. If the
shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if such shares are owned
of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be
executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or
more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent
must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is
acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A record holder, such as a broker who holds shares of
Mandiant’s common stock as nominee for several beneficial owners, may exercise appraisal rights with
respect to the shares of Mandiant’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the
shares of Mandiant’s common stock held for other beneficial owners; in such case, however, the written
demand should set forth the number of shares of Mandiant’s common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as to which appraisal is sought and where no number of
shares of common stock is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of
Mandiant’s common stock which are held in the name of the record owner. Stockholders who hold their
shares of Mandiant’s common stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise
appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.
A beneficial owner of shares of Mandiant’s common stock held in “street name” who desires appraisal
should take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is
made by the record holder of such shares. Shares of Mandiant common stock held through brokerage firms,
banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a
nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co. Any beneficial holder desiring appraisal who
holds shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution is responsible for ensuring that the
demand for appraisal is made by the record holder. The beneficial holder of such shares should instruct such
firm, bank or institution that the demand for appraisal be made by the record holder of the shares, which may
be the nominee of a central security depository if the shares have been so deposited.
ONLY A HOLDER OF RECORD OF SHARES OF MANDIANT’S COMMON STOCK IS ENTITLED TO
DEMAND APPRAISAL RIGHTS FOR THE SHARES REGISTERED IN THAT HOLDER’S NAME.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR “STREET NAME” BY A BANK,
BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO
72 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR
OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE
BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE
SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF
ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY
TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
Mandiant, Inc. 
11951 Freedom Drive, 6th Floor 
Reston, VA 20190 
Attention: Corporate Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock
may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the
merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to Mandiant, as
the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to
withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written
approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective
time of the merger. If Mandiant, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a
demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who
withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with
respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in
any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price
being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will
notify each record holder of shares of our common stock who has properly made a written demand for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement,
that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any
holder of shares of our common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 (or the beneficial owner of such shares) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a
petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all
dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no
present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will
file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of our common stock.
Accordingly, any holders of shares of our common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should
initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock
within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the
period specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has
complied with the requirements for an appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be
73 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to
which Mandiant has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares.
The surviving corporation must send this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after
receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares
of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the foregoing
statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is
served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after
such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to
the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of
the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the
stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given
by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or any other publication which the Delaware Court
of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.
After notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to
comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert
appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and
perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as measured in accordance
with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for
which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of our common stock entitled to appraisal, and
that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking
appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through
such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of our
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and
will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established
from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of
Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder
seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h)
of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash
payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the
74 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of
value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community
and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “fair price obviously requires
consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated
that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends,
earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date
of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that
fair value is to be “exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a
“narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme
Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the
consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and
that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262. Although Mandiant believes that the per share price is fair, no representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should
recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the
per share price. Neither Mandiant nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per share price to any
stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Mandiant and Parent reserves the rights to make a
voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of our common stock is less than the
per share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above
has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will
cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses
of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s
fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to
an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262
fails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of
our common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to
receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose, such holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our
stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the
merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in
compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if
such stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand
for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an
appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that
may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common
stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is
based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the “Code”) Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we
refer to as the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and
all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This
discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our common stock as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be
relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations,
partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for
U.S. federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and
securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their
securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S.
anti-inversion rules; holders who hold their common stock as “qualified small business stock” for
purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code; Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by
attribution) more than five percent of our common stock; or certain former citizens or long-term
residents of the United States;
tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,
straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory
transaction or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or
other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross
income with respect to the shares of our common stock being taken into account in an “applicable
financial statement”  (as defined in the Code);
the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein should
consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the merger described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that
a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX
LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the
control of one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) has
a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States
person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will
be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will
be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will
equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one
year at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to
long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of shares of our common stock at
different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period
separately with respect to each block of our common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our
common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax unless:
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain
generally will
77 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S.
Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent
(or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other conditions are met, in which case such
gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty); or
Mandiant is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined
in Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as “USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the
five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the
applicable shares of our common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant period”) and, if shares of
our common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively)
more than five percent of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case
such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as
described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a
corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the
Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property
interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real
property interests generally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Although
there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC
at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to
consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds
received by a holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder
that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to
backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a)
provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8
(or a substitute or successor form); or (b) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will
be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.
A U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder’s common stock and file with its U.S.
federal income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts
relating to the merger.
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued
thereunder (which we refer to as “FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain
payments made to a “foreign financial institution”  (as specially defined under these rules) unless such
institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect
and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such
institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account
holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose
a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless
such entity provides the withholding agent a certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners
of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an
applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder
might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The U.S. Treasury Department released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would
eliminate the federal withholding tax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other
disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the Treasury Department
stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Holders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible
implications of FATCA on the disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.",85,88

General Efforts
Under the merger agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and Mandiant agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take
all actions and do all things necessary, proper or, in the good faith discretion of Parent, advisable, pursuant
to applicable law or otherwise to consummate the merger and the conversion of the convertible preferred
stock by no later than the termination date (as it may be extended in accordance with the merger agreement).
HSR Act; Competition Laws; Foreign Investment Laws
Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until Parent and Mandiant file a Notification and Report
Form with the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) and the applicable waiting period
has expired or been terminated. The parties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on
March 21, 2022. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-
calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the
early termination of that waiting period. On April 20, 2022, Mandiant and Parent each received a Second
Request from the DOJ in connection with the DOJ’s review of the merger. The issuance of the Second
Request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both Mandiant and Parent have
substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ or
extended by agreement of Mandiant and Parent.
Mandiant and Parent have each agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause
the other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by
the FTC, the DOJ or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any antitrust
and FDI filing is made; and (2) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to, as
soon as practicable, (a) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the
HSR Act and any other antitrust and FDI laws applicable to the merger and/or the conversion of the
convertible preferred stock by the termination date (as it may be extended in accordance with the merger
agreement) and (b) obtain any required consents pursuant to any antitrust and FDI laws applicable to the
merger and/or the conversion of the convertible preferred stock by the termination date (as it may be
extended in accordance with the merger agreement).
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and
notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action
under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Mandiant or Parent. Private parties
may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Antitrust and FDI approvals of the merger are required in various jurisdictions throughout Europe, the
Middle East and Asia. As of the date of this proxy statement, Mandiant and Parent have determined to make
antitrust notifications in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Taiwan and Turkey, and may make notifications in other
jurisdictions. One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification,
requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties
may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals,
which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There
79 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or
whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between
the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, none of Parent and Merger Sub is required to (and, without the
consent of Parent, none of Mandiant or its affiliates may) (1) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (a) the sale, divestiture, license, other disposition of any and all of
the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products
or businesses of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective affiliates, Mandiant or any of its controlled affiliates,
and (b) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective affiliates, Mandiant or
any of its controlled affiliates; or (2) initiate, contest, defend or appeal any legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, against any governmental authority challenging the merger agreement or the
consummation of the merger or the conversion of the convertible preferred stock.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure
you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the
granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional
conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These
conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.",88,89
"Mandiant, Inc._20220428_DEFM14A_20042183_4449873.Pdf",The Voting Agreements,"The Voting Agreements
In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on March 7, 2022, following the Mandiant Board’s
approval thereof, Mandiant’s convertible preferred stockholders, Blackstone and ClearSky, and Mr. Mandia,
in each case in their capacities as stockholders of Mandiant (which we refer to as the “voting agreement
stockholders”), entered into the voting agreements with Parent and Mandiant. As of the record date, the
voting agreements cover, in the aggregate, approximately 11.80 percent of our common stock (on an as-
converted-into-common-stock basis and excluding shares of our common stock issuable upon vesting of
Mandiant restricted stock units and Mandiant PSUs). A copy of each voting agreement is attached as Annex
D-1 through Annex D-3 to this proxy statement.
Under the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed to vote all of their respective
shares of our common stock and convertible preferred stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby and by the other transaction
documents, including the merger, (2) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of
Mandiant’s stockholders to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement, and
(3) against (a) any action or proposal in favor of an acquisition proposal, without regard to the terms of such
acquisition proposal, and (b) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be likely
to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. The voting agreement stockholders have also waived appraisal rights in connection with
the merger and have agreed not to raise certain legal challenges to the merger. In the case of the convertible
preferred stockholders, the voting agreements obligate the convertible preferred stockholders to take all
steps necessary to convert all of their shares of Mandiant’s convertible preferred stock into shares of
common stock, including delivering to Mandiant a conversion notice in respect of their convertible preferred
stock concurrently with the execution and delivery of the voting agreements, prior to the effective time of the
merger and, in the case of Blackstone, prior to any exercise of remedies by their lenders with respect to such
shares, if earlier.
Pursuant to the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed not to, until the earlier of
(x) the expiration of the voting agreements and (y) the date when the requisite stockholder approval is
obtained, directly or indirectly transfer, either voluntarily or involuntarily, or enter into any contract, option
or other arrangement or understanding providing for the transfer, of any rights arising from any shares of our
convertible preferred stock or common stock. The foregoing restriction does not apply to any ordinary
course transfer by members of voting agreement stockholders of any equity interests in such stockholder, so
long as any such transfer does not have any adverse effect on the ability of the voting agreement
stockholder to perform its obligations pursuant to the voting agreements. The voting agreement
stockholders have agreed that in connection with any transfer of shares of convertible preferred stock
(including all in-kind dividends thereon), at any time following the date on which the requisite stockholder
approval is obtained and prior to the expiration of the applicable voting agreement, prior to and as a
condition to the effectiveness of such transfer: (1) such voting agreement stockholders must give reasonable
advance
80 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
notice of any proposed transfer to Parent and Mandiant and the proposed form of written undertaking by the
transferee to be bound by the applicable voting agreement as if such transferee were a voting agreement
stockholder; (2) such form of undertaking must be reasonably satisfactory in all material respects to Parent
and Mandiant; and (3) the transferee must have executed and delivered, for the benefit of Parent and
Mandiant, such undertaking to be bound by the applicable voting agreement as if such transferee were such
voting agreement stockholder. In respect of the voting agreements with Blackstone, the restrictions on
transfer contained therein do not apply to any transfers of shares pursuant to (i) a pledge to their lenders or
a collateral agent on behalf thereof; or (ii) pursuant to a foreclosure or exercise of remedies (or transfer in lieu
of foreclosure) by any such lender or collateral agent (and the voting obligations of Blackstone shall not
apply following any exercise of remedies with respect to shares sold or transferred by the lender or collateral
agent with respect to such exercise).
The voting agreement stockholders’ obligations to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
terminate (except with respect to certain provisions that survive such termination) automatically upon the
earliest to occur of (1) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, (2) the effective
time of the merger, or (3) the entry into any amendment or modification to, or waiver of Mandiant’s rights
under the merger agreement that (a) results in a decrease in, change in the composition of, or otherwise
adversely affects the merger consideration, (b) extends the termination date (except as contemplated by the
merger agreement), or (c) modifies in any material respect Article II or Article VII of the merger agreement in a
manner that is adverse to Mandiant’s stockholders without the prior written consent of the stockholders

Board, captioned Boncore v. Mandiant, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02988. We refer to the complaints referenced
in this paragraph collectively as the “Complaints.”
The Complaints assert claims against all defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder for allegedly false and misleading statements in Mandiant’s preliminary proxy
statement and against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged “control
person” liability with respect to such allegedly false or misleading statements. The allegations in the
Complaints include that the preliminary proxy statement omitted material information regarding Mandiant’s
financial projections, the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, the sales process leading up to the merger,
potential conflicts of interest involving Mandiant insiders, and potential conflicts of interest involving
Goldman Sachs. The Complaints seek, among other relief, (1) to enjoin defendants from consummating the
merger; (2) to rescind the merger or recover damages, if the merger is completed; (3) declaratory relief; and (4)
attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants believe that the claims are without merit. Additional lawsuits
arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. No assurances can be made as to the outcome of such
lawsuits or the Complaints.

MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a
nonbinding, advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger - Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute
Compensation,” including the additional disclosures referenced therein that otherwise are disclosed in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.”
We are asking our stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger - Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - 
Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and additional disclosures referenced
therein. The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made
generally have previously formed part of Mandiant’s overall compensation program for our named executive
officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted
and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Mandiant Board, which is composed solely of non-
employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Mandiant, Inc. approve the compensation that will or may become
payable to Mandiant’s named executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item
402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger - Interests of Mandiant’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” in Mandiant’s proxy statement for the
special meeting.”
Our stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a
nonbinding, advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Mandiant, the Mandiant Board or Parent.
Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to
stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is
consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or
that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those
payments.

any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies,
including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting
against adoption of the merger agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could

qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to
carefully read and consider the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger,
and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement
that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger
agreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger
agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made
solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications,
limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard
of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in
some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Mandiant in
connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been
included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Mandiant and
Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of
materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the
representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the
circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger
if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance
or otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and
should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof
as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Mandiant, Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the
representations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no
legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not
rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of
Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly
permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the
appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is
described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Mandiant, Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information
provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Mandiant and our
business.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place (1) at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, located at 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304 (or
remotely via the electronic exchange of documents), on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than
the fourth business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement)

conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of each of such conditions; or (2) at such other time, location and date mutually agreed to in
writing by Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The
merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of such certificate of merger, or at a later time
agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.

will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.
Each unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess of the per share price over the
exercise or purchase price per share, if any, of such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit and (2) the total
number of shares of our common stock then-subject to such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit. Such
cash amount will (1) vest and become payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) in accordance
with the vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, subject to such holder’s continued service with Parent
and its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates, and (2) be subject to the terms and conditions of the
unvested payment plan.
All other Mandiant restricted stock units not described above that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be canceled for no consideration.
Treatment of Mandiant Performance-Based Awards
Each completed Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to completed Mandiant PSU consideration with such completed Mandiant PSU
consideration vesting in accordance with the service-based vesting schedule applicable to such completed
Mandiant PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and subject to the terms of the unvested
payment plan.
At the effective time of the merger, each uncompleted Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted into a
right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the uncompleted Mandiant PSU consideration
with such uncompleted Mandiant PSU consideration vesting in accordance with the service-based vesting
schedule applicable to such uncompleted Mandiant PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
and subject to the terms of the unvested payment plan.
Treatment of Mandiant Options
Each Mandiant option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will accelerate vesting in full and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise
price per share of such Mandiant option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable
upon exercise in full of such Mandiant option. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)
will be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.
Any Mandiant option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater
than the per share price will be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.
Treatment of the ESPP
Prior to the effective time of the merger, Mandiant will take all action necessary to cause any offering period
or purchase period under the ESPP that was outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement to be
terminated no later than ten business days prior to the date of the closing of the merger. We will also make
any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase
period. Mandiant will cause the exercise (as of no later than ten business days prior to the closing date of
the merger) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP. On such exercise date, Mandiant will
apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the
purchase of whole shares of Mandiant common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately
prior to and effective as of the effective time of the merger Mandiant will terminate the ESPP. No further

Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will appoint a payment agent reasonably acceptable to Mandiant,
which we refer to as the “payment agent,” to make payments of the merger consideration to our
stockholders. On the closing date of the merger or the first business day following the closing date of the
merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the payment agent, an amount of cash that is
sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate per share price to our stockholders in accordance with the
merger agreement.
Promptly (and in any event within three business days) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and
the surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger represented outstanding shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter of
transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for merger
consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and signed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the payment agent, the
holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the
aggregate number of shares of our common stock represented by such certificate and (b) the per share price.
The amount of any per share price paid to our stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by
any applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of our common stock held in book-entry form (which we
refer to as “uncertificated shares”) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal (as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof. Each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of
uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding
share of our common stock will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form at the effective time
of the merger, and any documents as may reasonably be requested by the payment agent, be entitled to
receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock represented by such holder’s
transferred uncertificated shares; and (2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such
Mandiant stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of
the merger, such cash will be returned to Parent upon demand, and any of our stockholders as of immediately
prior to the merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to abandoned
property law, escheat law or similar laws). None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving corporation or
any other party will be liable to any of our stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such
certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then the payment agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the making by such
holder of an affidavit for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the payment agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to
deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the payment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation or the payment agent with respect to such certificate.

requisite stockholder approval, (a) Mandiant may refrain from enforcing, and may waive, any provision of
any “standstill” or confidentiality agreement to the extent that such provision prohibits or purports to
prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Mandiant Board (or any committee thereof) if the
Mandiant Board (or a committee thereof) has determined that a failure to refrain from such enforcement or a
failure to grant such waiver would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties

respective representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to Mandiant a bona fide written acquisition
proposal after the date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in material breach of the applicable
restrictions, but only if the Mandiant Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that (1) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal
or would be reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and (2) the failure to take such actions would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. From the date
of the merger agreement to the effective time of the merger (or, if earlier, the termination of the merger
agreement), Mandiant has agreed that it will prior to or contemporaneously make available to Parent and its
representatives any non-public information concerning Mandiant and its subsidiaries that is provided to any
such person or its representatives that was not previously made available to Parent or its representatives.
From the date of the merger agreement to the effective time of the merger (or, if earlier, the termination of the

receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if any acquisition proposal, or inquiry about making an offer,
indication of interest or proposal relating to an acquisition proposal, is received by, any nonpublic
information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
with, Mandiant or any of its representatives. Such notice must include (1) the identity of the person or group
making such proposal, inquiry or request; and (2) a summary of the terms and conditions of such proposal,
inquiry or request and, if in writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, Mandiant must keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such acquisition proposal, inquiry or request

occurrence of a material event or development and after Parent so requests in writing (or, if the
Mandiant stockholder meeting is scheduled to be held within ten (10) business days, then within one
business day after Parent so requests in writing) (it being understood that Mandiant will not be
obligated to affirm the Mandiant Board’s recommendation to adopt the merger agreement more than
once per material event (but that any material change to such material event will constitute a  new
material event for purposes of this parenthetical));
take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make and maintain any recommendation in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a publicly disclosed recommendation against
such offer or the issuance of a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Mandiant Board (or a
committee thereof) to our stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 (f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Mandiant Board (or a
committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until
5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th business day after the commencement of a tender or exchange
offer in connection with such acquisition proposal without such action being considered a violation
of the merger agreement);

statement (we refer to the actions described in these five bullets as a “Mandiant Board
recommendation change”); or
cause or permit Mandiant or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.
Other than in connection with an acquisition proposal, at any time prior to obtaining the requisite
stockholder approval, the Mandiant Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Mandiant Board
recommendation change in response to an intervening event if and only if:
the Mandiant Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
Mandiant has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance to the
effect that the Mandiant Board has (1) so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Mandiant Board
recommendation change, which notice will describe the intervening event in reasonable detail; and
prior to effecting such Mandiant Board recommendation change, Mandiant and its representatives,
until 5:00 p.m., Pacific time, at the end of such four business day period, have (1) negotiated with
Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make

consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal
constitutes a superior proposal; and (c) resolved to effect a Mandiant Board recommendation change

recommendation change or termination, including the identity of the person or group making such
acquisition proposal and the terms of such acquisition proposal and includes copies of all relevant
documents relating to such acquisition proposal; and (2) prior to effecting such Mandiant Board
recommendation change or termination, Mandiant and its representatives, until 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of the notice period, have (a) negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement and the transaction documents so that such acquisition proposal would cease to
constitute a superior proposal; and (b) permitted Parent and its representatives to make a

respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being understood
that (i) in the event of any change to the form or amount of consideration or any other material
revision, amendment, update or supplement to such acquisition proposal, Mandiant will be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of the merger agreement
with respect to such new written notice (with the “notice period” in respect of such new written
notice being three business days); and (ii) at the end of the notice period, the Mandiant Board must
have in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed
its determination that such bona fide written acquisition proposal is a superior proposal; and

benefits to our service providers (which we refer to as “Mandiant benefit plans”) will be honored in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. However,
subject to the below, Parent or the surviving corporation will be permitted to amend or terminate any such
Mandiant benefit plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable law.
We refer to each individual who is our employee or an employee of any of our subsidiaries immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger and continues to be an employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries
(including the surviving corporation) immediately following the effective time of the merger as a “continuing
employee.”
For one year following the effective time of the merger, each continuing employee generally will receive (i)
base salary and annual cash target bonus opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the base salary and annual cash target bonus opportunities provided to such continuing employee as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) health and welfare benefits that are substantially
similar to those health and welfare benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
subsidiaries. However, no defined benefit pension, post-retirement medical, equity-based, retention, change-
in-control, severance or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits provided to continuing
employees prior to the effective time of the merger will be taken into account for the foregoing.
Continuing employees generally will receive credit for all service with us and our subsidiaries prior to the
effective time of the merger and with Parent, the surviving corporation, and any of their subsidiaries on or
after the effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to
benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement) under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the
surviving corporation or the relevant subsidiary, as applicable (which we refer to as “new plans”), in which
such continuing employee becomes a participant. However, such recognition of service will not apply to the
extent it would result in the duplication of benefits or for purposes of: (A) any equity or equity-based plans
(including any entitlement to equity acceleration in connection with retirement); (B) for purposes of any plan
that provides retiree welfare benefits; (C) benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement pension plan benefits other than as required by
applicable law outside of the United States; or (D) any plan, program or arrangement under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or that is
grandfathered or frozen.
Additionally, with respect to each new plan that is an “employee welfare benefit plan”  (as that term is
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (other than the Mandiant benefit plans) for the purpose of providing
medical, surgical or hospital care or benefits for the benefit of any continuing employees, Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts so that generally (A) all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or
limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such new plan generally will be waived, and (B) any eligible expenses incurred by a
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the plan year that includes the closing date
of the merger will be given full credit pursuant to such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-
payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing

to) maintain in effect Mandiant’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger on terms (including with respect to
coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of Mandiant’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. In satisfying its obligations contemplated by the merger
agreement, the surviving corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300 percent
of the amount paid by Mandiant for coverage for its last full fiscal year (which we refer to as the “maximum
annual premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the maximum annual premium,
then the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding the maximum annual premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as Mandiant’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier.
Prior to the effective time of the merger and in lieu of maintaining the directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance mentioned above, Mandiant may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance so long as the annual cost for such tail policy does not exceed the maximum
annual premium. The surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) maintain
the tail policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the tail

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before
or after the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders (except as otherwise provided in the
merger agreement), in the following ways:
by mutual written agreement of Mandiant and Parent;
by either Mandiant or Parent if:
any Restraint has become final and non-appealable, except that the right to terminate will not be
available to any party whose action or failure constitutes a material breach of the merger
agreement and has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, such Restraint or in such
Restraint becoming final and non-appealable or failing to be removed;
the merger has not been consummated by 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on March 7, 2023 (which we
refer to as the “termination date”), subject to two automatic extensions to June 7, 2023 and
September 7, 2023, if certain conditions to closing are not met by these dates, except that a party
may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement and has been the primary
cause of, or primarily resulted in the failure of the effective time of the merger to have occured
prior to the termination date; or
our stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

subject to a 45-day cure period, Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any of its
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement
such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied (subject to Mandiant not being in
material breach of the merger agreement at the time of such termination); or
prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders: (1) Mandiant has received a
superior proposal; (2) the Mandiant Board (or a committee thereof) has authorized Mandiant to
enter into a definitive alternative acquisition agreement to consummate the acquisition
transaction contemplated by that superior proposal and Mandiant and the counterparties thereto
execute and deliver such definitive alternative acquisition agreement concurrently with or within
the first business day occurring on or after Mandiant’s termination of the merger agreement; (3)

subject to a 45-day cure period, Mandiant has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement such that
the related closing condition would not be satisfied (subject to Parent or Merger Sub not being
in material breach of the merger agreement at the time of such termination);
the Mandiant Board (or a committee thereof) (1) changes its recommendation with respect to the
merger, (2) Mandiant enters into an alternative acquisition agreement or (3) Mandiant has
committed a material and willful breach of its “no-shop” restrictions or covenants relating to its
stockholder meeting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger; or
if an order arising under any of the antitrust and FDI laws, or any antitrust and FDI laws, has
been issued, enacted, rendered, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by any
governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that will expressly impose a remedial action in
connection with the consummation of either the merger or the conversion of the convertible
preferred stock into common stock and the imposition of such remedial action shall have become
final and non-appealable, except Parent may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this
provision if Parent’s action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement
and has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the imposition of such remedial action
or in such remedial action becoming final and non-appealable or failing to be removed.
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the merger
agreement will be of no further force or effect and no party shall have any liability to the other parties (or any
equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate,
agent or other representative of such party), as applicable, except certain sections of the merger agreement
will survive the termination of the merger agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but subject to the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the
payment of termination fee and Parent termination fee (including that such fee when paid, in the
circumstances when the agreement is validly terminated and such fee is payable, is the sole and exclusive
remedy in respect of the merger agreement and the other transaction documents), nothing in the merger
agreement will relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach of the merger agreement prior to the
termination of the merger agreement or fraud or any party to any voting agreements from any liability for
breach of such voting agreement prior to the termination thereof. Furthermore, no termination of the merger
agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, which
rights, obligations and agreement will survive the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance

The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Mandiant and Parent. Upon valid termination of
the merger agreement under specified circumstances, Mandiant will be required to pay Parent (or its
designee) a termination fee of $197,000,000. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by Mandiant to
Parent if the merger agreement is terminated:
by Parent, if the Mandiant Board (or a committee thereof) changes its recommendation with respect to
the merger, Mandiant enters into an alternative acquisition agreement or Mandiant has committed a
material and willful breach of its “no-shop” restrictions or covenants relating to its stockholder
meeting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger; or
by Mandiant, if, prior to receiving the requisite stockholder approval, the Mandiant Board (or a
committee thereof) authorizes the acceptance of a superior proposal and Mandiant enters into a
definitive alternative acquisition agreement for the transaction contemplated by such superior
proposal.
The termination fee will also be payable in certain circumstances if:
the merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date;
(2) because of a failure to obtain the required approval of our stockholders; or (3) subject to a 45-day
cure period, because Mandiant breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or
covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied;

prior to such termination (but after the date of the merger agreement) an acquisition proposal is
publicly announced or publicly disclosed or delivered to the Mandiant Board and, in the case of a
termination for a failure to obtain the requisite approval of Mandiant’s stockholders, is not withdrawn
or otherwise abandoned at least one business day before such vote is taken; and
Mandiant subsequently consummates or enters into a definitive agreement providing for an
acquisition transaction that is subsequently consummated (or is terminated but a subsequent
acquisition transaction is subsequently consummated), in either case, within one year of such
termination.
Upon termination of the merger agreement under other specified circumstances, Parent will be required to
pay Mandiant a termination fee in the amount of (i) $328,000,000 if a termination notice is delivered on or
prior to 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on March 7, 2023, (ii) $394,000,000 if a termination notice is delivered at any
time after 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on March 7, 2023 but on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on June 7, 2023,
and (iii) $460,000,000 if a termination notice is delivered at any time after 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on June 7,
2023. Specifically, the termination fee will be payable by Parent to Mandiant if the merger agreement is
terminated:
by Parent or Mandiant if the merger is not completed by the termination date and at such time (a) the
closing conditions requiring (i) the receipt of certain antitrust and FDI clearances, (ii) the absence of
any law, injunction or order preventing, materially restraining or materially impairing the merger or the
conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock (arising as a result of antitrust and
FDI laws) and (iii) the absence of any order under any antitrust or FDI law and the absence of any
antitrust or FDI law enacted imposing certain remedial actions in connection with the merger or the
conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock, in each case, have not been
satisfied or waived (if a waiver is permitted by law); (b) such non-satisfaction is not primarily caused
by a material breach by Mandiant of the merger agreement; and (c) all other conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the merger under the merger agreement have been
satisfied or waived (if a waiver is permitted by law); or
(a) by Parent or Mandiant if a Restraint (if arising as a result of antitrust or FDI laws); or (b) by Parent
if an order under any antitrust or FDI law is in effect or any antitrust or FDI law has been enacted
imposing certain remedial actions in connection with the merger or the conversion of the convertible
preferred stock into common stock and at such time, in either case, has become final and non-
appealable (and a material breach by Mandiant is not the primary cause of such law, injunction or
order becoming final and non-appealable or failing to be removed or such remedial action being
imposed) and all of the other conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the
merger under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived (if a waiver is permitted by law).
The merger agreement also provides that Mandiant, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, may specifically enforce the obligations under the merger agreement.
Neither Parent nor Mandiant is required to pay to the other its termination fee on more than one occasion.
Mandiant’s receipt of the termination fee payable by Parent to the extent owed, and Mandiant’s right to
specific performance, are the sole and exclusive remedies of Mandiant, but in no event will Mandiant have a
right to both.",115,116

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC and the information is not
necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. In computing a person’s percentage
ownership of common stock, (a) shares of common stock subject to options or restricted stock units held by
that person that are currently exercisable, or exercisable (or, in the case of restricted stock units, scheduled
to vest and settle) within 60 days after April 6, 2022, and (b) shares of common stock into which shares of
convertible preferred stock are convertible, are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by that
person. None of these shares, however, are deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the
percentage ownership of any other person.
Except as indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting
and sole investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially owned, subject to community
property laws where applicable. For the percentage of beneficial ownership of common stock, we have based

If the merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in
any future meetings of our stockholders. However, if the merger is not completed, our stockholders will
continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
Mandiant will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2022 only if the merger has not already been
completed.
Stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at the
next annual meeting of stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing to our Secretary in a timely
manner. For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for our 2022 annual
meeting of stockholders, our Secretary must have received the written proposal at our principal executive
offices not later than December 28, 2021. In addition, stockholder proposals must comply with the
requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in
company-sponsored proxy materials. Stockholder proposals should be addressed to:
Mandiant, Inc. 
11951 Freedom Drive, 6th Floor 
Reston, VA 20190 
Attention: Corporate Secretary
Our bylaws also establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders who wish to present a proposal
before an annual meeting of stockholders but do not intend for the proposal to be included in our proxy
statement. Our bylaws provide that the only business that may be conducted at an annual meeting is
business that is (i) specified in our proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (ii) otherwise properly
brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Mandiant Board, or (iii) properly brought
before the annual meeting by a stockholder of record entitled to vote at the annual meeting who has
delivered timely written notice to our Secretary, which notice must contain the information specified in our
bylaws. To be timely for our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, our Secretary must have received the
written notice at our principal executive offices:
not earlier than February 11, 2022; and
not later than March 13, 2022.
In the event that we hold our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders more than 30 days before or more than 60
days after the first anniversary of the date of our annual meeting of the preceding year (which was held on
June 11, 2021), then notice of a stockholder proposal that is not intended to be included in our proxy
statement must be received no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before such annual
meeting and no later than the close of business on the later of the following two dates:
the 90th day prior to such annual meeting; or
the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is
first made.
If a stockholder who has notified us of his, her or its intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting
does not appear to present his, her or its proposal at such annual meeting, we are not required to present the
proposal for a vote at such annual meeting.

Annex B​
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
§ 262 Appraisal rights
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds
such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with
subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor
consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in
subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of
record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant
by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected
pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:
(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately
prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities
exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights
shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger
did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in
§ 251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof
are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
(a) Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;
(b) Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which
shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective
date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of
record by more than 2,000 holders;
(c) Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
(d) Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional
shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of
this section.
(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §
253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall
be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4) [Repealed.]
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its
B-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to
be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such
meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that
appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may
be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing
system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or
consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so
by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger
or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or
consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become
effective; or
(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title,
then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the
surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class
or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of
the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger
approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing
from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a
demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not
notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying
each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to
appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective
date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later
of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to
appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this
subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be
B-2 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to
receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not
more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close
of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and
who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding
as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled
to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded
stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and
accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for such a
statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value
of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The
Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing
of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the
stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in
the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices
by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.
(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class
or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a
national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who
are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds
1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger
was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall
accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled
to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the fmal determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is fmally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each
such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.
The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether
such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.
(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion
of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation
a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in
subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of
such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this
provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept
the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders
would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of
authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal

We further note that we also acted as bookrunner with respect to the offering by the Company of 0.875%

in accordance with their terms in connection with certain events, including the announcement or
consummation of the Transaction. In particular, under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, each of
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and the other counterparties, each acting separately as calculation agent under
the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain circumstances to make adjustments
to the exercise price of the embedded call options sold by the Company to Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and the
other counterparties to reflect the economic effect of the announcement of the Transaction on the Capped
Call Transactions. In its capacity as calculation agent, all actions or exercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs
& Co. LLC pursuant to the terms of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party must be performed in
good faith and a commercially reasonable manner.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to
stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended December 31, 2021;
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other
communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for
the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company (including a schedule of
expected net operating loss carryforwards by the Company), prepared by its management, as approved for
our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior
management of the Company regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential
benefits of, the Transaction and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared certain
financial and stock market information for the Company with similar financial and stock market information
for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain
recent business combinations in the software industry and in other industries; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy
and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to,
discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof.
In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We
have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent,
derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we
have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be
obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to
our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the
Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any
way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be
available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)
of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $23.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holderspursuant to the
Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of
the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by
the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including the fairness of the
Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or
class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $23.00 in cash per Share to
be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise.
We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time or, as to the
potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the
Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or
the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion

TABLE OF CONTENTS
is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or
reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our
advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the
Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion
does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such
Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs
& Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $23.00 in cash per
Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is
fair from a financial point of view to the holders of such Shares.
Very truly yours,

Section 6.10 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to

Stockholders, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand; and (ii) the specific performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance
with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any
right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

the State of Delaware.

CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

such reference shall be to an Article, Section or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The word “extent” and the
phrase “to the extent” when used in this Agreement shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such word or phrase shall not mean simply “if”. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. References in this Agreement to specific laws or to specific
provisions of laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any statute defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument referred to herein shall mean such statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor statutes. Each of
the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement.

or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail or through an Electronic

modification or waiver would not, either alone or in combination, result in a foreclosure or other Exercise of

perform its obligations and consummate the transactions as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. As
used herein, “Financing Agreements ” means those certain margin loan agreements entered into by the

or Section 5.3(d) of the Merger Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.
(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Affiliate” shall have the meaning assigned to it in the Merger
Agreement, but shall not include any entity whose equity securities are registered under the Exchange Act

representatives of any of the Stockholders serves as a member of its board of directors or similar governing
body, unless the Stockholders or their Affiliates otherwise control such entity. For purposes of this
Agreement, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed to be an

ARTICLE III 
CONVERSION
Section 3.1 Conversion.
(a) Each Stockholder that holds any Company Convertible Preferred Stock shall take all steps necessary,
including the submission, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, to the Company
of the Optional Conversion Notice (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) in the form of Exhibit A to
this Agreement, to convert all of such Stockholder’s Company Convertible Preferred Stock (whether New
Shares or Existing Shares), including all in-kind dividends that have accrued thereon through the date of
such conversion, into Company Common Stock at the Conversion Price (as defined in the Certificate of
Designations), with such conversion to be effective as of no later than the earlier of (x) immediately before
(and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective Time, and (y) immediately before any Exercise of Remedies
with respect to such Shares (the earlier of clauses (x) and (y), the “Conversion Deadline”), so that such
Stockholder shall not hold any Company Convertible Preferred Stock (or have any accrued dividends
relating thereto or any further rights to the accrual of any dividends relating thereto) from or after the
Conversion Deadline and so that the Company Common Stock into which such Convertible Preferred Stock
converts (including all in-kind dividends that have accrued thereon through the date of such conversion)
may be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration on and subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement. The Company hereby confirms that it will accept such Optional Conversion Notice set
forth in Exhibit A promptly upon its completion, execution and delivery to the Company, on and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any share of
Company Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time would be entitled
to be exchanged for a Fundamental Change Repurchase Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations)
as a result of the consummation of the Merger (it being agreed herein that the consummation of the Merger
would constitute a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Certificate of Designations)) that exceeds the
amount into which the shares of Company Common Stock, into which such share of Company Convertible
Preferred Stock would convert pursuant to this Section 3.1 and Exhibit A, then the parties to this Agreement
shall promptly amend this Agreement to provide for the repurchase, and cancelation, of such share of
Company Convertible Preferred Stock by the Company immediately before the Effective Time in exchange for
the payment, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, of the applicable Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement permits any Stockholder to convert
such Stockholder’s Company Convertible Preferred Stock (whether New Shares or Existing Shares)
(including all in-kind dividends that have accrued thereon through the date of such conversion) into
Company Common Stock in accordance with the Certificate of Designations at any time before the
Conversion Deadline.
(c) Any Shares delivered to the Stockholders upon conversion pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be delivered
on and subject to the applicable terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designations, as well as
the securities purchase agreements and registration rights agreements between the Company and such
Stockholder, as such agreements have been amended and “made available”  (as such term is used in the
Merger Agreement) to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. It is understood that, notwithstanding any
applicable legends or securities law or other restrictions on transferability, all shares of Company Common
Stock, into which shares of Company Convertible Preferred Stock (including all in-kind dividends that have
accrued thereon through the date of such conversion) have been converted as provided in Exhibit A and this
Section 3.1, shall be treated in the Merger as outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration on and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

party hereto. No assignment by any party hereto shall relieve such party hereto of any of its obligations
hereunder.

contractual relationship and is not intended to create, and does not create, any agency, partnership, joint
venture or any like relationship between the parties hereto.

herein, the Merger Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, undertakings, arrangements, representations and warranties,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Section 6.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
Section 6.10 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to

parties further agree to modify or replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the original economic, business and
other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
Section 6.11 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by
this Agreement or by applicable Law on such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including any party failing to take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of

enforcement is an integral part of this Agreement and without that right, neither the Stockholders nor Parent

other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Stockholders, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand; and (ii) the specific performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance
with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any
right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.
Section 6.12 Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware.
Section 6.13 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself, himself or herself or any of its, his or her properties or assets,

in accordance with Section 6.4 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in

applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself, himself or herself and its,
his or her properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement and the transactions

jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal
Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal
Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees
that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent and the Stockholders agrees that a
final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
Section 6.14 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS

parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.
Section 6.17 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Schedule,
such reference shall be to an Article, Section or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The word “extent” and the
phrase “to the extent” when used in this Agreement shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such word or phrase shall not mean simply “if”. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. References in this Agreement to specific laws or to specific
provisions of laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any statute defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument referred to herein shall mean such statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor statutes. Each of
the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 6.18 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments to this Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail or through an Electronic
Delivery will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered
to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version delivered in person. No party
may raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature, agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each party forever waives any such defense.

any matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of Law or breach of contract; or (ii) that such
information is material or is required to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement. Disclosure of
any information or document in the Company Disclosure Letter is not a statement or admission that it is
material or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter. Nothing in the Company
Disclosure Letter constitutes an admission against the Company’s interest or represents the Company’s
legal position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed. No reference in this Agreement to dollar amount
thresholds will be deemed to be evidence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable, or materiality.

amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement is not intended to imply that
such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material; and (ii) the inclusion of any specific
item in the Company Disclosure Letter is not intended to imply that such items are or are not material or
are within or outside of the ordinary course of business. In each case, no Party may use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Company Disclosure Letter
in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described in this Agreement is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement or whether any
obligation, item or matter included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement or is within or outside of the ordinary course of business.

inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance
with Section 9.4 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations
and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than
the Parties may not rely on the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

2.8 Equity Awards.
(a) Company Equity-Based Awards. Parent will not assume any Company Equity-Based Awards.
(i) Vested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, accelerate vesting in full (to the extent not already vested) and
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the
exercise or purchase price per share, if any, attributable to such Company Equity-Based Award) by
(y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Equity-Based
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount in cash, the “Company Equity-Based
Award Consideration”). The payment of the Company Equity-Based Award Consideration will be

A-23 TABLE OF CONTENTS
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise or purchase
price per share, if any, attributable to such Unvested Company RSU) by (y) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company RSUs (the “Unvested RSU
Consideration”), with such Unvested RSU Consideration vesting in accordance with the vesting
schedule applicable to such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time,
subject to Section 2.8(a)(vi). The vesting and payment of the Unvested RSU Consideration will also
be subject to the terms and conditions of the Unvested Payment Plan.
(iii) Other Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU other than as described in
Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(a)(ii) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
canceled for no consideration.
(iv) Company PSUs-Completed Performance. At the Effective Time, each Company PSU (including
any portion thereof) for which the performance period has been completed at or prior to the
Effective Time which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled and converted
into, and will become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the Per Share Price multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company PSU based on the actual achievement of all relevant performance goals
(the “Actual PSU Consideration”) with such Actual PSU Consideration vesting in accordance with
the service-based vesting schedule applicable to such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to Section 2.8(a)(vi). The vesting and payment of the Actual PSU

the avoidance of doubt, any Actual PSU Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 2.8(a)(iii)
will not be subject to any performance-based vesting requirements and will be subject solely to the
service-based vesting requirements applicable to the applicable Company PSU as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
(v) Company PSUs-Uncompleted Performance. At the Effective Time, each Company PSU
(including any portion thereof) for which the performance period has not been completed at or prior

converted into the right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x)
the Per Share Price multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company PSU assuming maximum level of achievement of all relevant performance goals
(the “Unvested PSU Consideration”), with such Unvested PSU Consideration vesting in accordance
with the service-based vesting schedule applicable to such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to Section 2.8(a)(vi). The vesting and payment of the Unvested PSU
Consideration will also be subject to the terms and conditions of the Unvested Payment Plan. For

the service-based vesting requirements applicable to the applicable Company PSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(vi) Acceleration. The Unvested RSU Consideration, Actual PSU Consideration, and Unvested
PSU Consideration will be treated as a Company Equity-Based Award for the purposes of any
double-trigger accelerated vesting applicable with respect to the underlying Company RSU or
Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, which such double-trigger accelerated
vesting provision is disclosed on Section 3.19(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(b) Company Options. Parent will not assume any Company Options. At the Effective Time, each
Company Option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, accelerate vesting in
full and be cancelled and converted into, and will become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the
exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option) by (ii) the total number of shares
A-24 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (such amount in
cash, the “Company Option Consideration”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any
Company Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Options is equal
to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company Options will be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of the Company Option Consideration will be
subject to withholding for all required Taxes.
(c) Payment Procedures. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Company or its designee, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the aggregate (i) Company Equity-Based Award Consideration owed to all holders of Vested
Company RSUs; and (ii) Company Option Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options. As
soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event later than the second regular payroll
period following the Closing Date), the applicable holders of Vested Company RSUs and Company
Options will receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll
system or payroll provider, or from the Company’s or Surviving Corporation’s designee of all amounts
required to be paid to such holders in respect of Vested Company RSUs or Company Options that are
cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Vested Company RSUs or Company Options pursuant
to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable, is not made through the Company’s or the Surviving
Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation or its designee will
wire or issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent to such holder promptly
following the Closing Date (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter).
(d) Necessary Further Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company or the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof), as applicable, will take all action necessary to effect the cancellation of
Company Equity-Based Awards and Company Options as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this
Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act). All Company Equity-Based Awards and Company Options and all Company Equity Plans
will terminate as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), and the
provisions in any other Company Benefit Plan or Contract providing for the issuance or grant of any
other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be cancelled as of
the Effective Time.
(e) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company or the
Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof), as applicable, will take all action necessary to (i)
cause any offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that is outstanding on the date of this
Agreement and otherwise would be outstanding at the Effective Time to be terminated no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; (ii) make any adjustments that may be necessary or
advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or
purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP;
(iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP on or
after the Closing Date; and (v) provide that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each
participant under the ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP
(as amended pursuant to this Section 2.8(e)), be refunded in cash to such participant as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (without interest). On such exercise date, the Company will
apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the
purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the
Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment
A-25 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. On the Closing Date or on the first (1 ) Business Day following the Closing Date,
Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company
Common Stock are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange
Fund”). To the extent that the Exchange Fund is insufficient at any time for any reason for the Payment
Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7, then Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated
by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to
mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in such form as Parent
may reasonably provide and which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent; and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment
Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, in
accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be
entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent
will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable)
an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price. The Certificate so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
any holder of the Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not
be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to
receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary
form (it being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have
surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such other
evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to
receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as

receive the consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting
Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration paid in accordance with the terms

equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share
Price. The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept
transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of
Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be
paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.7 may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if
such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent
(or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be
made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.
(e) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment
Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to
the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after
the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for
payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.
2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all
shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and
cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously representing any
shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting
Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration paid in accordance with the terms
of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving

Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such amount as it may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
2.12 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any applicable Laws related to Taxes. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.
2.13 Future Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.
2.14 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

promulgated by the SEC. As of the date of this Agreement, Deloitte & Touche LLP has not resigned (or
informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as the independent registered public
accounting firm of the Company.
(b) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains “disclosure
controls and procedures” and “internal control over financial reporting”  (in each case as defined
pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act). The Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and such assessment concluded that such
system was effective. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued (and
not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2021. Since December 31, 2021, and through the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no events have occurred such that management would not be able to complete its assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, and
conclude, after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since the Lookback Date, the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have each made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal
financial officer has received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications.
(c) Internal Controls. The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls that are effective in all material respects in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
including policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the

extent applicable, the Company has made available, or, solely with respect to clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (v), (vi)
and (viii), will make available no more than five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, to Parent

compliance documents required to be filed with any Governmental Authority with respect to such
International Employee Plan; and (2) any document comparable to the determination or opinion letter

Qualified Plan (i) may rely on a prototype opinion letter or has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS (or such other applicable Governmental Authority with respect to any International
Employee Plan that is a Qualified Plan) to such effect and nothing has occurred or exists since the date
of such determination or opinion letter that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Qualified Plan or (ii) has a period of time remaining under
applicable Treasury Regulations, IRS pronouncements or similar regulation by a foreign Governmental
Authority in which to apply for such a letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a

administration or operation of such plans, other than routine claims for benefits that have been or are
being handled through an administrative claims procedure and (ii) no Company Benefit Plan is under
audit or is the subject of an audit or investigation by the IRS, the DOL, the SEC, the PBGC or any other
Governmental Authority (and the Company has not received written notice of any such audit or
investigation) nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is any such audit or investigation threatened or
anticipated with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

Subsidiaries, any fiduciary or administrator of any Company Benefit Plan or, to the Knowledge of the

Company Benefit Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-exempt “prohibited transaction”  (as defined
in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition of a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed by Section 4975
of the Code, in each case applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit
Plan, or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification obligation.
(g) No Welfare Benefit Plan. Except as has not been and would not be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no Company Benefit Plan that is a
“welfare benefit plan”  (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (whether or not subject to ERISA) provides
post-termination or retiree life insurance, health or other welfare benefits to any person, except as may
be required by Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law, the full cost of which is borne by the
employee or former employee (or any of their beneficiaries).

due to any such Service Provider, (iii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting, or funding or increase the
amount of compensation due any such Service Provider, (iv) trigger any funding or other obligation

Company Benefit Plan (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any “disqualified
individual”  (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that could, individually or
in combination with any other such payment, constitute an “excess parachute payment”  (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No Company Benefit Plan provides for, and none of the Company nor
any of its Affiliates is a party to a Contract that provides for, or is otherwise obligated to provide, any
gross-up, additional payment or reimbursement of Taxes under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code or
otherwise.
(i) Section 409A. Each Company Benefit Plan is in all material respects in material compliance (both
operationally and documentarily) with Section 409A of the Code. No assets set aside for the payment of
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan that is or was a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
subject to Section 409A of the Code (a “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan”) are held outside of the
United States, except to the extent that substantially all of the services to which such benefits are
attributable have been performed in the jurisdiction in which such assets are held, and otherwise no
arrangement exists with respect to a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan that would result in
income inclusion under Section 409A(b) of the Code.
(j) International Employee Plans. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each International Employee
Plan has been established, maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with its
terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any applicable Laws, including making all
required filings and reports in a timely manner with all Governmental Authorities, (ii) no event has
occurred with respect to any registered International Employee Plan which would result in the
revocation of the registration of such International Employee Plan, or which would entitle any Person
(without the consent of the sponsor of such International Employee Plan) to wind up or terminate any
such International Employee Plan, in whole or in part, or could otherwise reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on the tax status of any such International Employee Plan and (iii) no
contribution holidays have been taken under any of the International Employee Plans, and there have
been no withdrawals of assets or transfers from any International Employee Plan, except in accordance
with applicable Laws. No debt has arisen under Section 75 of the U.K. Pension Act 1995 in connection
with any International Employee Plan, nor will any such debt become due as a result of the
consummation of the Merger. No employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is domiciled
outside of the United States (or any of their dependents) is entitled to any pension, superannuation,
retirement (including on early retirement), or death benefits (including in the form of a lump sum)
(together, “Pension Benefits”) that become payable before such employee’s normal retirement age as
stated in his or her contract of employment or such International Employee Plan itself. With respect to
each International Employee Plan, (A) apart from any general indemnity in favor of the trustees given by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the governing documents of such International Employee
Plan, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not given any indemnity, undertaking or guarantee in
respect of such International Employee Plan, (B) the financial statements of such International
Employee Plan accurately reflect such International Employee Plan’s liabilities and accruals for
contributions required to be paid to such International Employee Plan, in accordance with applicable
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and (C) the assets of each International
Employee Plan that provide Pension Benefits are sufficient to satisfy its respective liabilities (current
and contingent) as of the date of this Agreement. No International Employee Plan has material unfunded
liabilities that as of the Effective Time will not be fully accrued for in its financial statements or fully
offset by insurance.

or confidentiality agreement to the extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a
confidential proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof) if the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) has determined that a failure to refrain from such enforcement or a failure
to grant such waiver would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable Law; and (ii) the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly
or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives (including the Company Financial Advisor),
following the execution and delivery of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (A) participate or

good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (I) such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would be reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (II) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(b)(ii) would

requests in writing) (it being understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) will not
be obligated to affirm the Company Board Recommendation more than once per material event (but
that any material change to such material event will constitute a new material event for purposes of
this parenthetical)); (D) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make and maintain
any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a publicly disclosed
recommendation against such offer or the issuance of a “stop, look and listen” communication by

action described in clauses (A) through (E), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”), it being
understood that none of (1) the determination, in and of itself, by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would be reasonably likely to lead
to, a Superior Proposal; (2) the delivery, in and of itself, by the Company to Parent and its
Representatives of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(d); or (3) the public disclosure, in and
of itself, of the items in clauses (1) and (2) if and to the extent required by applicable Law (provided
that such public disclosure under this clause (3) specifies, without qualification, that the Company
Board continues to maintain the Company Board Recommendation at such time), will constitute a
Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.3; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(d) Permissible Company Board Recommendation Change and Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(i) Intervening Events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, other than in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
in response to an Intervening Event if and only if:
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days
in advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so determined and (B) resolved
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i),
which notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, until 5:00 p.m. at the end of such four Business Day period, have (A)
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that the Company Board no longer
determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (B) permitted Parent
and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests
to make such a presentation).
(ii) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such
Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(i), in each case, if and only if:
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days

good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

include copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the
Company and its Representatives, until 5:00 p.m. on the last day of the Notice Period,
have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that
Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that such Acquisition Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives
to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a
presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any change to the form or
amount of consideration or any other material revision, amendment, update or supplement
to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d)(ii)(4) with
respect to such new written notice (with the “Notice Period” in respect of such new
written notice being three (3) Business Days); and (b) at the end of the Notice Period, the
Company Board must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
(e) Notice to Parent. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if an Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry about making an offer, indication of interest or proposal relating to an Acquisition
Proposal is received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or

proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company
or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or Group making

keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of any change to the form
or amount consideration or any other material terms specified in such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request).
(f) Permitted Disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange

providing Parent access to such Contract under the terms of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement would expose the Company to an unreasonable risk of liability; provided, that with respect

Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) provide to each Continuing Employee, for so long as such Continuing Employee
remains employed by Parent, its Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, (i) base salary and annual
cash target bonus opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the base salary
and annual cash target bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) health and welfare benefits that are substantially similar to those
health and welfare benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent

or its Subsidiaries, as determined by Parent; provided, however, that no defined benefit pension, post-
retirement medical, equity-based, retention, change-in-control, severance or other special or non-
recurring compensation or benefits provided prior to the Closing Date shall be taken into account for
purposes of this covenant.
(c) New Plans.
(i) At or after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any other
Subsidiary of Parent to, use commercially reasonable efforts to the extent permitted by the terms of
Parent’s existing benefit plans and applicable Law, provide that each Continuing Employee receives
credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement) under each of
the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable (“New Plans”), in which such Continuing Employee
becomes a participant and in each case subject to the applicable information being provided to
Parent in a form that Parent reasonably determines in its sole discretion is administratively feasible
to take into account under its plans; except that such recognition of service will not apply (A) for
purposes of any equity or equity-based plans (including any entitlement to equity acceleration in
connection with retirement); (B) for purposes of any plan that provides retiree welfare benefits; (C)
for purposes of benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan
or plan providing post-retirement pension plan benefits other than as required by applicable Law in
non-US jurisdictions; (D) to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits; or
(E) for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (1) under which similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (2) that is grandfathered or
frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation.
(ii) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to each New Plan
that is an “employee welfare benefit plan”  (as that term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (other
than the Company Benefit Plans) for the purpose of providing for such plan’s participants or their
beneficiaries, medical, surgical or hospital care or benefits for the benefit of any Continuing
Employees, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to the extent permitted by such New Plan and applicable Law,
to cause (A) all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination
requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in such plan, was subject to such
conditions under the comparable Company Benefit Plan, and (B) any eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the plan year that includes
the Closing Date to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, subject to the applicable
information being provided to Parent in a form that Parent reasonably determines in its sole
discretion is administratively feasible to take into account under its plans.
(d) Qualified Plans. Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date to the contrary, the Company Board shall adopt resolutions
providing that no rights to contributions will accrue after, and that each Qualified Plan and each
Company Benefit Plan that is a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code shall be
terminated, as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (but conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Closing). The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith prior to the Closing with respect to
the preparation and execution of all documentation necessary to effect the foregoing termination, and
the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all such
documentation. To the extent that any Qualified Plans or cafeteria plan is terminated pursuant to
Parent’s

request, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan or cafeteria plan (as
applicable) maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date.

comments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.10(f), the Company may issue

event later than twenty (20) days following the date of this Agreement, with respect to each “officer” of
the Company (as defined in Rule 16a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (each a “Section 16
Officer”) and any other “disqualified individual” of the Company (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code), the Company shall furnish to Parent a schedule that sets forth (i) the Company’s reasonable,
good faith estimate of the maximum amount (separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts
and any tax gross-up payments) that could be paid to such Section 16 Officer or other disqualified
individual as a result of the Merger (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the “base
amount”  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such Section 16 Officer or other
disqualified individual, and (iii) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, underlying documentation
on which such calculations are based. The Company and Parent agree to use best efforts to cooperate

(b) Effect of Termination. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be

written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties, as applicable. Following the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect, and no Party
(or any equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer,
employee, Affiliate, agent or other Representative of such Party) shall have any liability to the other
Party(ies) (or any equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director,

subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, that Parent’s reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section
6.7, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX will each survive the termination of this Agreement, in
each case in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but
subject to Section 8.3, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for Willful
Breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement or Fraud or any party to

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and
expenses whether or not the Merger and the other Transactions are consummated. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment
Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(d), Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and
documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in
each case arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and the other Transactions.
(b) Company Payments.
(i) Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
(Termination Date) (and in the case of such termination under Section 8.1(c), the Parent Termination
Fee is not payable), Section 8.1(d) (No Vote) or Section 8.1(e) (Company Breach); (B) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed or delivered to the
Company Board and, in the case of a termination under Section 8.1(d) (No Vote), such Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned at least one Business Day before such vote is
taken on the adoption of this Agreement; and (C) within one year of such termination, either an
Acquisition Transaction (which need not be the Acquisition Transaction referenced under clause
(B)) is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the
consummation of an Acquisition Transaction (which need not be the Acquisition Transaction
referenced under clause (B)) and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated (or is
subsequently terminated before consummation but a subsequent Acquisition Transaction is
entered into in connection with the termination of such Acquisition Transaction and such
subsequent Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated), then the Company will,
concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to
Parent or its designee an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Parent or its designee. For purposes of
this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction”
will be deemed to be references to “50 percent.”
(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) (Change of Recommendation), then the Company must, within two (2)
Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Parent or its designee.
(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(i) (Superior Proposal), then the Company must, prior to or concurrently with (and as a condition
to the effectiveness of) such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Parent or its designee.
(c) Parent Payments. If this Agreement is validly terminated:
(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (Termination Date) and, as of the time of
such termination, (A) the conditions set forth in at least one of Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c) (if
such Restraint arises as a result of an Antitrust and Foreign Investment Law) or Section 7.2(e) shall
have not have been satisfied or waived; (B) a material breach by the Company of this Agreement
has not been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, one or more of the conditions in Section
7.1(b), Section 7.1(c) (if such Restraint arises as a result of an Antitrust and Foreign
A-84 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Investment Law) or Section 7.2(e) to not be satisfied; and (C) all other conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived (or, in the case of those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, such conditions are capable of being satisfied
if the Closing were to occur); or
(ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (Nonappealable Restraint) (if such
Restraint arises as a result of an Antitrust and Foreign Investment Law) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) (Nonappealable Remedy Action), and, as of the time of such termination, (A) a
material breach by the Company of this Agreement has not been the primary cause of, or primarily
resulted in, such Restraint or such imposition of such Remedy Action as specified in Section 8.1(b)
or Section 8.1(g); and (B) all conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c) (if such Restraint arises as a result of an Antitrust and Foreign
Investment Law) or Section 7.2(e)) have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) waived (or, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, such conditions are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur);
then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company or the Company’s designee(s), (A) if
such termination notice is delivered on or prior to 11:59 p.m. on March 7, 2023, an amount equal to
$328,000,000, (B) if such termination notice is delivered at any time after 11:59 p.m. on March 7, 2023
but on or prior to 11:59 p.m. on June 7, 2023, an amount equal to $394,000,000 and (C) if such
termination notice is delivered at any time after 11:59 p.m. on June 7, 2023, an amount equal to
$460,000,000 (any fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(c), the “Parent Termination Fee”). If the
termination that triggers the payment under this Section 8.3(c) is by the Company, then Parent
must, within two (2) Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the
Company or its designee the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated by the Company or its designee. If the termination that triggers the
payment under this Section 8.3(c) is by Parent, then Parent must, concurrently with such
termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its designee the Parent Termination Fee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by the Company or its
designee.
(d) Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee, or Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will
not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Related Parties (in the case of payment of the Company Termination
Fee) or the Company and the Company Related Parties (in the case of payment of the Parent Termination
Fee) in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
(e) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 and the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable, then Parent’s receipt of the
Company Termination Fee, or the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be,
will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties
or of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties, respectively, in respect of this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the Merger.
