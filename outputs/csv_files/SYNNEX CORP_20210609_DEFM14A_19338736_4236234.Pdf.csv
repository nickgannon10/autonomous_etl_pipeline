In connection with the Merger, SYNNEX retained Duff & Phelps, LLC (which we refer to as “Duff & Phelps”) to serve as an independent financial
advisor to the Board (solely in their capacity as members of the Board) specifically to provide to the Board a fairness opinion in connection with the
acquisition by SYNNEX of Tech Data for consideration paid to Tech Data’s stockholder consisting of $1.61 billion in cash and 44.0 million shares of
SYNNEX common stock. On March 16, 2021, Duff & Phelps delivered its opinion, dated March 16, 2021 (which we refer to as the “Opinion”), to the
Board that, as of the date of the Opinion and subject to and based on the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, limitations of
the review undertaken and qualifications contained in such Opinion, the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to SYNNEX and its stockholders (without giving effect to any impact of the proposed Merger on any particular stockholder other than
in its capacity as a stockholder).
The full text of the Opinion is attached hereto as Annex F and is incorporated into this document by reference. The summary of the Opinion set
forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Opinion. The Opinion should be read carefully and in its entirety for a
discussion of the procedures followed, assumptions made, other matters considered and limits of the review undertaken by Duff & Phelps in
connection with such Opinion, as well as the qualifications contained therein.
As compensation for Duff & Phelps’ services in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Board, SYNNEX agreed to pay Duff & Phelps a
fee of $600,000. The fee was payable upon Duff & Phelps informing the Board that it was prepared to deliver its opinion. No portion of Duff &
Phelps’ fee is refundable or contingent upon the completion of the Merger or the conclusion reached in its opinion.

If the Share Issuance Proposal and the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal are not approved by the holders of shares of SYNNEX
common stock or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the Merger Agreement will be void and have no effect, and there will not be
any liability or obligation on the part of any party, except that:
 
 
•
 no termination will relieve any party from liability for any material breach or failure to perform that is the consequence of an act or
omission of such party with the knowledge that such act or omission would cause a material breach of the Merger Agreement (a
“Willful Breach”);
 
 
•
 no termination will affect the obligations of the parties contained in the confidentiality agreement between them; and

•
 certain other provisions of the Merger Agreement, including provisions with respect to the allocation of fees and expenses, including,
if applicable, the termination fees described below, will survive such termination.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, SYNNEX is required to pay Tiger Parent a termination fee of either
$131,683,200, $86,275,200 or $40,867,200, and in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated because the approval of SYNNEX’ stockholders shall
not have been obtained, SYNNEX is required to reimburse Tiger Parent for their reasonable fees, costs and other expenses directly related to the
Merger. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”",14,15

Under the Merger Agreement, the respective obligations of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent to complete the Merger are subject to, among other things,
(i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof, including any agreement between a party to the Merger Agreement
and a governmental authority agreeing not to consummate the Merger prior to a certain date) applicable to the completion of the Merger under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”) (together, such expiration or termination we refer to as
the “HSR Act Clearance”) and (ii) the making of and receipt of, certain other specified regulatory filings and consents (which we refer to as the
“required filings” and “required consents”).
On April 2, 2021, SYNNEX and Tiger Parent filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger with
the FTC and DOJ, which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. At the end of the initial 30-day waiting period, SYNNEX pulled and re-
filed its notification and report form under the HSR Act, with the consent of Tiger Parent, to allow the FTC and DOJ an additional 30 days to review
the Merger. This additional 30-day period expired on June 4, 2021. Additionally, the Merger has received clearance for some of the non-U.S.
regulatory filings, while other non-U.S. regulatory clearances remain outstanding.

Consideration will have been authorized for listing on the NYSE, (iii) the HSR Act Clearance and other required regulatory approvals will have been

SYNNEX CORP_20210609_DEFM14A_19338736_4236234.Pdf,Financing,"Financing (see page 74)
SYNNEX anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to directly or indirectly pay, repay, refinance, or repurchase, as applicable, certain
existing of its and Tech Data’s indebtedness (including indebtedness of their
 
5Table of Contents
respective subsidiaries) will be approximately $1,185 million. These amounts will be funded through some or all of (i) the term loan portion of the
takeout facility (defined below), (ii) cash on hand and (iii) the proceeds that SYNNEX intends to obtain from other financings or offerings of debt
securities in lieu of borrowing under the Tranche C of the Bridge Facility (as defined below). Remaining amounts under the takeout facility will be
used for general corporate purposes.
To provide the debt financing required by SYNNEX to consummate the Merger, SYNNEX entered into:
(1) a commitment letter dated March 22, 2021 (which, as it may be amended from time to time, we refer to as the “Bridge Commitment Letter”), under
which Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (which we refer to as “Citi”) and certain other financing institutions joining thereto pursuant to the terms
thereof committed to provide $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured term bridge loans and $3.5 billion in aggregate principal
amount of senior unsecured revolving credit commitments, the availability of which was and is subject to reduction upon the consummation of the
Permanent Financing (as defined below) pursuant to the terms set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter (which we refer to as the “Bridge Facility”).
The Bridge Facility originally consisted of three different tranches of senior unsecured loans: the first tranche (which we refer to as “Tranche A”)
was for a $1.5 billion senior unsecured term loan; the second tranche (which we refer to as “Tranche B”) was for a $3.5 billion senior unsecured
revolving credit facility; and the third tranche (which we refer to as “Tranche C”) is for a $2.5 billion senior unsecured term loan. On April 16, 2021,
SYNNEX entered into the takeout facility and pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Commitment Letter, the commitments with respect to Tranche A
and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility were reduced to zero. As a result of the termination of both Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility, only
Tranche C of the Bridge Facility remains outstanding and the debt financing that was previously committed to under Tranche A and Tranche B of the
Bridge Facility will instead be provided under the takeout facility; and
(2) a credit agreement dated April 16, 2021, the loans and commitments to be provided thereunder (which we collectively refer to as the “takeout
facility”) and the related underlying documentation in respect thereof (which we refer to as the “New Credit Agreement”), with Citibank, N.A., as
agent, and the other lenders party thereto, pursuant to which SYNNEX has received commitments for the extension of a senior unsecured revolving
credit facility not to exceed an aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion, which revolving credit facility may, subject to the lenders’ discretion,
potentially be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $500 million and for the extension of a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. The commitments under the takeout facility are subject to customary closing conditions. The borrower under the
takeout facility is SYNNEX.
At this time, SYNNEX has not yet determined whether Tranche C of the Bridge Facility will be required to be utilized in conjunction with the takeout
facility to provide the debt financing required to refinance certain indebtedness required to consummate the proposed transactions because such
determination will be dependent on future market conditions. SYNNEX intends to obtain additional financing or issue debt securities in lieu of
utilizing Tranche C of the Bridge Facility; however, there is no assurance that such alternative arrangements will be available on acceptable terms or
at all. If Tranche C of the Bridge Facility is utilized there can be no assurance that any replacement or supplemental financing in lieu of or to refinance
Tranche C of the Bridge Facility will be available to SYNNEX on acceptable terms or at all. SYNNEX’ ability to obtain additional debt financing,
including financing to refinance, replace or supplement Tranche C of the Bridge Facility, will be subject to various factors, including market
conditions and operating performance.
The funding under either the Bridge Commitment Letter or the takeout facility, as applicable, is subject to customary closing conditions, including
conditions that do not relate directly to the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement.
Until the earlier of the closing or the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance therewith, SYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
 
6
Table of Contents
advisable and proper in connection with the arrangement, marketing and consummation of the issuance of any debt securities and/or the incurrence
of any other long-term debt financing by SYNNEX that is reasonably acceptable to SYNNEX and Tiger Parent in lieu of the Financing (which debt
securities and/or other long-term debt financing we refer to herein as the “Permanent Financing”). Furthermore, in the event any funds required to
satisfy the transaction uses become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (defined below) or the
financing agreements, SYNNEX has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain additional funds (which we refer to as the “Alternative
Financing”) in an amount sufficient to allow it to satisfy the transaction uses, and to obtain a new financing commitment that provides for such
funds on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to SYNNEX and Tiger Parent (which we refer to as the “Alternative Commitment Letter”, and
together with the Bridge Commitment Letter, as the context may require, the “Commitment Letter”). The debt financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter is referred to herein as the “Financing”.

As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the Merger Agreement, each of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent mutually agreed to immediately
cease discussions or negotiations with any other person that may have been ongoing prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, with respect to
any alternative acquisition proposal of SYNNEX or Tiger Parent, as applicable, and to request the return or destruction of any confidential
information previously delivered to any such person.

directly or indirectly:

 initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any alternative acquisition
proposal;
 
 
•
 engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any alternative acquisition proposal;

alternative acquisition proposal; or
 
 
•
 approve or enter into any acquisition agreement, term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other similar agreement
in connection with or relating to any alternative acquisition proposal (unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated).
If, prior to the receipt of SYNNEX’ stockholder approval, SYNNEX receives a bona fide written alternative acquisition proposal not solicited in
violation of its non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX may furnish confidential or nonpublic information to, and
participate in such negotiations or discussions with, the person making the alternative acquisition proposal, if the Board concludes in good faith,
after consulting with such outside advisors as it determines in good faith to be reasonably necessary, that taking such actions would be required to
comply with its fiduciary duties. Before furnishing any confidential or nonpublic information, SYNNEX shall enter into a confidentiality agreement
with the person making such alternative acquisition proposal that contains terms substantially no less favorable than the confidentiality agreement
between SYNNEX and Tiger Parent (provided that such confidentiality agreement shall not give such person with any exclusive right to negotiate
with SYNNEX, and shall otherwise permit SYNNEX to comply with its obligations under the Merger Agreement).

•
 any legal restraint, including the denial of any required regulatory approval, is in effect that has become final and nonappealable, except

benefit thereof except for closing conditions regarding the existence of a legal restraint or HSR Act Clearance or a required regulatory
approval, a party may extend the outside date to March 22, 2022, and if such circumstances continue to exist on such extended outside
date, a party may then further extend the outside date to June 22, 2022, except that no party may extend the outside date as described in
this bullet point if the failure of the Merger to occur on or by the outside date was principally caused by such party’s failure to perform
or observe any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 if the other party has breached any of the obligations, covenants or agreements, or representations or warranties of the other party,
such that if that breach was in effect as of the closing, the other party would not be able to satisfy it closing conditions described
under “—Conditions to the Merger” and the other party has not cured such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of the
breach from the terminating party, except that no party may terminate the Merger Agreement as described in this bullet point if it is then
in material breach of any of its obligations, covenants or other agreements under the Merger Agreement; or
 
 
•
 SYNNEX’ stockholders fail to approve the Share Issuance Proposal and the Authorized Share Charter Amendment at the special
meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on such proposals and matters is taken.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by Tiger Parent at any time prior to receipt of SYNNEX’ stockholder approval, if SYNNEX has made a
change of recommendation as described under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements—Change of
Recommendation;” or SYNNEX has committed a Willful Breach of certain of its non-solicitation obligations.

SYNNEX CORP_20210609_DEFM14A_19338736_4236234.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting of stockholders
and the Merger. These questions and answers do not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of SYNNEX. Please refer to
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the Annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this
proxy statement.
 
Q:
What is the Merger?
 
A:
On March 22, 2021, SYNNEX entered into the Merger Agreement with Tiger Parent, Merger Sub I, and Merger Sub II. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. The Merger Agreement contains the terms and conditions of the proposed acquisition
of Tiger Parent by SYNNEX. Under the Merger Agreement, subject to satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement and described hereinafter, Merger Sub I will merge with and into Tiger Parent, with Tiger Parent surviving the
Corporate Merger. Promptly following the Corporate Merger, Tiger Parent will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving the
LLC Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX. Such Corporate Merger and LLC Merger are referred to collectively as the “Merger”. The
Merger is intended to be considered together as a single integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and to qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
 
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 
A:
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board with respect to the Merger and other matters to be
considered at the special meeting. These materials will help you decide how to vote your shares of common stock with respect to the matters
related to the Merger to be considered at the special meeting.
SYNNEX is holding a virtual special meeting of its stockholders to vote on the proposals necessary to complete the Merger. Information about the
special meeting, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other business to be considered by stockholders at the special meeting is contained in
this proxy statement.
 
Q:
What will Tiger Parent’s stockholder receive in the Merger?
 
A:
If the Merger is completed, Tiger Holdings, as sole holder of shares of Tiger Parent’s common stock, will be entitled to receive $1.61 billion in cash
($1.11 billion in cash after giving effect to the $500 million equity contribution by Tiger Holdings to Tiger Parent prior to the Effective Time) and
44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock. Following the completion of the Merger, SYNNEX’ stockholders prior to the Merger will hold
approximately 55% of outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, and Tiger Holdings will hold approximately 45% of outstanding shares of
SYNNEX common stock. The SYNNEX common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will not be registered under the Securities Act
and will be issued in reliance on the exemption from registration requirements thereof provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a
transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. SYNNEX is required to, within two business days after the closing of the Merger, file an
automatically effective registration statement registering the resale of such shares. For further information, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Merger Consideration.”
 
Q:
How will SYNNEX pay the cash component of the Merger consideration?
 
A:
SYNNEX’ obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned upon obtaining financing. $1.61 billion, less $500 million equity contributed by Tiger
Holdings before closing will be paid from a combination of cash and/or debt raised as part of the debt offering immediately prior to the closing.
 
10Table of Contents
Q:
What equity stake will Tiger Parent’s stockholder hold in SYNNEX immediately following the Merger?
 
A:
Upon the completion of the Merger, the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock issuable as a portion of the Merger Consideration will be
44 million shares, which will result in Tiger Holdings, as sole holder of shares of Tiger Parent’s common stock, holding approximately 45% of the
outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock of SYNNEX as of June 8, 2021.
For more details on the calculation of Merger consideration, see “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.”
 
Q:
When and where will the special meeting of stockholders be held?
 
A:
The special meeting of SYNNEX’ stockholders will be held via live webcast on June 30, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time. In order to attend the
meeting, you must register at https://viewproxy.com/synnex/2021sm/htype.asp by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on June 27, 2021. On the day of the
special meeting, if you have properly registered, you may enter the meeting by clicking on the link provided and the password you received via
email in your registration confirmations. SYNNEX’ stockholders will be able to listen, vote and submit questions during the virtual meeting
 
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 
A:
Only holders of record of SYNNEX common stock as of the close of business on June 8, 2021, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to
notice of and to vote at the special meeting. You will be entitled to one vote on each of the proposals presented in this proxy statement for each
share of SYNNEX common stock that you held as of the close of business on the record date.
 
Q:
What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?
 
A:
At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:
 
 
•
 a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger;
 
 
•
 a proposal to adopt an amendment to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares;
 
 
•
 a proposal to adopt an amendment to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation to waive the corporate opportunity doctrine with respect to
certain directors and certain other parties; and
 
 
•
 a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies.
 
Q:
What vote is required to approve each of the proposals?
 
A:
For the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board is requesting the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of SYNNEX common stock (meaning that of the outstanding shares of common stock, a majority of them be voted “for” the proposal). Abstentions
and failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The proposal to approve an issuance of an aggregate of 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger requires,
assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of SYNNEX common stock present at the special meeting, whether via
the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on such matter (meaning that of the shares represented at the
 
1
1
Table of Contents
meeting and entitled to vote, a majority of them must be voted “for” the proposal for it to be approved). Abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Share Issuance Proposal, but a failure to vote or otherwise be present at the special meeting will have no effect on the Share
Issuance Proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
The proposal to adopt an amendment to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock (meaning that of the outstanding shares of
common stock, a majority of them must be voted “for” the proposal for it to be approved). Abstentions and failure to vote will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal.
The proposal to adopt an amendment to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, pursuant to which SYNNEX shall waive the corporate
opportunity doctrine with respect to certain directors and certain other parties requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock (meaning that of the outstanding shares of common stock, a majority of them must be voted “for”
the proposal for it to be approved). Abstentions and failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Corporate Opportunity
Charter Amendment Proposal.
The proposal to approve an adjournment to the special meeting if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of
SYNNEX common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on
such matter. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the shares
of SYNNEX common stock present, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on such matter may
adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal, but a
failure to vote or otherwise be present at the special meeting will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
 
A:
After careful consideration, the Board has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock and the Merger, are fair
to, and in the best interests of, SYNNEX and SYNNEX’ stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX
common stock in connection with the Merger and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement,
(iii) directed that the Merger Agreement, issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger and the amendments to the
SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation be submitted to SYNNEX’ stockholders for their approval, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of SYNNEX adopt the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance
of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger and the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Share Issuance Proposal, “FOR” the
Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, “FOR” the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, and “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal.
For a discussion of the material factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions, see the section entitled “The Merger—Reasons for
Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement.” In addition, with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our
directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of SYNNEX’ stockholders generally. See
the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Table of Contents
Q:
Do I need to attend the special meeting?
 
A:
No. It is not necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date,
you may vote by mail, by telephone or through the internet, as described in more detail below. If you are a “street name” holder of shares, you must
follow the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee for your shares to be voted at the special meeting, as
described in more detail below.
 
Q:
How many shares of SYNNEX common stock need to be represented at the special meeting?
 
A:
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock
representing a majority of the votes which all holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock are entitled to cast constitutes a quorum for the purpose
of considering the proposals. As of June 8, 2021, there were 51,921,692 shares of SYNNEX common stock outstanding. If you are a stockholder of
SYNNEX as of the close of business on the record date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through the internet or at the special meeting via the
virtual meeting website, you will be considered part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of SYNNEX common stock and you
provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of SYNNEX common stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee
with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.
All shares of SYNNEX common stock held by stockholders that attend the special meeting via the virtual meeting website, or are represented by
proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their
proxy that they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special
meeting may be adjourned.
 
Q:
What will happen if SYNNEX’ stockholders do not approve the Share Issuance Proposal?
 
A:
SYNNEX is proposing the Share Issuance Proposal in order to comply with NYSE Listing Rule 312.03, which requires stockholder approval of
certain transactions that result in the issuance of 20% or more of the outstanding voting power before the issuance of stock or securities. If the
Share Issuance Proposal is not approved, the Merger cannot be completed, which may have an adverse effect on SYNNEX’ business and financial
condition. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee.
 
Q:
What will happen if SYNNEX’ stockholders do not approve the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation?
 
A:
Approval of the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal is a condition to the completion of the Merger. If the Authorized Share Charter
Amendment Proposal is not approved, the Merger cannot be completed, which may have an adverse effect on SYNNEX’ business and financial
condition. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee.
Approval of the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. In the event that the
Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved, but the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal is approved, the
SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, as amended pursuant to the Authorized
Share Charter Amendment Proposal, shall constitute the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and applicable law. Additionally, in the event the Corporation Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved, substantially the same
provisions to waive the corporate opportunity doctrine with respect to certain directors and certain other parties will be included in the Investor
Rights Agreement instead.
 
13
Table of Contents
Q:
What will happen if SYNNEX’ stockholders do not approve the Merger Agreement Proposal?
Approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger, and therefore the failure to obtain such approval
will have no effect on the Merger.
 
Q:
What do I need to do now?
 
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes attached to this proxy statement, please
vote your shares of SYNNEX common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share
of SYNNEX common stock that you owned on the record date.
 
Q:
How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?
 
A:
You may vote by:
 
 
•
 submitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it by mail in the enclosed prepaid
envelope;
 
 
•
 submitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive;
 
 
•
 submitting your proxy through the internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you receive; or
 
 
•
 casting your vote at the special meeting by following the instructions that will be available on the virtual meeting website during the
meeting. If you are a registered holder, your virtual control number will be on your proxy card. If you hold your shares beneficially through a
bank or broker, you must provide a legal proxy from your bank or broker during registration and you will be assigned a virtual control
number in order to vote your shares during the special meeting. If you are unable to obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares, you will still be
able to attend the special meeting (but will not be able to vote your shares) so long as you demonstrate proof of stock ownership.
If you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on
June 29, 2021.
Submitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet will not prevent you from casting your vote at the special meeting via the
virtual meeting website. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet even if you plan to attend the special
meeting via the virtual meeting website to ensure that your shares of SYNNEX common stock are represented at the special meeting.
If you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted “FOR” the Merger
Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Share Issuance Proposal, “FOR” the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, “FOR” the Corporate
Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
If my shares are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other nominee vote those shares for me
with respect to the proposals?
 
A:
Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of SYNNEX common stock at the special meeting unless
you provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee
on how to vote your shares with respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be
able to vote by telephone or through the internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.
 
14
Table of Contents
Q:
What if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?
 
A:
Brokers who hold shares in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine”
proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion
with respect to the approval of matters determined to be “non-routine” without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. It is expected that all
proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are “non-routine” matters. Broker non-votes occur when a broker or nominee is not instructed by
the beneficial owner of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power.
If you are a stockholder of SYNNEX and you do not instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares:
 
 
•
 your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger Agreement Proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will
have the same effect as a vote against such proposal;
 
 
•
 your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Share Issuance Proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will
have no effect on the outcome of such proposal (assuming a quorum is present);
 
 
•
 your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, which broker
non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal;
 
 
•
 your bank, broker, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, which
broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal; and
 
 
•
 your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Adjournment Proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will have
no effect on the outcome of such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).
 
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or through the internet?
 
A:
Yes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy by delivering
a signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy is revoked and bearing a date later than the date of the proxy delivered to Corporate
Secretary, SYNNEX Corporation, 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont, California 94538. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by submitting
another proxy by telephone or through the internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may also submit a later-
dated proxy card relating to the same shares. If you voted by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should retain
a copy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or change your vote by
telephone or through the internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting
website and voting at the meeting. However, simply attending the special meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy.
“Street name” holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to
how to revoke or change their proxies. If you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of SYNNEX common stock,
you must follow the instructions received from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.
All properly submitted proxies received by us before the special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being exercised at the special
meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided,
“FOR” each of the proposals.
 
15
Table of Contents
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
 
A:
If you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock that are registered in more than one account. For
example, if you own your shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you
will receive, and you will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record
ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of SYNNEX common stock are voted, you will need to submit your proxies by mailing in
each proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the internet by using the different voter control number(s) on each proxy card.
 
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
 
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two or more stockholders reside,
unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases,
each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate
information and reduces printing and mailing expenses. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of SYNNEX common stock, you may
have already received a householding notification. For additional information, see the section entitled “Householding of Proxy Material.”
 
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of SYNNEX common stock before the special meeting?
 
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of completion of the Merger. If you own shares of SYNNEX common stock
as of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special
meeting.
 
Q:
Do I have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger?
 
A:
SYNNEX’ stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
 
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
 
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the second half
of the calendar year 2021, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The
Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived). For additional information, see the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger.”
 
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 
A:
If the Merger is not completed at any time prior to the effective time of the Merger by mutual written agreement of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent or for
any other reason, the Merger Agreement will be void and have no effect, and there will not be any liability or obligation on the part of any party,
except that (i) no termination will relieve any party from liability for any Willful Breach, (ii) no termination will affect the obligations of the parties
contained in the confidentiality agreement between them, and (ii) certain other provisions of the Merger Agreement, including provisions with
respect to the allocation of fees and expenses, including, if applicable, the termination fees described below, will survive such termination.
We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares
of SYNNEX common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject with respect to their
ownership of SYNNEX common stock. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee.
For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger—Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed.”

concerns;

percentage of SYNNEX prior to the Merger;

In deciding whether to vote for the Merger Agreement Proposal, Share Issuance Proposal, Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, the Corporate
Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, you are urged to carefully consider all of the information included or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which are listed in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.” You should also read
and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of SYNNEX and Tech Data because these risks will also affect the combined company. The
risks associated with the business of SYNNEX can be found in the SYNNEX Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2020 under
the heading “Risk Factors”, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in SYNNEX’ subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current
Reports on Form 8-K, such risk factors which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. Risks associated with the business of Tech Data
can be found below in the section entitled “Risks Relating to Tech Data.” In addition, you are urged to carefully consider the following material risks
relating to the Merger and the business of the combined company.",30,30

SYNNEX’ stockholders will have reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of the combined
company.
SYNNEX’ stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Board and on other matters affecting SYNNEX. Upon consummation of the
Merger, each stockholder of SYNNEX will become a stockholder of the combined company with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is
smaller than such stockholder’s percentage ownership of SYNNEX immediately prior to the Merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, based on the
estimated number of shares of common stock of SYNNEX that will be outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Merger, SYNNEX estimates
that holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock as of immediately prior to the completion of the Merger will hold, in the aggregate, approximately 55%
of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company immediately following the completion of the Merger, and Tiger
Holdings as of immediately prior to the completion of the Merger will hold, in the aggregate, approximately 45% of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of the combined company immediately following the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, SYNNEX’ stockholders will have less
influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of SYNNEX.
Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the Merger.
The Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement, including, including (i) the approval of SYNNEX’
stockholders will have been obtained, (ii) the SYNNEX common stock issuable as Merger Consideration will have been authorized for listing on the
NYSE, (iii) the HSR Act Clearance and other required regulatory approvals will have been obtained, and (iv) no law, order, injunction or decree will be in
effect that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the Merger. No assurance can be given that the required stockholder consents and approvals will be
obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the conditions are
satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the consents and approvals. Any delay in completing the Merger could
cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that SYNNEX expects to achieve if the Merger is
successfully completed within its expected time frame. For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to
completion of the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger.”
 
20Table of Contents
In order to complete the Merger, SYNNEX and Tech Data must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are not
granted, the Merger cannot be completed.
Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the Merger under the HSR Act and
other similar antitrust laws in certain other countries as well as certain other applicable laws or regulations and the governmental authorizations required
to complete the Merger having been obtained and being in full force and effect. Although SYNNEX and Tech Data have agreed in the Merger Agreement
to use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings or obtain the required governmental authorizations,
as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or authorizations will be obtained, and if such authorizations
are not obtained, the Merger will not be completed.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.
Either SYNNEX or Tiger Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the Merger is not
completed by December 22, 2021 (which date may be extended to March 22, 2022 under circumstances if certain regulatory approvals have not been
obtained by December 22, 2021 and then again to June 22, 2022 under such circumstances if such regulatory approvals have not been obtained by
March 22, 2022). In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX may be
required to pay Tiger Parent a termination fee of up to $131,683,200, including certain circumstances in which the Board effects a change of
recommendation (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Change of Recommendation”) or under certain circumstances where
SYNNEX enters into an agreement with respect to (or consummates) a superior proposal following the termination of the Merger Agreement. See the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” for a more complete discussion of the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement
could be terminated and when a termination fee may be payable by SYNNEX.
SYNNEX may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.
SYNNEX may determine to waive, in whole or part, one or more of the conditions of its obligations to consummate the Merger. SYNNEX currently expects
to evaluate the materiality of any waiver and its effect on SYNNEX’ stockholders in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether
any amendment of this proxy statement or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards is required in light of such waiver. Any determination whether to
waive any condition to the Merger or as to re-soliciting stockholder approval or amending this proxy statement as a result of a waiver will be made by
SYNNEX at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.
SYNNEX and Tech Data’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger.
Parties with which SYNNEX or Tech Data do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future
business relationships with us, Tech Data or the combined business. SYNNEX and Tech Data’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as
customers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with
parties other than SYNNEX, Tech Data or the combined business. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on the businesses, financial
condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including a material and adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated
benefits of the Merger. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination of the
Merger Agreement.

Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of SYNNEX.
If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including SYNNEX’ stockholders’ failing to approve the issuance of the SYNNEX common stock in
connection with the Merger, the ongoing business of SYNNEX may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed
the Merger, SYNNEX would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:
 
 
•
 We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and from our customers,
vendors and employees;
 
 
•
 We may be required to pay Tech Data a fee of up to approximately $132 million if the Merger is not consummated;
 
 
•
 We will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed;
 
 
•
 The Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Merger; and
 
 
•
 Matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our
management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to
us as an independent company.
There can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect
SYNNEX’ businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.
The directors and executive officers of SYNNEX have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to, those of SYNNEX’
stockholders.
When considering the recommendations of the Board with respect to the proposals described in this proxy statement, SYNNEX’ stockholders should be
aware that the directors and executive officers of SYNNEX have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of SYNNEX’
stockholders generally. These interests include the continued employment of certain executive officers of SYNNEX by the combined company, the
continued service of certain directors of SYNNEX as directors of the combined company, the treatment in the Merger of outstanding equity, equity-based
and incentive awards, severance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements, and the right to continued indemnification of former
directors and officers by the combined company.
SYNNEX’ stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider the recommendations of the Board. The Board was aware of and
considered these interests when it (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the amendments to the
SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger, and the Merger, are fair to, and in
the best interests of, SYNNEX and SYNNEX’ stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in
connection with the Merger, and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (iii) directed that the Merger
Agreement, issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Merger and the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of
Incorporation be submitted to SYNNEX’ stockholders for their approval, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of SYNNEX adopt the
Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in
connection with the Merger and the amendments to the SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement. The interests of our Board and our executive officers are described in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Table of Contents
SYNNEX and Tech Data may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the Merger.
Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on SYNNEX and Tech Data employees, including the change in Chief Executive Officer, may have an adverse
effect on each of SYNNEX and Tech Data separately and consequently the combined business. This uncertainty may impair SYNNEX’ and Tech Data’s
ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the
pendency of the Merger, as employees of SYNNEX and Tech Data may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business.
Furthermore, if key employees of SYNNEX or Tech Data depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and
difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined business, we may have to incur significant costs in
retaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of
the Merger may be adversely affected.
Stockholder lawsuits relating to the Merger have been filed against us, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger
from being completed.
Stockholder lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. As of June 8, 2021, three such suits have been
brought against SYNNEX and the Board. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert
management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and
financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then that injunction may
delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.
The proposed acquisition of Tech Data and the incurrence of debt to fund the proposed acquisition of Tech Data may impact our financial position
and subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.
As of February 28, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of total debt, and as of May 31, 2021 this amount has not materially changed. We expect to incur a substantial
amount of additional debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Tech Data. We expect that upon completion of the proposed acquisition of
Tech Data and the related financing transactions, our total debt will increase to approximately $4 billion. In addition, we expect to have capacity to incur
significant additional debt in excess of $4 billion to fund our working capital needs and for other corporate purposes. If we are unable to
raise financing on acceptable terms, we may need to rely on the Bridge Facility, which would result in higher borrowing costs and will have a shorter
maturity than those from anticipated, long-term debt financing alternatives. In addition, if we are unable to obtain long-term debt financing on the terms
we anticipate, then such alternative long-term debt financing may subject us to higher costs of borrowing, and additional financial and operating
covenants, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. We expect to obtain long term unsecured debt financing in lieu of all or a
portion of the commitments provided under Tranche C of the Bridge Facility. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain such
permanent debt financing or that it will be on acceptable terms. In addition, we anticipate that as a result of the debt we expect to incur to finance the
proposed acquisition, our credit and the long term debt financing will be rated by credit rating agencies. Any potential future negative change in our
credit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise long term permanent financing on terms that are acceptable to us or to raise additional capital on
terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our overall cost of capital; and have other negative
implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.
The expected replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate and other interbank offered rates with risk-free rates may have an impact on our
business.
On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (which we refer to as the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer
persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. As a result, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot
be guaranteed after 2021 and
 
23
Table of Contents
it is likely that LIBOR will be phased out or modified by 2023. The FCA and the submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR
indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. Financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating
the phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates
Committee (which we refer to as the “ARRC”) was tasked with identifying alternative reference rates to replace LIBOR. The Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (which we refer to as “SOFR”) has emerged as the ARRC’s preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing
cash overnight collateralized by the Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market. Accordingly, the composition and characteristics of SOFR
are not the same as those of U.S. dollar LIBOR and SOFR is not the economic equivalent of U.S. dollar LIBOR. While SOFR is a secured rate, U.S. dollar
LIBOR is an unsecured rate. In addition, while SOFR is a backward-looking rate based on an overnight rate, U.S. dollar LIBOR is a forward-looking rate
that represents interbank funding for a specified term. In the future, including as a result of the Merger, we may have other debt that is linked to interbank
offered rates in other currencies that will be phased out and replaced by other alternative reference rates based on local currencies. At this time, it is not
possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates. In addition, it is uncertain what methods of calculating a
replacement rate will be adopted generally or whether different industry bodies, such as the loan market and the derivative market, will adopt the same
methodologies.
As of February 28, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of debt outstanding on facilities with interest rates based on LIBOR, and as of May 31, 2021, this has not
materially changed. Some of our credit facilities include fallback language that seeks to facilitate an agreement with our lenders on a replacement rate for
LIBOR in the event of its discontinuance or that automatically replaces LIBOR with benchmark rates based on SOFR upon certain triggering events. We
cannot predict what the impact of any such replacement rate would be to our interest expense. Potential changes to the underlying floating-rate indices
and reference rates may have an adverse impact on our liabilities indexed to LIBOR and could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows.
Furthermore, we cannot predict or quantify the time, effort and cost required to transition to the use of new benchmark rates, including with respect to
negotiating and implementing any necessary changes to existing contractual agreements, and implementing changes to our systems and processes. We
continue to evaluate the operational and other effects of such changes.
We will incur significant transaction and integration-related costs in connection with the Merger.
We expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger and combining the operations of Tech Data with our operations. We will
incur significant transaction costs related to the Merger. We also will incur significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and
implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude
of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Merger and the integration of Tech Data into our business. Although we expect
that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to
offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.
If our due diligence investigation of Tech Data was inadequate or if unexpected risks related to Tech Data’s business materialize, it could have a
material adverse effect on our stockholders’ investment.
Even though we conducted a due diligence investigation of Tech Data, we cannot be sure that our diligence surfaced all material issues that may be
present inside Tech Data or its business, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that
factors outside of Tech Data and its business and outside of its control will not arise later. If any such material issues arise, they may materially and
adversely impact the ongoing business of the combined company and our stockholders’ investment.
The lack of a public market for Tiger Parent’s shares makes it difficult to evaluate the value of such shares.
The outstanding capital stock of Tiger Parent is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it difficult to
determine the fair market value of Tiger Parent. Because the percentage of
 
24
Table of Contents
SYNNEX’ equity to be issued to Tiger Holdings as the Merger Consideration will be determined based on an exchange ratio set forth in the Merger
Agreement as a result of negotiations between the parties that will not be adjusted even if there is a change in the value of SYNNEX, it is possible that
the value of SYNNEX common stock to be received by Tiger Holdings will be more than the fair market value of Tiger Parent.
The opinions rendered to SYNNEX from Duff & Phelps will not reflect changes in circumstances between the dates of such opinions and the
completion of the Merger.
On March 16, 2021, Duff & Phelps delivered its Opinion to the Board that, as of the date of the Opinion and subject to and based on the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered, limitations of the review undertaken and qualifications contained in such Opinion, the consideration to
be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to SYNNEX and its stockholders (without giving effect to any impact of the
Merger on any particular stockholder other than in its capacity as a stockholder).
SYNNEX has not obtained, nor will it obtain, an updated opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration as of
the date of this proxy statement or prior to the completion of the Merger from Duff & Phelps. Duff & Phelps’ opinion was necessarily based on economic,
monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Duff & Phelps only as of the date of the opinion and does
not address the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, at the time the Merger is completed. Changes in the operations and
prospects of SYNNEX and Tech Data, general economic, monetary, market and other conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of
SYNNEX and Tech Data, and on which the opinion of Duff & Phelps was based, may alter the value of SYNNEX or Tech Data or the prices of shares of
SYNNEX common stock or Tiger Parent’s common stock by the time the Merger is completed. The opinion of Duff & Phelps does not speak as of any
date other than the date of such opinion. For a more complete description of the above-described opinion, please refer to “The Merger—Opinion of Duff 
& Phelps, LLC.”",30,35

After completion of the Merger, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which could adversely affect the value of our common
stock.
The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of SYNNEX and Tech
Data. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including:
 
 
•
 our ability to successfully combine the businesses of SYNNEX and Tech Data;
 
 
•
 whether the combined businesses will perform as expected;
 
 
•
 the reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the acquisition; and
 
 
•
 the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Tech Data.
If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of SYNNEX and Tech Data within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost
savings and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not
perform as expected, and the value of our common shares may be adversely affected.
SYNNEX and Tech Data have operated and, until completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that
our businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key SYNNEX or Tech Data employees,
the disruption of either or both company’s ongoing businesses, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-
 
25Table of Contents
completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed to realize the anticipated benefits
of the Merger so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:
 
 
•
 integrating the companies’ technologies, products and services;
 
 
•
 identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;
 
 
•
 harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies,
procedures and processes;
 
 
•
 addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;
 
 
•
 consolidating the companies’ corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;
 
 
•
 managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations;
 
 
•
 maintaining existing agreements with customers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective
customers and vendors; and
 
 
•
 consolidating offices of SYNNEX and Tech Data that are currently in or near the same location.
In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of either or both companies’ management and resources may be focused on completion of the
Merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each
company’s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.
The market price for shares of common stock of the combined company following the completion of the Merger may be affected by factors different
from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of SYNNEX common stock.
Upon consummation of the Merger, SYNNEX’ stockholders and Tiger Holdings will both hold shares of common stock in the combined company.
SYNNEX’ and Tech Data’s businesses differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that
are different from those currently or historically affecting the results of operations of SYNNEX and those currently or historically affecting the results of
operations of Tech Data. The results of operations of the combined company may also be affected by factors different from those that currently affect or
have historically affected either SYNNEX or Tech Data. For a discussion of the businesses of each of SYNNEX and Tech Data and some important
factors to consider in connection with those businesses, please see the section entitled “Parties to the Merger” and the documents and information
included elsewhere in this proxy statement or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement and listed under the section entitled “Where You Can
Find More Information.”
The SYNNEX and Tech Data unaudited prospective financial information is inherently subject to uncertainties, the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information included in this document is preliminary and the combined company’s actual financial position and results of
operations after the Merger may differ materially from these estimates and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
included in this proxy statement.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement is presented for illustrative purposes only, contains
a variety of adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s actual financial
position or results of operations would have been had the Merger been completed on the dates indicated. The combined company’s actual results and
financial position after the Merger may differ materially and adversely from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included
in this proxy statement. For more information, see the sections entitled “SYNNEX Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.”

While presented with numeric specificity, the SYNNEX and Tech Data unaudited prospective financial information provided in this proxy statement is
based on numerous variables and assumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and competition and general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to SYNNEX’ or Tech Data’s business, as applicable) that are
inherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of the respective management teams of SYNNEX and Tech Data. As a result, actual
results may differ materially from the unaudited prospective financial information. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause these
unaudited projected financial forecasts to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to SYNNEX’ or Tech Data’s
business, as applicable (including each company’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), general business
and economic conditions. For more information see the sections entitled “The Merger—Certain SYNNEX Projections.”
Apollo will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of the Board, matters subject to stockholder approval and/or SYNNEX’
operations.
Upon the completion of the Merger, the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock issuable as a portion of the Merger Consideration will be 44 million
shares, which will result in Tiger Holdings, an affiliate of Apollo and sole holder of shares of Tiger Parent’s common stock, holding approximately 45% of
the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock of SYNNEX as of June 8, 2021.
In addition, SYNNEX and Tiger Holdings will enter into the Investor Rights Agreement at the closing, which provides that following the closing, the
Board shall be comprised of eleven directors, and Tiger Holdings shall have the right to nominate a certain number of directors, depending on the
percentage of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock held by Tiger Holdings or certain of its affiliates, as further described in the section
entitled “Investor Rights Agreement.”
As a result of the SYNNEX common stock that will be held by affiliates of Apollo and the Investor Rights Agreement described above, Apollo will be in a
position to influence (subject to organizational documents and Delaware law) the composition of the Board and the outcome of corporate actions
requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions. This
concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction
that may otherwise be beneficial to SYNNEX and its stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of SYNNEX common stock.
Risks Relating to Tech Data",35,37
SYNNEX CORP_20210609_DEFM14A_19338736_4236234.Pdf,Risks Relating to Tech Data,"Risks Relating to Tech Data
Because SYNNEX and Tech Data operate similar businesses in similar industries, many of the risks relating to SYNNEX and its business disclosed in
SYNNEX’ filings with the SEC are applicable to Tech Data and its business as well. This section should be read in conjunction with the risks relating
to SYNNEX and its business disclosed in SYNNEX’ filings with the SEC.
Tech Data’s ability to earn profit is more challenging when sales slow from a down economy as a result of gross profit declining faster than cost
reduction efforts taking effect.
Adverse economic conditions may result in lower demand for the products and services Tech Data sells. When Tech Data experiences a rapid decline in
demand for products, Tech Data experiences more difficulty in achieving the gross profit and operating profit it desires due to the lower sales and
increased pricing pressure. The economic environment may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions, such as rebates, cash discounts and
cooperative marketing efforts, which may also result in downward pressure on Tech Data’s gross profit. As a result, there is pressure to reduce the cost
of operations in order to maximize operating profits. To the extent Tech Data cannot reduce costs to offset such decline in gross profits, Tech Data’s
operating profits
 
27Table of Contents
typically deteriorate. The benefits from cost reductions may also take longer to fully realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand
or changes in vendor terms and conditions. Should Tech Data experience a decline in operating profits or not achieve the planned level of growth in
operations of previously acquired companies, the valuations Tech Data develops for purposes of its goodwill impairment test may be adversely affected,
potentially resulting in impairment charges. Deterioration in the financial and credit markets heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delays in
payment. Future deterioration in the credit markets could result in reduced availability of credit insurance to cover customer accounts. This, in turn, may
result in Tech Data reducing the credit lines Tech Data provides to customers, thereby having a negative impact on Tech Data’s net sales, gross profits
and net income.
Tech Data’s competitors can take more market share by reducing prices on vendor products that contribute the most to Tech Data’s profitability.
The technology distribution industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on product availability, credit terms and availability, price,
effectiveness of information systems and e-commerce tools, speed of delivery, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of
product lines and training, service and support. Tech Data’s customers are not required to purchase any specific volume of products from Tech Data and
may move business if pricing is reduced by competitors, resulting in lower sales. As a result, Tech Data must be extremely flexible in determining when to
reduce prices to maintain market share and sales volumes and when to allow the sales volumes to decline to maintain the quality of Tech Data’s
profitability. Tech Data competes with a variety of regional, national and international wholesale distributors, some of which may have greater financial
resources than Tech Data.
Tech Data is dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems, including system security
breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks, may negatively impact Tech Data’s business and results of operations.
Cyber-attacks and other tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations
are constantly evolving and have been increasing in sophistication in recent years. High profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of
sensitive information have occurred with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack
threat and improved data protection methods. In addition, regulations related to data protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection
Regulation (which we refer to as “GDPR”) which took effect in May 2018, create a range of new compliance obligations for Tech Data. While to date Tech
Data has not experienced a significant data loss, significant compromise or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, Tech Data’s
systems, those of Tech Data’s customers, and those of Tech Data’s third-party service providers are under constant threat. Cybercrime, including
phishing, social engineering, attempts to overload Tech Data’s servers with denial-of-service attacks, or similar disruptions from unauthorized access to
Tech Data’s systems, could cause critical data loss or the disclosure or use of personal or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to
fraudulently induce employees to disclose personally identifiable information or other confidential information which could expose Tech Data to a risk of
loss or misuse of this information.
Tech Data is dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and Tech Data is vulnerable to failure of these systems, including
through system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks. If these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or
unavailability of data and disruption to Tech Data’s business may have a material adverse effect on Tech Data’s reputation and harm Tech Data’s
relationships with vendors and customers. Additionally, these events may lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability from fines,
including in relation to noncompliance with the GDPR, as well as possible litigation and punitive damages. Failures of Tech Data’s internal information or
telecommunications systems may prevent Tech Data from taking customer orders, shipping products and billing customers. Sales may also be impacted if
Tech Data customers are unable to access Tech Data’s pricing and product availability

information. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on Tech Data’s business and results of operations.
Tech Data may not be able to ship products if Tech Data’s third party shipping companies cease operations temporarily or permanently.
Tech Data relies on arrangements with independent shipping companies for the delivery of its products from vendors and to customers. The failure or
inability of these shipping companies to deliver products or the unavailability of their shipping services, even temporarily, may have an adverse effect on
Tech Data’s business and operating results.
If Tech Data’s vendors do not continue to provide price protection for inventory Tech Data purchases from them, Tech Data’s profit from the sale of
that inventory may decline.
It is very typical in this industry that the value of inventory will decline as a result of price reductions by vendors or technological obsolescence. It is the
policy of many of Tech Data’s vendors to protect distributors from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or the vendors’ price
reductions. Some vendors, however, may be unwilling or unable to pay Tech Data for price protection claims or products returned to them under purchase
agreements. Moreover, industry practices are sometimes not embodied in written agreements and do not protect Tech Data in all cases from declines in
inventory value. No assurance can be given that such practices to protect distributors will continue, that unforeseen new product developments will not
adversely affect Tech Data or that Tech Data will be able to successfully manage its existing and future inventories.
Failure to obtain adequate product supplies from Tech Data’s largest vendors, or terminations of a supply or services agreement, or a significant
change in vendor terms or conditions of sale by Tech Data’s largest vendors may negatively affect Tech Data’s financial condition or results of
operations.
A significant percentage of Tech Data’s revenues are from products it purchases from certain vendors, such as Apple, Inc., HP Inc. and Cisco Systems,
Inc. These vendors have significant negotiating power over Tech Data and rapid, significant or adverse changes in sales terms and conditions, such as
reducing the amount of price protection and return rights as well as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to Tech
Data, may reduce the profit Tech Data can earn on these vendors’ products and result in loss of revenue and profitability. Tech Data’s gross profit could
be negatively impacted if it is unable to pass through the impact of these changes to Tech Data’s customers or cannot develop systems to manage
ongoing vendor programs. Additionally, significant changes in vendor payment terms or payment arrangements could negatively impact Tech Data’s
liquidity and financial condition. Tech Data’s standard vendor distribution agreement permits termination without cause by either party upon 30 days’
notice. The loss of a relationship with any of Tech Data’s key vendors, a change in their strategy (such as increasing direct sales), the merger or
reorganization of significant vendors or significant changes in terms on their products may adversely affect Tech Data’s business.
Tech Data conducts business in countries outside of the U.S., which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that result in losses
in certain periods.
Approximately 62%, 58%, 60% and 61% of Tech Data’s net sales during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020
to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, respectively, were generated in countries outside of the U.S., which
exposes Tech Data to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Tech Data may enter into short-term forward exchange or option contracts to hedge
this risk. Nevertheless, volatile foreign currency exchange rates increase Tech Data’s risk of loss related to products purchased in a currency other than
the currency in which those products are sold. While Tech Data maintains policies to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates, extreme
fluctuations have resulted in Tech Data incurring losses in some countries. Furthermore, Tech Data’s local competitors in certain markets may have
different purchasing models that provide them reduced foreign currency exposure
 
29
Table of Contents
compared to Tech Data. This may result in market pricing that Tech Data cannot meet without significantly lower profit on sales. In addition, Tech Data
may be exposed to foreign exchange risk that may occur as a result of the United Kingdom’s (which we refer to as “U.K.”) withdrawal from the European
Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Brexit may adversely affect global economic and market conditions and could contribute to volatility in the
foreign exchange markets, which Tech Data may be unable to effectively manage through its foreign exchange risk management program.
The translation of the financial statements of foreign operations into U.S. dollars is also impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
which may positively or negatively impact Tech Data’s results of operations. In addition, the value of Tech Data’s equity investment in foreign countries
may fluctuate based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These fluctuations, which are recorded in a cumulative translation adjustment
account, may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when Tech Data made
investments in the country. The realization of any or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on Tech Data’s financial results.
Natural disasters, public health crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of Tech Data’s control may negatively impact Tech
Data’s business and results of operations.
If any of Tech Data’s facilities or the facilities of its suppliers, service providers, or customers, is affected by public health crises, such as pandemics and
epidemics; political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict; or other events outside of its control, Tech Data’s business,
operating results and reputation could suffer. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact the availability of products from Tech Data’s
suppliers, consumer and business spending in the impacted regions or globally, which could adversely impact its operating results.
For example, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global impact of the COVID-19
pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility, and impeded global supply
chains, including Tech Data’s. Tech Data’s suppliers are experiencing delays in the production and export of their products, and Tech Data has
experienced impacts to its freight and logistic operations, including increased costs. Additionally, Tech Data may need to close logistics centers for a
period of time as a result of government mandates or self-imposed health and safety initiatives. While Tech Data has initiated short-term measures to
address delays in its supply chain, including advance purchases, such measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, and such steps may negatively impact Tech Data’s financial condition.
The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial and credit markets, including impacts on the ability of Tech Data’s customers to obtain
access to sources of liquidity, heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delays in payment which could result in increased credit losses. Future
deterioration in the credit markets could result in reduced availability of credit insurance to cover customer accounts. This, in turn, may result in reducing
Tech Data’s credit lines they provide to customers, thereby having a negative impact on net sales, gross profits and net income. Tech Data’s business
requires substantial capital to operate. Tech Data has historically relied upon cash generated from operations, bank credit lines, trade credit from vendors
and accounts receivable purchase agreements to satisfy capital needs and to finance growth. Significant changes in vendor payment terms or payment
arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact liquidity and financial condition. Tech Data has various committed and
uncommitted lines of credit, short-term loans and overdraft facilities which are provided on an unsecured, short-term basis and are reviewed periodically
for renewal, which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, financial institutions’ willingness to purchase receivables under accounts
receivable purchase agreements may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tech Data cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on its operations, including its ability to execute its business
strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, due to
 
30
Table of Contents
uncertainties including the severity and duration of the pandemic, the effect on its customers and customer demand and the length of the restrictions and
closures imposed by various governments; however, it may experience a negative impact to its revenue and earnings from the COVID-19 pandemic in the
fiscal 2022 or beyond.
In addition, certain of Tech Data’s facilities, including its corporate headquarters in Clearwater, Florida, are located in geographic areas that heighten its
exposure to hurricanes, tropical storms and other severe weather events. Future weather events could cause severe damage to Tech Data’s property and
technology and could cause major disruptions to its operations. Tech Data carries property damage and business interruption insurance; however, there
can be no assurance that such insurance would be adequate to cover any losses Tech Data may incur. As such, a hurricane, tropical storm or severe
weather event may have an adverse effect on Tech Data’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
Tech Data has international operations which exposes it to risks associated with conducting business in multiple jurisdictions.
Tech Data’s international operations are subject to other risks such as the imposition of governmental controls, export license requirements, restrictions
on the export of certain technology, political instability, trade restrictions, tariff changes, uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit,
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws (in particular related to items such as
duty and taxation), difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, longer collection periods, the impact of local economic conditions and practices,
uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations, and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of
other jurisdictions.
The U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. and the Chinese government has imposed tariffs on certain products
imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that Tech Data purchases from its suppliers. The new tariffs, along with
any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While Tech
Data intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. There can be no
assurance that these and other factors will not have an adverse effect on Tech Data’s business.
Tech Data is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the impact of trade discussions between the U.S. and China and related U.S. security risks
and export controls. On May 15, 2019, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order that authorized export controls on Chinese entities
determined to be a U.S. security threat. At the same time, the U.S. Commerce Dept. placed certain Chinese companies and their subsidiaries on the U.S.
Entity List requiring U.S. companies to obtain export licensing approval before providing certain technology. Tech Data holds inventory of products
impacted by the recent government action and there is uncertainty relating to the disposition of this inventory due to restrictions that would prevent
purchasers from updating software on the products in the future. While Tech Data continues to take steps to mitigate its exposure to this situation, if the
sale of these products is delayed or Tech Data is unable to return or dispose of its inventory on favorable economic terms, Tech Data may incur
additional carrying costs for the inventory or otherwise record losses associated with the inventory.
Changes in tax laws or tax rulings in the jurisdictions in which Tech Data operates may materially impact its financial position and results of operations.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Project, and has issued and will
continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which Tech Data’s tax obligations are
determined in many of the countries in which it does business. Certain countries are evaluating their tax policies and regulations, which could affect
international business and may have an adverse effect on Tech Data’s overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax
compliance. For
 
31
Table of Contents
example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (which we refer to as “U.S. Tax Reform”) which
significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and
implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Additional
changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are
interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect Tech Data’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, while Tech Data’s labor force in the U.S. is currently non-union, employees of certain other subsidiaries are subject to collective bargaining or
similar arrangements. Tech Data does business in certain foreign countries where labor disruption is more common than is experienced in the U.S. and
some of the freight carriers Tech Data uses are unionized. A labor strike by a group of Tech Data’s employees, one of its freight carriers, one of its
vendors, a general strike by civil service employees or a governmental shutdown could have an adverse effect on Tech Data’s business. Many of the
products Tech Data sells are manufactured in countries other than the countries in which its logistics centers are located. The inability to receive
products into the logistics centers because of government action or labor disputes at critical ports of entry may have an adverse effect on Tech Data’s
business.
Tech Data has incurred substantial indebtedness that may impact its financial position and subject it to financial and operating restrictions,
decrease its access to capital, and / or increase its borrowing costs, which may adversely affect its operations and financial results.
Tech Data’s business requires substantial capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade
creditors. Tech Data has historically relied upon cash generated from operations, bank credit lines, trade credit from vendors, accounts receivable
purchase agreements, proceeds from public offerings of Tech Data’s common stock and proceeds from debt offerings to satisfy Tech Data’s capital needs
and to finance growth. The incurrence of debt under Tech Data’s senior notes and other credit facilities subject it to financial and operating covenants,
which may limit its ability to borrow and its flexibility in responding to its business needs.
As of January 31, 2021, Tech Data had approximately $2.3 billion of total debt. If Tech Data is not able to maintain compliance with stated financial
covenants or if Tech Data breaches other covenants in any debt agreement, it could be in default under such agreement. Such a default may allow Tech
Data’s creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross-default provision
applies. Tech Data’s overall leverage and terms of its financing could, among other things:
 
 
•
 limit Tech Data’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or for general
corporate purposes;
 
 
•
 make it more difficult to satisfy Tech Data’s obligations under the terms of the debt;
 
 
•
 limit its ability to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to Tech Data or at all;
 
 
•
 make it more difficult to obtain trade credit from vendors;
 
 
•
 limit Tech Data’s flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and repurchase shares of its common stock;
and
 
 
•
 increase Tech Data’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.
Changes in Tech Data’s credit rating or other market factors may increase its interest expense or other costs of capital.
Certain of Tech Data’s financing instruments involve variable rate debt, thus exposing it to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, the
interest rate payable on the 2022 senior notes and the 2027 senior
 
32
Table of Contents
notes and certain other credit facilities would be subject to adjustment from time to time if Tech Data’s credit rating is downgraded. The U.K.’s Financial
Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun
publishing SOFR, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At
this time, Tech Data cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the
discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if Tech Data’s lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, Tech Data may
experience potential increases in interest rates on its variable rate debt, which could adversely impact its interest expense, results of operations and cash
flows.
Tech Data cannot predict what losses it might incur in litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that it may be involved
with from time to time.
Tech Data cannot predict what losses it might incur from litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that it may be involved with
from time to time. There are various other claims, lawsuits and pending actions against Tech Data. From time to time, Tech Data is involved in various
legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to its business, which may include claims with respect to
antitrust, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. In the ordinary course of business, Tech Data also receives inquiries from and has discussions with
government entities regarding the compliance of its contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations. These matters can be time-consuming,
divert management’s attention and resources and cause Tech Data to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal
proceedings may also harm Tech Data’s reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome
of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, Tech Data’s business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an
unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations. Tech Data does not expect that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. However, the resolution of certain of these matters could be
material to its operating results for any particular period. Tech Data can make no assurances that it will ultimately be successful in its defense of any of
these matters.

For the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Board is requesting the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX
common stock. Therefore, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
The Share Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of SYNNEX common stock present at the special meeting, whether
via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal.
The Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX
common stock. Therefore, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
The Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX
common stock. Therefore, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
The Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of SYNNEX common stock present at the special meeting, whether via
the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, abstentions from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the
shares of SYNNEX common stock present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on
such matter may adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time.
A broker non-vote with respect to SYNNEX common stock occurs when (i) shares of SYNNEX common stock held by a broker or other nominee are
represented, in person or by proxy, at a meeting of SYNNEX’ stockholders, (ii) the bank, broker or other nominee has not received voting instructions
from the beneficial owner on a particular proposal and (iii) the bank, broker or other nominee does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the
shares of SYNNEX common stock on a particular proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals. A bank, broker, trust or other nominee
may exercise discretion in voting on routine matters but may not exercise discretion and therefore will not vote on non-routine matters if instructions are
not given.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. As a result, there will not be any broker non-
votes at the special meeting.

Accordingly, if your shares of SYNNEX common stock are held in “street name,” a bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your
shares, and your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee on how to vote. Because the approval of each of (1) the Merger Agreement Proposal, (2) the Authorized Share Charter Amendment
Proposal and (3) the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
SYNNEX common stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, and the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment
Proposal. Because the approval of each of (a) the Share Issuance Proposal and (b) the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of shares
representing a majority of the shares present at the special meeting, whether via the virtual meeting website or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on
such matter, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on such proposal, the failure to provide
your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of those proposals.
How to Vote
Stockholders have a choice of voting by proxy by completing a proxy card and mailing it in the prepaid envelope provided, by calling a toll-free telephone
number or through the internet. Please refer to your proxy card or the information forwarded by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to see which
options are available to you. The telephone and internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on June 29, 2021.
If you submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet voting procedures, but do not include “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on a
proposal to be voted, your shares will be voted in favor of that proposal. If you indicate “ABSTAIN” on a proposal to be voted, it will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” that proposal. If you wish to vote by proxy and your shares are held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you must
follow the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. Unless you give your bank, broker, trust or other nominee
instructions on how to vote your shares of SYNNEX common stock, your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will not be able to vote your shares on the
proposals.
If you wish to vote by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting website and your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder
of record, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank, broker or other holder of record authorizing you to vote at the special
meeting. Obtaining a legal proxy may take several days.
If you do not submit a proxy or otherwise vote your shares of SYNNEX common stock in any of the ways described above, it will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate Opportunity Charter
Amendment Proposal, but will have no effect on the approval of the Share Issuance Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. The following chronology does not
purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board, or the representatives of each company, their respective advisors or any other persons.
The Board, acting independently and with the advice of its management team, and in the ordinary course of business, reviews and assesses the
operations, financial performance and industry conditions of SYNNEX in light of the current business and economic environment and in consideration of
its long-term business strategy to enhance value for its stockholders. From time to time, the Board and SYNNEX’ management teams have evaluated and
considered a variety of potential financial and strategic options in light of industry developments and changing economic and market conditions. The
evaluations have included monitoring the financial performance and strategic transactions of others in SYNNEX’ industry, including Tech Data. Also,
from time to time, members of SYNNEX’ management have met with others in the industry to discuss trends and developments in the IT distribution
market.
On October 22, 2020, Rich Hume, the Chief Executive Officer of Tech Data, sent an email to Dennis Polk, the Chief Executive Officer of SYNNEX,
requesting a meeting to discuss various matters relating to Tech Data and SYNNEX. The parties agreed to a telephonic meeting on November 4, 2020.
On November 4, 2020, Mr. Polk and Mr. Hume had a telephonic meeting and discussed general industry trends and the SYNNEX and Tech Data

Tech Data. Mr. Polk responded that SYNNEX was open to exploring whether any strategic opportunities between the two companies would be beneficial
to SYNNEX and its stockholders. At the end of the call, Mr. Hume said that he would meet with representatives of Apollo, the sole stockholder of Tech
Data, to gauge their interest in such a transaction and would arrange a follow-up call between SYNNEX, Tech Data and Apollo.

to continue exploring a potential transaction, conduct due diligence, and discuss terms.
On December 22, 2020, Mr. Polk, Mr. Hume and representatives of Apollo had a conference call and discussed a potential strategic transaction, including
various deal structure alternatives such as an acquisition by SYNNEX of assets, an acquisition by SYNNEX of stock, a merger or a joint venture. The
parties also discussed potential terms of a possible transaction, as well as corporate governance matters and other high-level implications of a potential
transaction. The parties agreed to continue their discussions. Following the call, Mr. Polk provided the Board with a summary of the discussion.
On January 4, 2021, Mr. Hume sent Mr. Polk a non-binding indication of interest regarding a potential strategic transaction between SYNNEX and Tech
Data whereby SYNNEX and Tech Data would combine in a merger with consideration to be issued by SYNNEX consisting of 51 million shares of

Data’s current and projected financial information including balance sheets, capital structure, income and cash flow statements, adjusted EBITDA, as
currently measured by Tech Data, as well as other financial information that had been previously provided by Tech Data starting on January 21, 2021.
Management also discussed the valuation of Tech Data based on information SYNNEX had been provided to date during due diligence and reviewed
potential synergies if the companies were combined. The Board discussed other benefits of a potential transaction, including that a combined company
may be able to obtain investment grade debt, thereby lowering the overall cost of debt to the combined company. The Board discussed retaining outside
advisors and obtaining a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed transaction. The Board discussed the potential impact of a proposed
transaction on corporate culture, employees, management composition and other integration matters, including potential management changes and board
composition and discussed the anticipated timing of a potential deal, including due diligence, negotiating the transaction documents, the closing process
and timeline, regulatory approvals and other potential closing conditions. The Board also discussed whether a proposed transaction would have an
impact on the tax-free nature of the recently completed spin-off by SYNNEX of Concentrix Corporation. Following this discussion, the Board instructed
management to offer 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock as consideration and agree to Tech Data and Apollo’s proposal related to the preferred
unit payout and debt assumption.
On January 16, 2021, Mr. Polk communicated to representatives of Tech Data and Apollo an offer of 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock, along

Mr. Hume, along with representatives of Apollo, to exchange respective business, management and financial information as context for the due diligence
process.
On January 21, 2021, both SYNNEX and Tech Data began assembling diligence information to make available to a limited number of individuals
representing the other party. Additionally, both SYNNEX’ management and Tech Data’s management started the process of identifying which diligence
items should be made available on a limited access basis to a limited number of people through a separate data room. Population of the separate general
data rooms of both SYNNEX and Tech Data continued through the entire Merger negotiation process until shortly before the execution of the Merger
Agreement. Also on January 21, 2021, representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (which we refer to as “Wachtell Lipton”), Tech Data’s and
Apollo’s legal counsel, provided a draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of SYNNEX’ external legal advisor, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman

•
 the SYNNEX and Tech Data teams’ commitment to realizing the value of the Merger, and SYNNEX’ long track record of post-merger
integration and de-leveraging.

connection with its evaluation of the Merger, all of which it viewed as supporting its decision to approve the Merger and make its recommendations to

Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC. The Board considered the Opinion of Duff & Phelps to the effect that, as of the date of the Opinion and subject to and
based on the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, limitations of the review undertaken and qualifications contained in such
Opinion, the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to SYNNEX and its stockholders, as more fully
described in the section entitled “—Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC” and Annex F to this proxy statement.
Negotiations with Tech Data on the Merger Agreement. The Board considered that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (which are
described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement”), taken as a whole, including the parties’ representations,
warranties and covenants, and the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in its belief, are reasonable. The Board also
reviewed and considered the conditions to the completion of the Merger, and concluded that while the completion of the Merger is subject to various
regulatory approvals, such approvals were likely to be satisfied on a timely basis.
Timing of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
the structure of the transaction as a Merger and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The
Board also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period during which SYNNEX’ business would
be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including:
 
 
•
 the significant dilution associated with the stock issuance; the risk that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all,
as a result of a failure to satisfy certain conditions, including the approval by SYNNEX’ stockholders and the condition requiring the
expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof, including any agreement between a party and a governmental
authority not to consummate the transaction before a certain date) under the HSR Act and the making or receipt, respectively, of certain
required regulatory filings and consents;
 
 
•
 the potential length of the regulatory approval process and the period of time during which SYNNEX may be subject to the Merger
Agreement;
 
 
•
 the possibility that governmental authorities might seek to require certain actions of SYNNEX or Tech Data or impose certain terms,
conditions or limitations on SYNNEX’ or Tech Data’s businesses in connection with granting approval of the Merger or might otherwise

The Board considered all of these factors as a whole and, on balance, concluded that it supported a favorable determination to enter into the Merger
Agreement.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these
matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching
its determination. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination.
The Board based its determination on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. The factors, potential risks and
uncertainties contained in this explanation of SYNNEX’ consideration of the factors supporting the Merger and other information presented in this
section contain information that is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Tech Data Historical Quarterly Information
In connection with the Merger, Tiger Parent provided certain historical quarterly information (which we refer to as the “Quarterly Information”) to
SYNNEX. The Quarterly Information was provided to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and to help the Board and
SYNNEX’ management better understand the trends in Tech Data’s business.

SYNNEX Financial Projections
SYNNEX’ management does not as a matter of course publish detailed or long-term public forecasts or projections as to its future financial performance
beyond the then current quarter due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates and uncertainty inherent in SYNNEX’ business.
However, in connection with the evaluation of the Merger, SYNNEX’ management prepared certain unaudited long-term illustrative financial projections
of SYNNEX for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 (which we collectively refer to as the “SYNNEX Financial Projections”). Such financial projections reflected
SYNNEX’ management’s best estimates as to SYNNEX’ future performance and were on a stand-alone basis assuming SYNNEX would continue as an
independent company without giving effect to the Merger. The SYNNEX Financial Projections were provided to the Board in connection with its
evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided to Duff & Phelps for the purpose of their financial analyses and opinion, and SYNNEX
directed Duff & Phelps to use and rely on the SYNNEX Financial Projections for such purpose, and such SYNNEX Financial Projections as were so
provided to Duff & Phelps are referred to in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC.”
 
59Table of Contents
The SYNNEX Financial Projections were developed from historical financial statements and reflect numerous assumptions and estimates that SYNNEX’
management made in good faith at the time such financial projections were prepared, including, without limitation, as to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, and other factors described below in “—General.” These
assumptions and estimates are predictions about the future, concern matters that may be beyond the control of SYNNEX, were made as of the date the
SYNNEX Financial Projections were prepared, and may not be reflective of actual results, since the date such projections were prepared, now or in the
future, in light of changed circumstances, economic conditions, or other developments.

rounding.
The SYNNEX Financial Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because such
information was provided to the Board and provided to Duff & Phelps for the purpose of its financial analyses and opinion.
Tech Data Financial Projections
In connection with the Merger, Tiger Parent provided certain unaudited Tech Data financial projections (which we refer to as the “Tech Data Projections”)
to SYNNEX and to Duff & Phelps. To the knowledge of SYNNEX, the Tech Data Projections were prepared on a stand-alone basis assuming Tech Data
would continue as an independent company without giving effect to the Merger. The Tech Data Projections were provided to the Board in connection
with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided to Duff & Phelps for purposes of their financial analyses and opinion. SYNNEX

SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections
In connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the preparation of the SYNNEX synergies described below, SYNNEX made certain adjustments to the
assumptions and estimates underlying the Tech Data Projections for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 (which we collectively refer to as the “SYNNEX
Adjusted Tech Data Projections”). Such adjustments were made by SYNNEX’ management in light of, among other things, the due diligence SYNNEX
conducted on Tech Data, certain macroeconomic, industry and competitive trends, as well as to reflect a more conservative view of Tech Data’s potential
performance.
The SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections reflected SYNNEX’ management’s best estimates as to Tech Data’s future performance. The SYNNEX
Adjusted Tech Data Projections were provided to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided to
Duff & Phelps for purposes of their financial analyses and opinion. SYNNEX directed Duff & Phelps to use and rely on the SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data
Projections for such purpose, and such SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections are referred to in the section of this proxy statement “—Opinion of

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted
EBITDA excludes SYNNEX’ post deal synergies and non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections
was reduced by $56, $74, and $110 as a measure of conservatism, but includes stock-based compensation expense of $21, $22, and $22 for the fiscal
year ending 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as adjusted EBITDA, less taxes, less capital expenditures and less increase in
working capital. Numbers may not add up due to rounding.
The SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because
such information was provided to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided to Duff & Phelps for

SYNNEX Synergies
Additionally, in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, SYNNEX’ management prepared certain estimates of potential synergies anticipated by
SYNNEX’ management to result from the Merger in the first three full years following the completion of the Merger and thereafter. These synergies were
provided to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided to Duff & Phelps for the purposes of their
financial analyses and opinion. SYNNEX directed Duff & Phelps to use and rely on these synergies for such purpose, and such synergies are referred to
in the section of this proxy statement “—Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC.”
The following table presents (on a pre-tax basis) a summary of the synergies estimated by SYNNEX management to result from the Merger that were

In addition, SYNNEX’ management prepared final estimates of total potential synergies of the combined business overall following the closing of the
Merger, which are expected to be generated from the transaction cost synergies and cumulative GBO 2 Program cost savings. These estimates included
$100 million in synergies by the end of Year 1 and $200 million in synergies by the end of Year 2. This information was provided to the Board in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction.
The estimated potential synergies resulting from the Merger and the potential synergies of the combined business overall following the Merger, as
prepared by SYNNEX management, are referred to herein as the “SYNNEX Synergies”.
The SYNNEX Synergies reflect numerous assumptions and reflected SYNNEX’ management’s best estimates as to the potential synergies of a combined
company, which SYNNEX made in good faith. The SYNNEX Synergies were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy
statement only because such information was provided, to the Board and, with respect to the potential synergies resulting from the Merger, to Duff &
Phelps for the purpose of its financial analyses and opinion. The SYNNEX Synergies are not reflected in the SYNNEX financial projections or the
SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections.
General
The SYNNEX Financial Projections, SYNNEX Adjusted Tech Data Projections, and SYNNEX Synergies (which we collectively refer to as the “SYNNEX
Projections”), and the Tech Data Projections and Quarterly Information were prepared by SYNNEX’ management or Tech Data’s management for internal
use and were not prepared with a view to public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC,
the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections or generally
accepted accounting principles. The SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections are prospective and should not be relied upon as being necessarily
indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this prospective financial information. The
SYNNEX Projections were prepared by, and are the responsibility of, SYNNEX’ management, and the Tech Data Projections were prepared by, and are the
responsibility of, Tech Data’s management. No independent registered public accounting firm has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled, or applied any
agreed-upon procedures with respect to the SYNNEX Projections or Tech Data Projections nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of
assurance on such information or its achievability. The reports of SYNNEX’ independent registered public accounting firm incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement relate to SYNNEX’ historical financial information and does not extend to the SYNNEX Projections, nor should it be read to do so.

Table of Contents
While the SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections are presented with numeric specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates that
SYNNEX’ or Tech Data’s management made in good faith at the time such projections were prepared with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as the ability to achieve the projected synergies, the
levels of information technology/consumer electronics and outsourced business services spending, competitive conditions in the industry and market
acceptance of SYNNEX’ or Tech Data’s products and services. These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, may be beyond the control of
SYNNEX and Tech Data or any other person, were made as of the date the SYNNEX Projections or Tech Data Projections, respectively were prepared,
and may not be reflective of actual results, either since the date such projections were prepared, now or in the future, in light of changed circumstances,
economic conditions, or other developments.
Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections not to be achieved include risks and
uncertainties relating to SYNNEX’ and Tech Data’s businesses, including their abilities to achieve their respective strategic goals, objectives, targets and
cost savings over applicable periods, customer demand for products, successful and timely development of products, an evolving competitive landscape,
rapid technological change, general business, economic and political conditions and other factors described under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” as well as the risk factors with respect to SYNNEX’ business contained in its most recent SEC filings,
which readers are urged to review, which may be found as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.” In addition, the SYNNEX
Projections and Tech Data Projections cover multiple future years, and such information by its nature is less reliable in predicting each successive year.
The SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections also do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they
were prepared and do not give effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and also do not take into account
the effect of any failure of the Merger to be completed. The SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain
business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the SYNNEX Projections and Tech
Data Projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the SYNNEX Projections or Tech Data Projections will be realized or that actual results will
not be significantly lower than projected. The SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections are not included in this proxy statement to induce any
stockholder to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, Share Issuance Proposal, Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal, Corporate
Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal or Adjournment Proposal, or in favor of any other proposal.
The inclusion of the SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that SYNNEX,
Tech Data, or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives considered the SYNNEX Projections or Tech Data Projections to be
predictive of actual future events, and the SYNNEX Projections should not be relied on as such. Neither SYNNEX, Tech Data, nor any of their
respective affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially
from the SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections, and none of those persons undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or
reconcile the SYNNEX Projections or Tech Data Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such projections were prepared or to
reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying such projections are shown to be in error.
Neither SYNNEX nor Tech Data intend to publicly update or make any other revision to the SYNNEX Projections or Tech Data Projections. Neither
SYNNEX nor Tech Data nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or representatives makes any representation to
any stockholder of SYNNEX or any other person regarding SYNNEX’ and Tech Data’s ultimate performance compared to the SYNNEX Projections and
Tech Data Projections or that the results reflected therein will be achieved. SYNNEX has not made any representation to Tech Data or Tiger Parent, in
the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the SYNNEX Projections. Tiger Parent has not made any representation to SYNNEX in the Merger
Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Tech Data Projections. For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to
place undue, if any, reliance on the SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data Projections.

Table of Contents
The SYNNEX Projections, Tech Data Projections and Quarterly Information contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that SYNNEX or Tech Data
believes are helpful in understanding past financial performance and future results. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation
from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures used by SYNNEX or Tech Data
may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. No reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in the SYNNEX
Projections and Tech Data Projections to GAAP measures were created or used in connection with preparing the SYNNEX Projections and Tech Data
Projections, and there would be inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation.
Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC",69,74
SYNNEX CORP_20210609_DEFM14A_19338736_4236234.Pdf,"Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC","Opinion of Duff & Phelps, LLC
On February 15, 2021, SYNNEX retained Duff & Phelps to serve as an independent financial advisor to the Board specifically to provide to the Board a
fairness opinion in connection with the acquisition by SYNNEX of Tiger Parent for consideration paid to Tiger Holdings consisting of $1.61 billion in cash
and 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock. The $500 million equity contribution by Tiger Holdings to Tiger Parent is excluded when determining
aggregate consideration. On March 16, 2021, Duff & Phelps delivered its Opinion, dated March 16, 2021, to the Board that, as of the date of the Opinion
and subject to and based on the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, limitations of the review undertaken and qualifications
contained in such Opinion, the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to SYNNEX and its
stockholders (without giving effect to any impact of the Merger on any particular stockholder other than in its capacity as a stockholder).
In selecting Duff & Phelps, SYNNEX considered, among other things, the fact that Duff & Phelps is a reputable investment banking firm with experience
in the IT distribution sector and a global leader in providing fairness opinions to boards of directors. Duff & Phelps is continuously engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities and the provision of fairness opinions in connection with various transactions.
The full text of the Opinion is attached hereto as Annex F and is incorporated into this document by reference. The summary of the Opinion set forth
herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Opinion. The Opinion should be read carefully and in its entirety for a discussion of
the procedures followed, assumptions made, other matters considered and limits of the review undertaken by Duff & Phelps in connection with such
Opinion, as well as the qualifications contained therein.
Duff & Phelps’ Opinion was approved by its fairness committee. The Opinion was provided for the information of, and directed to, the Board for its
information and assistance in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the Merger.
In connection with its Opinion, Duff & Phelps made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as it deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances to enable it to render its Opinion. Duff & Phelps also took into account its assessment of general economic, market and financial
conditions, as well as its experience in securities and business valuation in general, and with respect to similar transactions in particular. Duff & Phelps’
procedures, investigations and financial analyses with respect to the preparation of its Opinion included, but were not limited to, the items summarized

To the extent that any of the foregoing assumptions or any of the facts on which the Opinion was based prove to be untrue in any material respect,
Duff & Phelps’ Opinion cannot and should not be relied upon. Furthermore, in Duff & Phelps’ analysis and in connection with the preparation of its
Opinion, Duff & Phelps made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, market and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of any party involved in the Merger.
Duff & Phelps prepared its Opinion effective as of the date thereof. Its Opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date thereof, and Duff & Phelps disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any
person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its Opinion which may come or be brought to the attention of Duff & Phelps after the date thereof.
Duff & Phelps did not evaluate Tech Data’s solvency or conduct an independent appraisal or physical inspection of any of Tech Data’s specific assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise). Duff & Phelps was not requested to, and did not, (i) initiate any discussions with, or solicit any indications of interest
from, third parties with respect to the Merger, the assets, businesses or operations of Tech Data, or any alternatives to the Merger, (ii) negotiate the terms
of the Merger, and therefore, Duff & Phelps assumed that such terms were the most beneficial terms, from SYNNEX’ perspective, that could, under the
circumstances, be negotiated among the parties to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, or (iii) advise the Board or any other party with respect to
alternatives to the Merger.
Duff & Phelps was not expressing any opinion as to the market price or value of SYNNEX common stock (or anything else) after the announcement or the
consummation of the Merger. Duff & Phelps’ Opinion should not be construed as a valuation opinion, a credit rating, a solvency opinion, an analysis of
Tech Data’s credit worthiness, as tax advice, or as accounting advice. Duff & Phelps did not make, and assumed no responsibility to make, any
representation, or render any opinion, as to any legal matter.
In rendering its Opinion, Duff & Phelps was not expressing any opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any of SYNNEX’ or
Tech Data’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger, or with
respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
Duff & Phelps’ Opinion was furnished solely for the use and benefit of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and was not
intended to, and did not and does not, confer any rights or remedies upon any other person, and was not and is not intended to be used, and may not be
used, by any other person or for any other purpose, without Duff & Phelps’ express consent. Duff & Phelps has consented to the inclusion of the
Opinion in its entirety and the description hereof in this proxy statement and any other filing SYNNEX is required to make with the SEC in connection
with the Merger if such inclusion is required by the applicable law. The Opinion (i) did not address the merits of the underlying business decision to enter
into the Merger versus any alternative strategy or transaction; (ii) did not address any transaction related to the Merger; (iii) was not a recommendation
as to how the Board or any stockholder should vote or act with respect to any matters relating to
 
66
Table of Contents
the Merger, or whether to proceed with the Merger or any related transaction; and (iv) did not indicate that the consideration paid is the best possibly
attainable under any circumstances; instead, it merely stated whether the consideration in the Merger was within a range suggested by certain financial
analyses. The decision as to whether to proceed with the Merger or any related transaction may depend on an assessment of factors unrelated to the
financial analysis on which the Opinion was based. Duff & Phelps’ Opinion should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of Duff &
Phelps to any party.
Set forth below is a summary of the material analyses performed by Duff & Phelps in connection with the delivery of its Opinion to the Board. This
summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Opinion, attached hereto as Annex F. While this summary describes the analyses
and factors that Duff & Phelps deemed material in its presentation to the Board, it is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors
considered by Duff & Phelps. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate
and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not
readily susceptible to partial analysis. In arriving at its Opinion, Duff & Phelps did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered
by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Duff & Phelps believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it in rendering the Opinion without
considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its Opinion. The conclusion
reached by Duff & Phelps was based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole, and also on the application of Duff & Phelps’ own experience and
judgment.
The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order for Duff & Phelps’ financial analyses to be fully
understood, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Duff & Phelps’ financial analyses
Valuation Methodologies
Income Approach (Discounted Cash Flow Analysis)
The Income Approach is a valuation technique that provides an estimation of the fair market value of an asset (or business) based on the cash flows that
an asset (or business) can be expected to generate over its remaining useful life. The Income Approach begins with an estimation of the annual cash
flows a market participant would expect the subject asset (or business) to generate over a discrete projection period. The estimated cash flows for each of
the years in the discrete projection period are then converted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return appropriate for the risk of achieving
the projected cash flows. The present value of the estimated cash flows are then added to the present value equivalent of the residual/terminal value of
the asset (if any) or the business at the end of the discrete projection period to arrive at an estimate of fair market value.
For business valuations, the Income Approach is typically applied through a Discounted Cash Flow (which we refer to as “DCF”) analysis. Under the
DCF analysis, the valuation is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows for the expected life of the asset (or business) discounted at a
rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving those cash flows and the time value of money.
Market Approach (Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analysis)
The Market Approach is a valuation technique that provides an estimation of fair market value based on market prices in actual transactions and on
asking prices for assets (or businesses). The valuation process is a comparison and correlation between the subject asset (or business) and other similar
assets (or businesses). Considerations such as time and condition of sale and terms of agreements are analyzed for comparable assets and are adjusted to
arrive at an estimation of the fair market value of the subject asset.

Table of Contents
Valuation Methodologies Utilized
In applying the Income Approach, Duff & Phelps relied on the financial projections, as prepared by Tech Data’s management and reviewed, adjusted and
provided to Duff & Phelps by SYNNEX’ management, as the basis for the DCF analysis.
Duff & Phelps utilized the Market Approach (Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analysis) to select valuation multiples for Tech
Data. Duff & Phelps reviewed the selected public companies’ financial performance and enterprise value to latest twelve months (which we refer to as
“LTM”) and projected revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which we refer to as “EBITDA”) multiples and the
selected M&A transactions’ implied enterprise value to revenue and EBITDA multiples when selecting valuation multiples for Tech Data. In the fairness
analysis, all references to EBITDA include stock-based compensation expenses. In making these selections, Duff & Phelps considered Tech Data’s size,
growth outlook, capital requirements, profit margins, and other characteristics relative to the selected public companies and the targets in the selected
M&A transactions.
Income Approach (Discounted Cash Flow Analysis) Summary
Duff & Phelps performed a DCF analysis of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows attributable to Tech Data for the fiscal years ending
January 31, 2022 through January 31, 2024, with unlevered “free cash flow” defined as cash that is available either to reinvest or to distribute to security
holders. The DCF analysis was used to determine the net present value of estimated future free cash flows utilizing a weighted average cost of capital as
the applicable discount rate. For the purposes of its DCF analysis, Duff & Phelps utilized and relied upon the SYNNEX Financial Projections, which are
described in this proxy statement in the section entitled “—Certain SYNNEX Projections.”
Duff & Phelps estimated the net present value of all cash flows attributable to Tech Data after fiscal year 2024 (which we refer to as the “Terminal Value”)
using a perpetuity growth formula assuming a 2.5% terminal growth rate, which took into consideration Duff & Phelps’ estimate of the expected long-term
growth rate of the economy and Tech Data’s business. Duff & Phelps used discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 11.0%, reflecting Duff & Phelps’ estimate
of Tech Data’s weighted average cost of capital, to discount the projected free cash flows and the Terminal Value. Duff & Phelps estimated Tech Data’s
weighted average cost of capital by estimating the weighted average of Tech Data’s cost of equity (derived using the capital asset pricing model) and
Tech Data’s after-tax cost of debt. Duff & Phelps believes that this range of discount rates is consistent with the rate of return that security holders could
expect to realize on alternative investment opportunities with similar risk profiles. On these assumptions, Duff & Phelps estimates the Terminal Value to be
in the range of $7.4 billion to $8.4 billion.
Based on these assumptions, Duff & Phelps’ DCF analysis resulted in an estimated enterprise value for Tech Data of $7.320 billion to $8.250 billion.
Duff & Phelps further estimated the range of equity value of Tech Data to be $5.482 billion to $6.412 billion by adding pro forma cash of $1.333 billion,
adding the proceeds from a sale lease back transaction of $0.067 billion, subtracting pro forma debt of $2.412 billion, subtracting a working capital
adjustment of $0.606 billion, and subtracting the present value of certain restructuring and other expenses of $0.220 billion.
Market Approach (Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analyses) Summary
Duff & Phelps analyzed selected public companies and selected M&A transactions for purposes of estimating valuation multiples with which to calculate
a range of implied enterprise values of Tech Data. This collective analysis was based on publicly available information and is described in more detail in
the sections that follow.
The companies utilized for comparative purposes in the following analysis were not directly comparable to Tech Data, and the transactions utilized for
comparative purposes in the following analysis were not directly comparable to the Merger. Duff & Phelps does not have access to non-public
information of any of the
 
68
Table of Contents
companies used for comparative purposes. Accordingly, a complete valuation analysis of Tech Data and the Merger cannot rely solely upon a
quantitative review of the selected public companies and selected transactions, but involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics of such companies and targets, as well as other factors that could affect their value relative to that of
Tech Data. Therefore, the selected public companies and selected mergers and acquisitions transactions analysis is subject to certain limitations.
Selected Public Companies Analysis. Duff & Phelps compared certain financial information of Tech Data to corresponding data and ratios from publicly
traded companies that were deemed relevant to its analysis. For purposes of its analysis, Duff & Phelps used certain publicly available historical financial
data and consensus equity analyst estimates for the selected publicly traded companies. Duff & Phelps analyzed a number of factors in comparing Tech
Data to the selected public companies and the targets in the selected mergers and acquisitions transactions, including historical and forecasted growth in
revenue and profits, profit margins and other characteristics that we deemed relevant. The seven companies included in the selected public company
analysis were:
 
Selected Companies
  
•  Arrow Electronics, Inc.
  
•  Avnet, Inc.
  
•  CDW Corporation
  
•  Insight Enterprises, Inc.
  
•  PC Connection, Inc.
  
•  ScanSource, Inc.
  
•  SYNNEX Corporation
Duff & Phelps selected these companies for its analysis based on their relative similarity, primarily in terms of business model, to that of Tech Data.
The tables below summarize certain observed trading multiples and historical and projected financial performance, on an aggregate basis, of the selected
public companies. The estimates for the LTM, next twelve months (which we refer to as “NTM”) and the twelve months after the next twelve months
(which we refer to as “NTM+1”) periods shown in the tables below with respect to the selected public companies were derived based on information for
the 12-month periods ending closest to Tech Data’s fiscal year ends for which information was available. Data related to Tech Data’s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which we refer to as “EBITDA”) were adjusted for purposes of this analysis to eliminate non-recurring
income (expenses) and include stock-based compensation expense.

Selected M&A Transactions Analysis. Duff & Phelps compared Tech Data to the target companies involved in the selected merger and acquisition
transactions listed in the tables below. The selection of these transactions was based on, among other things, the target company’s industry, the relative
size of the transaction compared to the Merger and the availability of public information related to the transaction.
Summary of Selected Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analyses
In order to estimate a range of enterprise values for Tech Data, Duff & Phelps applied valuation multiples to Tech Data’s LTM EBITDA ending January 31,
2021 and projected SYNNEX Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023. Duff & Phelps’ selected valuation
multiples were as follows: LTM EBITDA multiple ranged from 9.0x to 10.0x, NTM EBITDA multiple ranged from 8.5x to 9.5x, and NTM + 1 EBITDA multiple
ranged from 8.0x to 9.0x. Valuation multiples were selected taking into consideration historical and projected financial performance metrics of Tech Data
relative to such metrics of the selected public companies and selected M&A transactions. Rather than applying the average or median multiple from the
public company set, Duff & Phelps selected multiples that, in its judgment, reflected Tech Data’s size, growth outlook, capital requirements, profit
margins, revenue mix, and other characteristics relative to the selected public companies and M&A transactions. Based on these analyses, Duff & Phelps’
selected public companies and M&A transactions analysis resulted in an estimated enterprise value for Tech Data of $7.440 billion to $8.310 billion.
Duff & Phelps further estimated the range of equity value of Tech Data to be $5.602 billion to $6.472 billion by adding pro forma cash of $1.333 billion,
adding the proceeds from a sale lease back transaction of $0.067 billion, subtracting pro forma debt of $2.412 billion, subtracting a working capital
adjustment of $0.606 billion, and subtracting the present value of certain restructuring and other expenses of $0.220 billion.
Summary of Synergies’ Analysis
Duff & Phelps performed a DCF analysis on projected cost synergies net of projected dis-synergies after-tax (which we refer to as “Net Synergies”)
expected to be realized in connection with the Merger for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2022 through January 31, 2024 as provided in the SYNNEX
Financial Projections. Approximately $50 million of cost synergies and $20 million of dis-synergies are expected to be realized in the first fiscal year after
the consummation of the Merger and approximately $100 million of cost synergies and $15 million of dis-synergies are expected to be realized in the
second fiscal year after the consummation of the Merger. Duff & Phelps estimated the Terminal Value of all Net Synergies after the fiscal year ending
January 31, 2024 using a perpetuity growth formula assuming a 2.5%
 
71
Table of Contents
terminal growth rate, which took into consideration an estimate of the expected long-term growth rate of the economy and SYNNEX’ and the Tech Data’s
combined business. Duff & Phelps used discount rates ranging from 11.75% to 13.75%, reflecting Duff & Phelps’ estimate of Tech Data’s cost of equity,
to discount the projected Net Synergies and the Terminal Value of the Net Synergies. Based on these assumptions, Duff & Phelps’ DCF analysis resulted
in an estimated present value for the Net Synergies of $610 million to $740 million.
Duff & Phelps added the present value of Net Synergies to its estimate of the range of equity value of Tech Data to estimate the total value to be received
by SYNNEX in the Merger.
Summary of Financial Analysis
Based on Duff & Phelps’ analysis, the concluded range of total value to be received by the Company, excluding the Net Synergies, was estimated to be
$5.542 billion to $6.442 billion. Based on Duff & Phelps’ analysis, the concluded range of total value to be received by the Company, including the Net
Synergies, was estimated to be $6.152 billion to $7.182 billion. The total consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was estimated to be
$6.127 billion based on the Company’s common share price of $102.67 as of March 12, 2021.
 
LOGO
Duff & Phelps noted that the consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the Merger was below the range of the values indicated by its analyses including
Net Synergies.
Duff & Phelps’ Opinion was only one of the many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Board.
Fees and Expenses
As compensation for Duff & Phelps’ services in connection with the rendering of its Opinion to the Board, SYNNEX agreed to pay Duff & Phelps a fee of
$600,000. The fee was payable upon Duff & Phelps informing the Board that it was prepared to deliver its Opinion.
No portion of Duff & Phelps’ fee is refundable or contingent upon the consummation of a transaction or the conclusion reached in the Opinion.
Furthermore, Duff & Phelps is entitled to be paid additional fees at Duff & Phelps’ standard hourly rates for any time incurred should Duff & Phelps be
called upon to support its findings subsequent to the delivery of its
 
72
Table of Contents
Opinion and/or assist in the preparation or review of documents associated with the Merger. SYNNEX has also agreed to reimburse Duff & Phelps for its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by Duff & Phelps in connection with the
engagement. SYNNEX has also agreed to indemnify Duff & Phelps for certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
The terms of the fee arrangements with Duff & Phelps, which SYNNEX believes are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm’s
length, and the Board is aware of these fee arrangements.
Disclosure of Prior Relationships
During the two years preceding the date of its Opinion, Duff & Phelps provided financial opinions and valuation services to SYNNEX, and provided
valuation services to Tech Data’s private equity sponsor, Apollo and its affiliates (which we collectively refer to as “Apollo”). For these prior
engagements, Duff & Phelps received customary fees, expense reimbursement, and indemnification. Total fees paid by each of SYNNEX and Apollo were
immaterial to Duff & Phelps’ total revenues.

Members of our Board and our executive officers have various interests in the Merger described in this section that may be in addition to, or different
from, the interests of SYNNEX’ stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they
approved the Merger Agreement. These interests are described below under “Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance” and are the only
additional or varying interests in the Merger held by the directors and executive officers. Other than Mr. Hume, who will be the Chief Executive Officer of
the combined companies, and Mr. Polk, who will be the Chairman of the Board of the combined companies (see Section 2.13 of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger attached as Annex A), there have been no determinations as to who will serve on the Board or as executive officers following the Merger, nor as
to compensation of the Board or the executive officers following the Merger.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and executive officers. These agreements require us to indemnify
these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance
expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. We also intend to enter into indemnification

Financing",84,84
SYNNEX CORP_20210609_DEFM14A_19338736_4236234.Pdf,Financing,"Financing
SYNNEX anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to directly or indirectly pay, repay, refinance or repurchase, as applicable, certain existing of
its and Tech Data’s indebtedness (including indebtedness of their respective subsidiaries) will be approximately $1,185 million. These amounts will be
funded through some or all of (i) the term loan portion of the takeout facility, (ii) cash on hand and (iii) the proceeds that SYNNEX intends to obtain from
other financings or offerings of debt securities in lieu of borrowing under the Tranche C of the Bridge Facility. Remaining amounts under the takeout
facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
Pursuant to the Bridge Commitment Letter for the Bridge Facility, SYNNEX received commitments for an aggregate principal amount of $7.5 billion in
financing, consisting of $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured term bridge loans and $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of
senior unsecured revolving credit commitments, the availability of which was and is subject to reduction upon the consummation of the Permanent
Financing pursuant to the terms set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter. The Bridge Facility originally consisted of three different tranches of senior
unsecured loans: Tranche A was for a $1.5 billion senior unsecured term loan; Tranche B was for a $3.5 billion senior unsecured revolving loan; and
Tranche C is for a $2.5 billion senior unsecured term loan. On April 16, 2021, SYNNEX entered into the takeout facility and pursuant to the terms of the
Bridge Commitment Letter, the commitments with respect to Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility were reduced to zero. As a result of the
termination of both Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility, only Tranche C of the Bridge Facility remains outstanding and the debt financing
previously committed to under Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bridge Facility are instead committed to be provided under the takeout facility.
Pursuant to the takeout facility, SYNNEX received commitments for the extension of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility not to exceed an
aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion, which revolving credit facility may, subject to the lenders’ discretion, potentially be increased by up to an
aggregate amount of $500 million and for the extension of a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. The
commitments under the takeout facility are subject to customary conditions. The borrower under the takeout facility is SYNNEX.
The commitments under the takeout facility terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) with respect to the revolving commitments, the fifth anniversary of
the closing date (subject, to two one-year extensions upon
 
74Table of Contents
SYNNEX’ prior notice to the lenders and the agreement of the lenders to extend such maturity date), (ii) in the event SYNNEX voluntarily elects to reduce
such commitments to zero, on such date, or subject to certain conditions, following an event of default, (iii) if the closing does not occur prior to such
date, five business days after the termination date of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated by SYNNEX in a
signed writing in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
At this time, SYNNEX has not yet determined whether Tranche C of the Bridge Facility will be required to be utilized in conjunction with the takeout
facility to provide the debt financing required to refinance certain indebtedness required to consummate the proposed transactions because such
determination will be dependent on future market conditions. SYNNEX intends to obtain additional financing or issue debt securities in lieu of utilizing
Tranche C of the Bridge Facility, however, there is no assurance that such alternative arrangements will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If
Tranche C of the Bridge Facility is utilized there can be no assurance that any replacement or supplemental financing in lieu of or to refinance Tranche C
of the Bridge Facility will be available to SYNNEX on acceptable terms or at all. SYNNEX’ ability to obtain additional debt financing, including financing
to refinance, replace or supplement Tranche C of the Bridge Facility, will be subject to various factors, including market conditions and operating
performance.
The funding under either the Bridge Commitment Letter or the takeout facility, as applicable, is subject to customary closing conditions, including
conditions that do not relate directly to the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement.
Takeout Facility
The proceeds of the loans under the takeout facility will be used to provide a portion of the debt financing required to refinance certain indebtedness of
SYNNEX and Tech Data, which is required to consummate the proposed transaction, together with the payment of related fees and expenses. After the
closing date, the revolving credit facility will, subject to customary conditions, be available for general corporate purposes or any other purpose not
prohibited by the takeout facility.
Interest Rate
The interest rate per annum applicable to the loans under the takeout facility are, at SYNNEX’ option, equal to either a base rate or a LIBOR (or successor)
rate plus an applicable margin, which may (in the case of LIBOR loans) range from 1.125% to 1.75%, based on SYNNEX’ public debt rating (as defined in
the New Credit Agreement). The applicable margin on base rate loans is 1.00% less than the corresponding margin on LIBOR (or successor rate) based
loans.
Amortization and Prepayments
The maturity of the take out facility will be five years after the closing date, subject, in the case of the revolving credit facility, to two one-year extensions
upon SYNNEX’ prior notice to the lenders and the agreement of the lenders to extend such maturity date. Once advanced, the outstanding principal
amount of the term loan under the takeout facility will be payable in equal quarterly amounts equal to 1.25% of the principal outstanding balance,
commencing on the last day of the first full fiscal quarter after the closing date, with the outstanding principal amount of the term loans due in full on the
maturity date. The term loan portion of the takeout facility is not subject to mandatory prepayment. SYNNEX may prepay all or any portion of the term
loans under the takeout facility prior to maturity without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of any LIBOR breakage costs of the lenders.

Table of Contents
Conditions to Closing
The obligation of the lenders to fund the loans under the takeout facility on the closing date is subject, among other things, to:
 
 
•
 consummation of the Merger substantially concurrently with the closing and funding of the takeout facility in all material respects in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, without any amendment or modification thereto which is materially adverse to the interests of the
lenders under the takeout facilities, who are collectively referred to in this proxy statement as the takeout lenders, unless approved by the
agent under the takeout facility (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
 
 
•
 the accuracy of certain limited representations and warranties;
 
 
•

•
 since March 22, 2021, no material adverse effect on Tech Data.
For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Financing.”
Certain Covenants and Events of Default
The takeout facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default (including relating to a change of control) that are
customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. Among other things, such negative covenants restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the
ability of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, to create liens, incur indebtedness (solely with respect to any non-guarantor subsidiary of SYNNEX), mergers or
consolidations, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or change the nature of their business. In addition, the takeout facility contains financial
covenants which require SYNNEX to maintain at the end of any of its fiscal quarters commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending after entry into
the takeout facility, (i) a consolidated leverage ratio that may not exceed 4.25 to 1.00 for the first four full fiscal quarters following entry into the takeout
facility and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter, and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.50 to 1.00.

Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and Other U.S. Antitrust Authorities
Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting period requirements have expired or been
terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the FTC and the DOJ. A transaction notifiable under the HSR
Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification
forms or the early termination of that waiting period. This initial waiting period may be extended for an additional 30 days should the acquiring person
withdraw its filing before expiration of the initial 30 days and promptly refile it. If the FTC or DOJ issues a Request for Additional Information and
Documentary Material prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period (including a re-filing period after withdrawing the initial HSR filings), the parties
must observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the request for
additional information, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier. Under the Merger Agreement, completion of the Merger is conditioned on the HSR
Act Clearance.
Neither SYNNEX nor Tiger Parent will agree, directly or indirectly, to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable law or to any timing
agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
 
76Table of Contents
governmental entity, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
On April 2, 2021, SYNNEX and Tiger Parent filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger with the FTC
and DOJ, which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. At the end of the initial 30-day waiting period, SYNNEX pulled and re-filed its
notification and report form under the HSR Act, with the consent of Tiger Parent, to allow the FTC and DOJ an additional 30 days to review the Merger.
This additional 30-day period expired on June 4, 2021. Additionally, the Merger has received clearance for some of the non-U.S. regulatory filings, while
other non-U.S. regulatory clearances remain outstanding.
At any time before or after the Merger is completed, the FTC or DOJ could take action under U.S. federal antitrust laws in opposition to the Merger,
including seeking to enjoin completion of the Merger, condition adoption of the Merger Agreement upon the divestiture of assets of Tiger Parent,
SYNNEX or their respective subsidiaries or impose restrictions on SYNNEX’ post-Merger operations or other conditions. In addition, U.S. state attorneys
general could take such action under state antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking
to enjoin completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or conditions. Private parties also may seek to take legal
action under the U.S. federal or state antitrust laws under some circumstances.
For a description of SYNNEX’ and Tiger Parent’s respective obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to regulatory approvals, see the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Covenant and Agreements—Efforts to Complete the Merger.”

SYNNEX’ Stockholders Meeting
As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 45 days, after the date of the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX agreed to prepare, in consultation with
Tiger Parent, and file with the SEC the preliminary proxy statement. Furthermore, as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 45 days, after the
expiration of the 10-day waiting period promulgated under the Exchange Act or the date on which SYNNEX learns the SEC has no further comments on
the proxy statement, SYNNEX agreed to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of seeking the adoption
of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate Opportunity
Charter Amendment Proposal. Unless the Board has made a change of recommendation as described under the section entitled “—Change of
Recommendation,” SYNNEX will recommend that its stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal, the Authorized
Share Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal, and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of such proposals and take all other action necessary or advisable to obtain such stockholder approval.
Stock Exchange Listing
SYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of SYNNEX common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Merger.
No Solicitation
Each of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent mutually agreed to immediately cease discussions or negotiations with any other person that may have been ongoing
prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, with respect to any alternative acquisition proposal of SYNNEX or Tiger Parent, as applicable, and to request
the return or destruction of any confidential information previously delivered to any such person.
Each of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent has agreed that it will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and other respective representatives not to, directly
or indirectly:
 
 
•
 initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any alternative acquisition proposal;
 
 
•
 engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any alternative acquisition proposal;
 
 
•
 provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with any person relating to any
alternative acquisition proposal; or
 
 
•
 approve or enter into any acquisition agreement, term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other similar agreement in
connection with or relating to any alternative acquisition proposal (unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated).
If, prior to the receipt of SYNNEX’ stockholder approval, SYNNEX receives a bona fide written alternative acquisition proposal not solicited in violation
its non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement,
 
87
Table of Contents
SYNNEX may furnish confidential or nonpublic information to, and participate in such negotiations or discussions with, the person making the
alternative acquisition proposal, if the Board concludes in good faith, after consulting with such outside advisors as it determines in good faith to be
reasonably necessary, that taking such actions would be required to comply with its fiduciary duties. Before furnishing any confidential or nonpublic
information, SYNNEX may and shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such alternative acquisition proposal that contains
terms no less favorable than the confidentiality agreement between SYNNEX and Tiger Parent (provides that such confidentiality agreement shall not
give such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with SYNNEX, and shall otherwise permit SYNNEX to comply with its obligations under the
Merger Agreement).
SYNNEX must promptly (within 24 hours) advise Tiger Parent if it has received any alternative acquisition proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity
of the person making such inquiry or alternative acquisition proposal). SYNNEX must further provide Tiger Parent with an unredacted copy of any such
alternative acquisition proposal and any draft agreements or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or alternative acquisition
proposal. SYNNEX must keep Tiger Parent apprised of any material developments and negotiations, including any (i) amendment or modification to the
economic terms of such alternative acquisition proposal or (ii) any other material amendment or modification to the terms us such proposal.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, an alternative acquisition proposal means, with respect to SYNNEX or Tiger Parent, as applicable (other than the
Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement), any proposal or offer from third party, relating to
 
 
•
 any acquisition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its subsidiaries;
 
 
•
 any acquisition twenty percent 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the party;
 
 
•
 any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party or its affiliates beneficially owning 20% or more of
any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more
of the consolidated assets of the party; or
 
 
•
 a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving a party or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the party, which would result in the stockholders of such party prior to such transaction ceasing to own at least 80%,
directly or indirectly, of such party or its subsidiaries.
Change of Recommendation
Subject to the following paragraph, the Board may not change its recommendation that SYNNEX’ stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate Opportunity Charter
Amendment Proposal. Under the Merger Agreement, a change in recommendation will occur if the Board (i) withholds, withdraws, modifies or qualifies in
a manner adverse to Tiger Parent its recommendation, (ii) fails to make its recommendation in this proxy statement, (iii) adopts, approves, recommends or
endorses an alternative acquisition proposal or publicly announces an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an alternative acquisition
proposal, (iv) if an alternative acquisition proposal is made public, fails to publicly (and without qualification) disapprove of such alternative acquisition
proposal or reaffirm its recommendation within 10 business days, or (v) publicly proposes to do any of the foregoing.

Prior to obtaining the approval of SYNNEX’ stockholders, the Board may make a change of recommendation (i) in connection with a bona fide, written
alternative acquisition proposal (with applicable thresholds in the definition of alternative acquisition proposal equal to 80% instead of 25%) that was not
solicited in violation of the non-solicitation obligations described above, which the Board determines in good faith (after consulting with such outside
advisors as it determines to be reasonably necessary) to be more favorable to SYNNEX and its stockholders than the Merger from a financial point of
view and is reasonably likely to be consummated, in each case, taking into account all relevant factors (including the terms and conditions of such
alternative acquisition proposal and the Merger Agreement and any changes to the terms of Merger Agreement proposed by Tiger Parent), which is
referred to as a “superior acquisition proposal” or (ii) in response to a material event, change, effect, development or occurrence, subject to certain
exceptions relating to regulatory approvals, that was not known to the Board prior to the date of the Merger Agreement and does not relate to or involve
an alternative acquisition proposal, which we refer to as an “intervening event.”
Prior to making a change in recommendation, the Board must (i) provide Tiger Parent with four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to
change its recommendation and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to change its recommendation
(including, if the change of recommendation is in response to a superior acquisition proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of
the third party making the superior acquisition proposal, including any amendment or modification to the economic terms of, or any other material
amendment or modification to, such superior acquisition proposal) and (ii) at the end of the four business days’ notice period, take into account any
amendment or modification to the Merger Agreement proposed by Tiger Parent and determine in good faith, after consulting with such outside advisors
as it determines reasonably necessary, that changing its recommendation would nevertheless be required to comply with its fiduciary duties (if there is a
subsequent change to the economic terms of or any other material amendment to the superior acquisition proposal, it will be considered a new superior
acquisition proposal, and the Board must provide Tiger Parent with a new two business days’ notice period).
Even if the Board changes its recommendation, unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, the special meeting of the stockholders of SYNNEX shall be
convened and the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment Proposal and the Corporate
Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal shall be submitted to SYNNEX’ stockholders.
Efforts to Complete the Merger
SYNNEX and Tiger Parent have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all necessary
actions, and do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as
promptly as practicable; (ii) make, or cause to be made, the registrations, declarations and filings required for HSR Act Clearance, the required filings, and
the required consents, (iii) prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all third parties and governmental entities which are necessary or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals, clearances and authorizations of governmental entities, and (iv) seek to avoid or prevent the initiation of any investigation, claim, action, suit,
arbitration, litigation or proceeding by or before any governmental entity challenging Merger Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
In furtherance of the parties’ reasonable best efforts, each of SYNNEX, Tiger Parent, and their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent required
in order to obtain HSR Act Clearance, the required filings, and the required consents, or any other approvals of a governmental entity required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has agreed to (i) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any
sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other encumbrance, or holding separate, of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein; and (ii) take or agree to
 
89
Table of Contents
take any other action, agree or consent to, make any concession in respect of, or permit or suffer to exist any condition or requirement setting forth, any
limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interest therein (which we collectively refer to as “regulatory concessions”). However, neither party nor its subsidiaries are
required to, and neither party shall without the consent of the other party, agree or consent to a regulatory concession (including any divesture) that
would be or would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the combined company, taken as a whole, following the
Merger.
SYNNEX and Tiger Parent have agreed to use reasonable best efforts (until the Merger Agreement is terminated) to (i) oppose or defend against any
proceeding by any governmental entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or (ii) overturn any regulatory order by any governmental
entity preventing consummation of the Merger, including by defending against or seeking to vacate, overturn, terminate or appeal any order that would
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.
The parties have also agreed to not, and to cause their respective subsidiaries to not, acquire or agree to acquire, by merger or consolidation, or by
purchasing the assets or equity of, any business, corporation, partnership, association, or business organization or division, or take any other similar
action, if taking such action would reasonably be expected to (i) materially delay obtaining, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, HSR Act
Clearance, the required filings, the required consents, or any other authorizations, consents, orders, clearances or approvals of a governmental entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) increase, in any material respect, the risk of any governmental
entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) increase the risk, in any material
respect, of not being able to remove an order, on appeal or otherwise, that prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; or (iv) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Financing
Financing Not a Condition to the Merger
In connection with its entry into the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX entered into a Bridge Commitment Letter, under which Citi and certain other financing
institutions joining thereto pursuant to the terms thereof committed to provide $7.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured
commitments. On April 16, 2021, SYNNEX entered into a $5.0 billion takeout facility in the aggregate, pursuant to which the takeout lenders have
committed to provide a senior unsecured revolving credit facility not to exceed an aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion and a senior unsecured term
loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. Upon entry into the takeout facility, the commitments under the Bridge Commitment
Letter were reduced by $5.0 billion to $2.5 billion. The applicable lenders’ obligations to fund their respective remaining commitments under the Bridge
Commitment Letter and under the takeout facility are subject to several conditions as set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter and in the takeout facility,
including, among others, completion of the Merger, the non-occurrence of a material adverse effect on Tech Data, the accuracy of certain representations
and warranties related to both SYNNEX and Tech Data and SYNNEX’ and Tech Data’s delivery of certain financial statements.
The availability of the term loan commitments under the Bridge Commitment Letter and the loans under the takeout facility are not conditions to SYNNEX’
or either Merger Sub’s respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.
Cooperation of SYNNEX
Until the closing or the termination of the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, advisable and proper in connection with the
 
90
Table of Contents
arrangement, marketing and consummation of the issuance of any debt securities and/or the incurrence of any other Permanent Financing by SYNNEX
that is reasonably acceptable to SYNNEX and Tiger Parent in lieu of the Financing.
Furthermore, in the event any funds required to satisfy the transaction uses become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter or the financing agreements, SYNNEX has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain Alternative Financing in an amount
sufficient to allow it to satisfy the transaction uses, and to obtain the Alternative Commitment Letter on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to
SYNNEX and Tiger Parent.
SYNNEX has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing in an amount sufficient (together with any other cash sources available to SYNNEX or its
subsidiaries) to (i) repay, prepay, refinance, redeem or otherwise satisfy any indebtedness of SYNNEX, Tiger Parent or their respective subsidiaries
contemplated or required to be satisfied in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) pay all fees
and expenses of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries related to or arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
that are required to be paid at closing, and (iii) pay all other amounts required to be paid by SYNNEX and its subsidiaries pursuant to or in connection
with the Merger Agreement at closing (which we refer to collectively as the “transaction uses”), on terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related to the Financing (which we refer to collectively, as the context may require for any applicable
Financing, as the “financing agreements”).
In furtherance of the foregoing, SYNNEX has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect, until closing, the Commitment Letter or the
financing agreements, as applicable, (ii) materially comply with the obligations that are set forth in the Commitment Letter and the financing agreements
that are applicable to SYNNEX and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent in the Commitment Letter and the financing agreements that are
within its control, and (iii) to the extent necessary to satisfy the transaction uses, fully enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and the financing
agreements. SYNNEX has agreed that it will not, prior to the closing, release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the
Commitment Letter or the financing agreements without the consent of Tiger Parent (other than in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter as
in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement).
SYNNEX has agreed to give Tiger Parent prompt written notice upon it obtaining knowledge of any of the following:
 
 
•
 any material breach (or threatened in writing material breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or the financing agreements;
 
 
•
 any actual or threatened in writing withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by any of the lenders;
 
 
•
 any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the financing parties (on the one hand) and SYNNEX or any of its affiliates
(on the other hand) party to the Commitment Letter or the financing agreements; and
 
 
•
 any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Commitment Letter or the financing agreements.
Except for certain enumerated exceptions, SYNNEX has agreed to not, without the prior written consent of Tiger Parent, amend, modify, supplement,
restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any waiver under the Commitment Letter or any financing agreement, which consent in the case of an
amendment, modification or restatement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such amendment, modification or
 
91
Table of Contents
restatement would not (i) reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede, or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by Merger Agreement, materially delay or impair the availability of the Financing or make the funding of the Financing at the
closing less likely to occur, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing such that SYNNEX would have insufficient funds to satisfy the transaction
uses, (iii) contain additional or modified conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing relative to those set forth in the Commitment Letter as in
effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or (iv) reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of SYNNEX to enforce or cause the
enforcement of its rights under the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements
Cooperation of Tiger Parent
Subject to certain limitations and other caveats, Tiger Parent has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to (and cause its subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors to) cooperate with SYNNEX as necessary in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing or any Permanent Financing as may be customary and reasonably requested by SYNNEX in writing, including:
 
 
•
 making appropriate officers or members of the management team available for participation at reasonable times and locations mutually
agreed in a reasonable number of meetings, lender and investor presentations, conference calls, road show presentations, due diligence
sessions and meetings with rating agencies;
 
 
•
 providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of any reasonable and customary bank information memoranda or private placement
memoranda, rating agency presentations, marketing and/or syndication materials, in each case with respect to Tiger Parent and its
subsidiaries;
 
 
•
 providing reasonable assistance preparing a customary prospectus, offering memorandum, private placement memorandum or other
document to be used in connection with an offering suitable for use in a customary road show relating to debt securities;
 
 
•
 assisting SYNNEX in the preparation of customary pro forma financial statements and projections necessary in connection with the
Financing and/or the Permanent Financing;
 
 
•
 using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its accountants to cooperate in the provision of any customary “comfort” in respect of
financial information of Tiger Parent or any of its subsidiaries included in any offering document;
 
 
•
 assisting in the preparation and negotiation and execution and delivery of any definitive financing documents;
 
 
•
 taking corporate and other actions reasonably necessary to permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the funding of the Financing and/or
any Permanent Financing on the closing date; and
 
 
•
 providing all material documentation and other information about Tiger Parent to satisfy applicable “beneficial ownership,” “know your
customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations.
Employee Benefits Matters
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, SYNNEX and Tiger Parent have agreed to cooperate in good faith to review, evaluate and analyzing SYNNEX’
and Tiger Parent’s respective employee benefit plans with a view towards developing appropriate new employee benefit plans, or selecting which if the
parties’ respective existing employee benefit plans, that will apply with respect to employees of the combined company following the Merger (which we
refer to collectively as the “new benefit plans”). The combined company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the new benefit plans, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, to (i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors,
including duties, geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, and (ii) not discriminate between employees who were previously employed by
SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and those employed by Tiger Parent and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, at the time of the Merger.
 
92
Table of Contents
During the six month period immediately following the Merger, the combined company shall provide each employee of Tiger Parent and each employee of
SYNNEX (and their respective subsidiaries) who continues to remain employed by the combined company (each of whom we refer to as a “Legacy
Employee”), with an annual base salary or wage rate and severance benefits (in the event that such Legacy Employee terminated during the six month
period following the Merger), in each case, that are no less favorable than the greater of (i) such Legacy Employee’s salary or wage rate, as applicable,
and severance entitlement as of immediately prior to the Merger or (ii) the salary or wage rate, as applicable, and severance entitlement in effect for
similarly situated employees of the combined company.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, with respect to any new benefit plans that any Legacy Employees first become eligible to participate on or
after the Merger, and that such Legacy Employee did not participate in prior to the Merger, the parties have agreed that the combined company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Legacy Employees and their eligible dependents (unless such preexisting conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous SYNNEX or Tiger Parent employee benefit plan), (ii) provide the Legacy Employees and their eligible dependents with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Merger under a SYNNEX or Tiger Parent employee benefit plan in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any new benefit plans, and (iii) recognize all service of the Legacy Employees with Tiger Parent or
SYNNEX and their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all purposes in any new benefit plan. However, service recognition will not apply (a) to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (b) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan,
(c) for purposes of any benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (d) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits,
or (e) to the extent it would require any retroactive contributions.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
For at least six years after the Effective Time, the parties have agreed to cause the combined company to indemnify and hold harmless, and advance
expenses to, such persons that are indemnified as of the date of the Merger Agreement by Tiger Parent pursuant to the organizational documents of Tiger
Parent or its subsidiaries or any existing and specified indemnification agreements, and such persons that are indemnified as of the date of the Merger
Agreement by SYNNEX pursuant to the organizational documents of SYNNEX or its subsidiaries or any existing and specified indemnification
agreements against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any threatened in writing or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer
or employee of SYNNEX, Tiger Parent, or their respective subsidiaries pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Merger, including the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Further, for at least six years after the Merger, the parties have agreed to cause the combined company to maintain in effect, insurance coverage
equivalent to the coverage under the policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Tiger Parent as of the date of the Merger
Agreement with respect to claims arising at or prior to the Merger, subject to an annual cap of 300% of the annual premium of Tiger Parent’s insurance
policy. If the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed the annual cap, the combined company will obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost equal to the annual cap. In the alternative, the combined company may, or at SYNNEX request, obtain a six year “tail” policy
under Tiger Parent’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described above; provided that the premium
payable for such “tail” policy does not exceed the annual cap.
Equity Contribution
Tiger Parent has agreed to cause one or more of its applicable affiliates to make an equity contribution to Tiger Parent prior to the Effective Time of at least
$500,000,000 in cash, in exchange for shares of Tiger Parent’s
 
93
Table of Contents
common stock (which shall in no way increase the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement).
Other Covenants

other matters including, but not limited to:

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 actions to be taken by SYNNEX and Tiger Parent in connection with and with respect to Sections 16(a) and 16(b) of the Exchange Act;
 
 
•
 resubmission of the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Proposal to SYNNEX’ stockholders at the next annual meeting, if such
proposal is not approved at the special meeting;

The Investor Rights Agreement provides that following the closing, the Board shall be comprised of eleven directors, and Tiger Holdings shall have the
right to nominate a certain number of directors, depending on the percentage of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock held by Tiger
Holdings or certain of its affiliates. Specifically, Tiger Holdings shall have the right to nominate:
 
 
(i)
up to four directors, if it owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, two of which must be “independent”
directors, within the meaning of the NYSE;
 
 
(ii)
up to three directors, if it owns between 20% and 30% of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, one of which must be an
independent director;
 
 
(iii)
up to two directors, if it owns between 10% and 20% of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock;
 
 
(iv)
up to one director, if it owns between 5% and 10% of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock.
The initial directors nominated by Tiger Holdings shall be mutually acceptable to SYNNEX and any replacement director nominated by Tiger Holdings
shall be approved by a majority of the directors on the Board that are not nominated by Tiger Holdings.
Of the remaining directors, who are not nominated by Tiger Holdings, one director shall be the then-serving Chief Executive Officer of SYNNEX, who will
initially be Mr. Richard Hume, effective upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the other directors will be
nominated in accordance with the provisions of SYNNEX’ bylaws and SYNNEX Certificate of Incorporation, provided that the members of the Board, as
of immediately prior to the Merger, shall determine who shall remain on, or be appointed to, the Board following the Merger to hold the director positions
that are not nominated by Tiger Holdings. Other than Mr. Hume and Mr. Polk, there have been no determinations as to who will serve on the Board
following the Merger.
In the event the size of the Board is increased or decreased to other than eleven directors, the number of directors who may be nominated by Tiger
Holdings will be proportionately increased or decreased to most closely equal the percentage of the Board originally composed of directors nominated by
Tiger Holdings.
The Board may determine the composition and makeup of any committees of the Board. The lead independent director will also be selected by the Board.
Directors nominated by Tiger Holdings must fulfill their pro rata portion of any diversity requirements pursuant to law, stock exchange rules, or other

SYNNEX UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",111,113
SYNNEX CORP_20210609_DEFM14A_19338736_4236234.Pdf,SYNNEX UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,"SYNNEX UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The SYNNEX Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, which are referred to in this proxy statement as the Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Statements, presented below are derived from the continuing operations of the historical consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and the
parent company of Tech Data Corporation, Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation (which we refer to as “Tiger Parent”). The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements are prepared as a business combination and SYNNEX has been treated as the acquirer in the merger for accounting purposes. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared as if SYNNEX’ acquisition of Tiger Parent had been completed on
December 1, 2019, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared as if SYNNEX’ acquisition of Tiger Parent had
been completed on February 28, 2021.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are developed from and should be read in conjunction with the following historical consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes of SYNNEX filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”): (a) the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2021; (b) the
audited consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2020; and (c) the
audited consolidated financial statements of Tiger Parent as of January 31, 2021 and for each of the periods in the three-year period then ended, which are
included herein below.
The SYNNEX column in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 was derived from
continuing operations of the consolidated financial statements included in Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021. The Tiger Parent column in
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 was derived by combining the
historical predecessor consolidated statement of operations for the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 with the successor consolidated
financial statements for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 included herein below. The Tiger Parent column in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2021 was derived from the unaudited historical successor
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended January 31, 2021.
SYNNEX and Tiger Parent have different fiscal years. SYNNEX’ fiscal year ends on November 30, whereas Tiger Parent’s fiscal year ends on January 31.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations have been prepared utilizing period ends that differ by less
than 93 days, as permitted by Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of February 28, 2021
combines SYNNEX’ balance sheet as of February 28, 2021 with the Tiger Parent balance sheet as of January 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 combines continuing operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 for
SYNNEX and the pro forma predecessor and successor operations for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 for Tiger Parent. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statement of operations for the three months ended February 28, 2021 combines continuing operations for the three months
ended February 28, 2021 for SYNNEX and the successor results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2021 for Tiger Parent.
As of the date of this proxy statement, SYNNEX has not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at final estimates of the fair market
value of Tiger Parent’s assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has it identified all
adjustments necessary to conform Tiger Parent to SYNNEX’ accounting policies. As indicated in Note 4 to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements, based on information currently available, SYNNEX has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of
Tiger Parent to reflect preliminary estimates of fair values necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, with the excess of the
purchase price over the adjusted historical net assets of Tiger Parent recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Statements once the Merger is completed and SYNNEX has determined the final purchase price
 
103Table of Contents
for Tiger Parent, has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and has identified any additional
conforming accounting policy changes for Tiger Parent. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements have been prepared to include factually supportable adjustments which give effect to events that are
directly attributable to the merger regardless of whether they are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results or are non-recurring.
The pro forma financial information has been prepared by SYNNEX for illustrative and informational purposes only, in accordance with Regulation S-X
Article 11, Pro Forma Financial Information, as amended by the final rule, “Amendments to Financial Disclosures About Acquired and Disposed
Businesses,” as adopted by the SEC on May 21, 2020 (which we refer to as “Article 11”). The pro forma financial information, based on various
adjustments and assumptions, is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what SYNNEX’ consolidated statements of
operations or consolidated statement of financial condition actually would have been had the Merger, the borrowings drawdown and the stock issuance
been completed as of the dates presented or will be for any future periods. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements do not purport to project the
future financial position or operating results of SYNNEX following the completion of the Merger and do not include the realization of cost savings from
operating efficiencies, revenue synergies or other integration costs expected to result from the Tiger Parent acquisition. The pro forma financial
information does not include adjustments to reflect any potential synergies or dis-synergies cost in connection with the Merger.

NOTES TO THE SYNNEX UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(except for per share amounts and as otherwise stated, currency and share amounts in thousands)
(amounts may not add or compute due to rounding)
Note 1. Description of the Transaction
On March 22, 2021, SYNNEX, Spire Sub I, Inc., Spire Sub II, LLC, and Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, which is the parent corporation of Tech Data
Corporation (which we refer to as “Tiger Parent”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement, Spire Sub I will merge with and into the Tiger Parent, with the resulting company surviving the initial merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of SYNNEX, followed immediately by the merger of this combined corporation with and into Spire Sub II, LLC. Upon the closing of the
transaction, this surviving company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX (which we refer to as the “Merger”).
On June 30, 2020, affiliates of certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management Inc. (which we refer to as “Apollo”) acquired Tiger
Parent. Upon completion of the Merger, Apollo, the sole stockholder that owns Tiger Parent, will receive (1) $1,610,000 in cash plus (2) 44,000 shares of
common stock of SYNNEX.
The aggregate purchase consideration in the Merger is based on an estimated SYNNEX closing price and cash consideration aggregating $7,107,800 (see
Note 3).
To finance the Merger and repay certain indebtedness, SYNNEX has obtained long-term term financing commitments of $7,500,000 in the aggregate (see
Note 5A).
Note 2. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent. The
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are prepared as a business combination using the acquisition method, and SYNNEX has been treated as the
acquirer for accounting purposes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared as if SYNNEX’
acquisition of Tiger Parent had been completed on December 1, 2019, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared
as if SYNNEX’ acquisition of Tiger Parent had been completed on February 28, 2021.
As of the date of this proxy statement, SYNNEX has not performed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the final estimates of the fair
value of the Tiger Parent assets to be acquired, the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price. As indicated in Note 5 to the
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, SYNNEX has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of Tiger
Parent to reflect preliminary estimates of fair value necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, with the excess of the purchase
price over the adjusted historical net assets of Tiger Parent, recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements once the Merger is completed and SYNNEX has determined the final purchase price for Tiger Parent and has completed the valuation studies
necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any additional conforming accounting policy changes for Tiger Parent. There
can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared to reflect adjustments to SYNNEX’ historical consolidated
financial information that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition of Tiger Parent, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company.
 
108
Table of Contents
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not give effect to any cost savings
from operating efficiencies, revenue synergies or costs for the integration of SYNNEX and Tiger Parent’s operations. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of SYNNEX
would have been had the Tiger Parent Merger occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of
operations or consolidated financial position. Although SYNNEX projects that significant cost savings will result from the Merger, there can be no
assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. Any restructuring or integration costs will be expensed in the appropriate accounting periods after
completion of the Merger.
Accounting periods presented
SYNNEX and Tiger Parent have different fiscal years. SYNNEX’ fiscal year ends on November 30, whereas Tiger Parent’s fiscal year ends on
January 31. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations have been prepared utilizing period ends that
differ by less than 93 days, as permitted by Rule 11-02 Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of February 28,
2021 is presented as if the acquisition and issuance of SYNNEX common stock to the Tiger Parent stockholder had occurred on February 28, 2021 and
combines SYNNEX’ balance sheet as of February 28, 2021 with the Tiger Parent balance sheet as of January 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 combines the historical results from continuing operations of SYNNEX for the
year ended November 30, 2020 and the combined historical results of Tiger Parent predecessor and successor entities for the twelve months ended
January 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the three months ended February 28, 2021 combines
continuing operations for the three months ended February 28, 2021 for SYNNEX and the successor results of operations for the three months ended
January 31, 2021 for Tiger Parent.
Conforming accounting policies
Certain reclassifications have been made to Tiger Parent’s historical financial statements to conform to the presentation used in SYNNEX’ historical
financial information. Such reclassifications had no effect on Tiger Parent’s previously reported financial position or results of operations. The pro forma
financial data may not reflect all reclassifications necessary to conform Tiger Parent’s presentation to that of SYNNEX due to limitations on the
availability of information as of the date of this proxy statement. At completion of the Merger, SYNNEX will review Tiger Parent’s accounting policies. As
a result of that review, SYNNEX may identify differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a
material impact on the combined financial statements. At this time, SYNNEX is not aware of any differences that would have a material impact on the
combined financial statements, and therefore, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements assume there are no differences in
accounting policies.
Note 3. Estimated Purchase Price
The estimated purchase price allocation included with these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements is based upon an estimated purchase price using
the closing price of SYNNEX common stock on April 29, 2021. If the price of a share of SYNNEX common stock on the date the Merger is completed has
increased or decreased by 30% from the price assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the consideration
transferred would increase or decrease by approximately $1,649,340, which would be reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements as an increase or decrease to goodwill. The

It is assumed that all shares of SYNNEX common stock issued will be new issuances. However, SYNNEX may issue treasury shares for a portion of the
required shares of SYNNEX common stock.
Certain Tiger Holdings outstanding long-term cash incentive and awards of stock-based partnership units estimated to aggregate $69,000 will be settled
upon closing. At April 29, 2021, SYNNEX is unable to reasonably estimate the respective amounts attributable to pre- and post-Merger
services. Additionally, Tiger Holdings’ unvested stock-based partnership units awarded to Tiger Parent employees, with an estimated fair value
of approximately $117,000 with a remaining vesting period of up to two years will be converted into or redeemed for shares of SYNNEX stock with
equivalent vesting terms. The fair value attributable to post-Merger services will be recorded as compensation expense in SYNNEX’ post-Merger
financial statements. At this time, SYNNEX is unable to reasonably estimate the respective amounts attributable to pre- and post-Merger services. The
estimated 1,410 shares to be issued to the holders of such partnership units are included in the 44,000 shares above.
Note 4. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the Merger. The pro forma purchase price allocation below is based on preliminary
estimates of fair value as of April 29, 2021, using the historical balance sheet of Tiger Parent as of January 31, 2021. As of the date of this proxy, SYNNEX
has not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required estimates of the fair value of Tiger Parent’s assets to be acquired and
the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to acquired intangible assets is
based on preliminary fair value estimates and is subject to final management analysis, with the assistance of third-party valuation advisors, following the
completion of the Merger. The estimated intangible asset values and their useful lives could be affected by a variety of factors that may become known to
SYNNEX only upon access to additional information and/or changes in these factors that may occur prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. The
preliminary estimated intangible assets consist of customer relationships with an estimated weighted average useful life of fourteen years and indefinite
lived trade names. The estimated fair values of the intangibles were based on the purchase price allocation in the June 30, 2020 acquisition of Tiger Parent
by Apollo. Additional intangible asset classes may be identified as the valuation process continues.

Note 5. Pro Forma Adjustments
(A) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted as indicated below to record the issuance of SYNNEX term loans, net
of debt issuance costs, an increase in Tiger Parent equity prior to the completion of Merger and cash payments to the Tiger Parent stockholder. To
finance the Merger, repay certain indebtedness and for on-going operational requirements, SYNNEX has obtained financing commitments aggregating
$7,500,000. The commitments include a five-year credit facility comprising a term loan of $1,500,000 and an unsecured revolving line of credit facility of
$3,500,000. The remaining $2,500,000 of bridge financing commitments, which are syndicated to a number of financial institutions are expected to be
issued as unsecured notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet assumes that unsecured notes of $2,500,000 would be entered
into at, or near, the closing of the transaction with varying maturities, with an assumed weighted average interest rate of 2.69%, including estimated debt
issuance cost. Debt issuance cost related to the refinanced term loans of $1,500,000 and new revolving lines of credit facilities of $3,500,000 are estimated
to result in additional interest expense of approximately 14 basis points. As SYNNEX has used interest rate derivative contracts to economically convert
these variable-rate term loans to fixed-rate debt, there is no material impact on the combined interest cost. The write-off of deferred financing costs of
$3,030 related to these term loans has been recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet and has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in other income (expense), net in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of operations for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2020.

(C) Upon completion of the Merger, identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value, and these acquired assets could include assets
that are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best use. The fair value of identifiable
intangible assets is determined primarily using variations of the “income approach,” which is based on the present value of the future after-tax cash flows
attributable to each identifiable intangible asset. Other valuation methods, including the market approach and cost approach, are also considered in
estimating the fair value.
These preliminary estimates of fair value and weighted-average useful life may be different from the amounts included in the final acquisition accounting,
and the difference could have a material impact on the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. Once SYNNEX has full access to
information about Tiger Parent’s intangible assets, additional insight will be gained that could impact (i) the estimated total value assigned to identifiable
intangible assets and/or (ii) the estimated weighted-average useful life of each category of intangible assets. The estimated intangible asset values and
their useful lives could be impacted by a variety of factors that may become known to SYNNEX only upon access to additional information and/or by
changes in such factors that may occur prior to completion of the Merger. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory,
legislative, legal, technological and/or competitive environments. Increased knowledge about these and/or other elements could result in a change to the
estimated fair value of the identifiable Tiger Parent intangible assets and/or to the estimated weighted-average useful lives from what SYNNEX has
assumed in these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. The combined effect of any such changes could then also result in a significant increase or
decrease to SYNNEX’ estimate of associated amortization expense.
Included in Tiger Parent’s pro forma predecessor and successor combined statement of operations for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 used in
the combined unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 is amortization of intangible assets from the date of its
acquisition by Apollo. This adjustment is recorded to increase the amortization of intangible assets to reflect the full year impact of the Merger.
(D) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reclassify Tiger Parent’s deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded
in “other assets, net” and “other long-term liabilities” respectively in conformity with SYNNEX classification of “deferred tax assets” and “deferred tax
liabilities.” In addition, unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reclassify Tiger Parent’s receivables from vendors
recorded as an offset within “accounts payable” in conformity with SYNNEX classification of “receivables from vendors.”
 
112
Table of Contents
(E) Total estimated non-recurring acquisition-related transaction costs to be incurred by SYNNEX and Tiger Parent are approximately $42,000 to complete
the Merger. These costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with regulatory filings and Merger activities. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 has been adjusted to record estimated non-recurring costs of $42,000 in selling,
general and administrative expenses. To the extent, the estimated Tiger Parent costs are incurred prior to the closing of the Merger, these costs will not
form part of the combined retained earnings as Tiger Parent’s historical shareholders’ equity accounts will be eliminated upon acquisition (see Note 5G).
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of February 28, 2021 has been adjusted to record estimated acquisition-related costs of
$42,000 in other accrued liabilities. A corresponding tax benefit of $5,250 has been recorded in income taxes payable, with the net of tax impact presented
as a decrease to retained earnings.
(F) As of the completion of the Merger, SYNNEX will establish net deferred tax liabilities and make other tax adjustments as part of the accounting for the
Merger, primarily related to estimated fair value adjustments for identifiable intangible assets. Deferred taxes are recognized for the temporary difference
between assigned values in the purchase price allocation and the carryover tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The pro forma
adjustments to record the effect of deferred taxes was computed as follows:
 
Estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets to be acquired

(1)
SYNNEX assumed a 25% tax rate when estimating the deferred tax impacts of the acquisition, which is based on the applicable statutory rate as of
the assumed acquisition date and appropriately reflects certain SYNNEX and Tiger Parent bases differences that will not result in taxable or
deductible amounts in future years when the related financial reporting asset or liability will be recovered or settled.
(G) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to eliminate Tiger Parent’s historical shareholders’ equity accounts.
(H) Reflects elimination of management fee paid by Tiger Parent subsequent to its acquisition by Apollo. Such fees are not payable upon completion of
the Merger.
(I) The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been adjusted to record estimated additional interest expense related to the estimated
$2,500,000 of borrowings that will be used by SYNNEX to fund the Merger (see Note 5(A)). The weighted average interest rate on the notes expected to
be issued is assumed to be 2.69%, including debt issuance cost. In addition, debt issuance cost related to the refinanced term loans of $1,500,000 and new
revolving lines of credit facilities of $3,500,000 are estimated to result in additional interest expense of approximately 14 basis points.
SYNNEX estimates additional interest expense of $40,625 in the year ended November 30, 2020, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs
associated with the bridge financing expected to be issued to partially fund the Merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as
of February 28, 2021 has been
 
113

adjusted to reflect the net of tax ($10,156) impact as a decrease to retained earnings. SYNNEX also estimates a reduction in interest expense to eliminate
Tiger Parent’s historical interest costs.

A 1/8% variance in variable interest rate related to the term loan to finance the Merger would impact income from continuing operations by an increase or
decrease of $8,262 for the year ended November 30, 2020 and $2,000 for the three months ended February 28, 2021, respectively.
(J) The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been adjusted to reflect the aggregate pro forma income tax effect of the pro forma
adjustments above. SYNNEX assumed a blended tax rate of 25% for both the year ended November 30, 2020 and three months ended February 28, 2021,
when estimating the tax impact of the Merger, representing the federal statutory tax rate applicable to each period and exclusion of any state tax impacts
that are unknown as of the date of this proxy statement. Such unknown amounts are expected to be immaterial. The pro forma combined provision for
income taxes does not reflect the amounts that would have resulted had SYNNEX and Tiger Parent filed consolidated income tax returns during the
periods presented. The blended tax rates are estimates and do not take into account future income tax strategies that may be applied to the combined
entity. The effective tax rate of the combined company could be significantly different depending upon post-Merger activities of the combined company.
(K) Pro forma combined weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding for the year ended November 30, 2020 and three months ended
February 28, 2021 were calculated using the SYNNEX weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding at those dates together with the
44,000 shares of SYNNEX common stock assumed to be issued as partial consideration for the Merger, as follows:

Non-GAAP diluted pro forma combined EPS
In addition to disclosing basic and diluted pro forma combined EPS in accordance with Article 11, SYNNEX has also disclosed below non-GAAP diluted
pro forma combined EPS, which is diluted pro forma combined EPS excluding the per share, tax effected impact of (i) transaction-related and integration
expenses, (ii) amortization of intangible assets and (iii) share-based compensation. Management believes that providing this additional information is
useful to the reader to better assess and understand the combined entity’s base operating performance and for planning and forecasting in future
periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. Management also uses non-
GAAP EPS to establish operational goals and, in some cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. As non-GAAP diluted pro forma
combined EPS is not calculated in accordance with Article 11, it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other
companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measure and should be
used as a complement to, and in conjunction with data presented in accordance with GAAP.

(1) 
Diluted EPS is calculated using the two-class method. Unvested restricted stock awards granted to employees are considered participating
securities. For purposes of calculating Diluted EPS, pro forma combined income from continuing operations allocated to participating securities was
approximately 0.6% and 0.5% of pro forma combined income from continuing operations for the year ended November 30, 2020 and the three
months ended February 28, 2021, respectively.
(2) 
Included within the Tech Data pro forma combined Predecessor and Successor earnings for the year ended January 31, 2021 are $88.9 million of
purchase accounting adjustments primarily related to certain consideration received from vendors and $48.1 million of legal settlements and other
litigation related costs primarily related to an accrual for a legal matter in France and legal fees for various one-time matters. The purchase
accounting adjustments and legal settlements and other litigation related costs reduced diluted pro forma combined EPS, after tax, by approximately
$0.70 and $0.38, respectively. We consider these items to be non-recurring.
(3) 
The tax effect of taxable and deductible non-GAAP adjustments was calculated assuming a blended tax rate of 25% for both the year ended
November 30, 2020 and three months ended February 28, 2021.
(L) The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements do not present a combined dividend per share amount. SYNNEX currently pays a quarterly dividend
on shares of SYNNEX common stock and last paid a dividend on April 30, 2021 of $0.20 per share. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, during the
period prior to completion of the Merger, SYNNEX’ ability to issue dividends outside its normal practice or repurchase shares of common stock is limited.
The dividend policy of SYNNEX following completion of the Merger will be determined by the Board.
Note 6. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements assume that the Merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.

Overview
Tech Data Corporation is one of the world’s largest IT distribution and solutions companies. Tech Data serves a critical role in the center of the IT
ecosystem, bringing products from the world’s leading technology vendors to market, as well as helping customers create solutions best suited to
maximize business outcomes for their end-user customers. Tech Data’s customers include value-added resellers (which we refer to as “VARs”), direct
marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and managed service providers (which we refer to as “MSPs”) who support the diverse technology needs of end
users.
Tech Data was incorporated in 1974 to market data processing supplies to end users of mini and mainframe computers. With the advent of microcomputer
dealers, Tech Data made the transition to a wholesale technology distributor in 1983 by broadening its product line to include personal computer
products and withdrawing entirely from end-user sales.
Vendors and Customers
Tech Data’s value proposition to its vendors:
 
 
•
 Access to highly fragmented markets. Tech Data provides its vendors access to large and highly fragmented markets such as the small- and
medium-sized business (which we refer to as “SMB”) sector, which relies on VARs, its primary customer base, to gain access to and support
for new technology.
 
 
•
 Variable-cost route to market. Tech Data serves as a variable, cost effective route to market for its vendors by providing them with access to
resellers throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
 
 
•
 Logistics management. Tech Data’s world class logistics capabilities enable it to efficiently bring technology products to market through
one of its 24 strategically located logistics centers, by direct shipment from vendors to customers, or virtually through the Tech Data cloud
marketplace.
 
 
•
 Services. Tech Data provides a comprehensive portfolio of services to its vendors, including integration services, supply chain management
services, and field, depot and support services, such as field engineering, equipment installation, maintenance, repair and many others.
Tech Data distributes and markets hundreds of thousands of products from approximately 1,000 of the world’s leading technology hardware
manufacturers and software publishers, as well as suppliers of next-generation technologies and delivery models such as converged and hyper-
converged infrastructure, the cloud, security, analytics/Internet of things (which we refer to as “IoT”), and services. These products are typically
purchased directly from the vendor on a non-exclusive basis. Conversely, Tech Data’s vendor agreements do not restrict Tech Data from selling similar
products manufactured by competitors, nor do they require Tech Data to sell a specified quantity of product. As a result, Tech Data has the flexibility to
terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change, pricing considerations, product availability, and customer
demand or vendor distribution policies. Overall, Tech Data believes that its diversified and evolving product and solutions portfolio provides a solid
platform for continued growth.
Tech Data’s value proposition to its customers:
 
 
•
 End-to-end solutions. Tech Data helps its customers create comprehensive, multi-vendor solutions from the world’s leading technology
vendors to maximize business outcomes for their end-user customers.
 
 
•
 Logistics management. Tech Data’s robust order and logistics management systems enable it to fulfill customer orders quickly and
efficiently through one of its 24 strategically located logistics centers, by direct shipment from the vendor, or virtually through the Tech
Data cloud marketplace.
 
117Table of Contents
 
•
 Financing and inventory management. Tech Data provides its customers with access to flexible financing programs and inventory
management for the technology products, services and solutions they acquire.
 
 
•
 Training and technical support. Tech Data provides its reseller customers a high level of training and technical support.
 
 
•
 Services. Tech Data provides its customers with complete customer management solutions, including customer acquisition, enablement and
revenue-growth services, such as contract renewals and software license compliance, as well as product configuration/integration services.
In addition, Tech Data provides its resellers access to a number of special promotions and marketing services on behalf of its vendors.
Tech Data serves one of the largest bases of resellers throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Tech Data’s products are purchased directly
from vendors in significant quantities and are marketed to an active reseller base of over 125,000 VARs, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and
MSPs. Tech Data’s VAR customers, in many cases, rely on Tech Data as their principal source of technology products and the related financing for the
products. VARs typically prefer not to invest the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships with vendors or stock
significant product inventories. Direct marketers, retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with vendors for their highest volume
products, but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and an alternative source for products acquired directly. Tech
Data’s customers rely on its expertise and resources to gain vital insights into emerging technologies and to help them capture growth opportunities in a
rapidly changing technology landscape. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of Tech Data’s net sales during the period from July 1, 2020 to
January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019.
Products and Services
Tech Data groups its offerings into two primary solutions portfolios:
 
 
•
 Endpoint Solutions Portfolio: This primarily includes PC systems, mobile phones and accessories, printers, peripherals, supplies, endpoint
technology software and consumer electronics.
 
 
•
 Advanced Solutions Portfolio: This primarily includes data center technologies such as storage, networking, servers, advanced technology
software and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. The Advanced Solutions portfolio also includes Tech Data’s specialized
solution businesses.
Employees
On January 31, 2021, Tech Data had over 14,000 employees (as measured on a full-time equivalent basis) in more than forty countries on five continents.

Overview
On November 12, 2019, Tech Data Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as subsequently amended on November 27, 2019 (the
“Merger Agreement”), with Tiger Midco, LLC (“Tiger Midco”) and Tiger Merger Sub Co. (“Merger Sub”). Tiger Midco and Merger Sub are affiliates of
certain funds (the “Apollo Funds”), managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management Inc. (“Apollo”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Tiger Midco
agreed to acquire all the outstanding shares of Tech Data Corporation’s common stock (other than shares held by Tech Data Corporation as treasury
stock or held by certain affiliates of the Apollo Funds) for $145 per share in cash. On June 30, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into Tech Data
Corporation (the “Merger”), with Tech Data Corporation surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiger Midco (see Note 4 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries including Tiger
Midco, is the parent company of Tech Data Corporation subsequent to the Merger. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $5.2 billion. Tiger
Parent Holdings, L.P. (the “Parent”), the parent company of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, contributed approximately $3.7 billion as equity to Tiger Parent
(AP) Corporation in conjunction with the Merger, of which approximately $3.6 billion was used to fund the purchase price for Tech Data Corporation. The
remaining purchase price for Tech Data Corporation was financed through the issuance of debt (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion) and cash on hand at Tech Data Corporation.
The consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 include the consolidated results of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation from
the date of the Merger through January 31, 2021 (the “successor period”) and the consolidated results of Tech Data Corporation for periods prior to the
Merger on June 30, 2020 (the “predecessor period”). References to “we”, “our”, “us” or the “Company” indicate Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation and its
subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the date of the Merger and Tech Data Corporation and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger.
We are one of the world’s largest IT distribution and solutions companies. We serve a critical role in the center of the IT ecosystem, bringing products
from the world’s leading technology vendors to market, as well as helping our customers create solutions best suited to maximize business outcomes for
their end-user customers. We

distribute and market products from many of the world’s leading technology hardware manufacturers and software publishers, as well as suppliers of
next-generation technologies and delivery models such as converged and hyperconverged infrastructure, the cloud, security, analytics/Internet of things
(“IoT”) and services. Our customers include value-added resellers, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and managed service providers who
support the diverse technology needs of end users.
On November 25, 2019, we completed the acquisition of DLT Solutions (“DLT”), a premier software and cloud solutions aggregator focused on the U.S.
public sector. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of DLT for a purchase price of approximately $209 million in cash. The DLT acquisition enables us
to proactively develop opportunities, accelerate growth and simplify complexity for our channel partners that are serving the U.S. public sector space.
Furthermore, on September 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Innovix Distribution (“Innovix”), a leading technology distributor in the Asia-Pacific
region, for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $52 million in cash. The Innovix acquisition expands our presence across the Asia-
Pacific region and strengthens our Endpoint Solutions and Advanced Solutions capabilities.
Planned SYNNEX Merger
On March 22, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “SYNNEX Merger Agreement”) with SYNNEX Corporation (“SYNNEX”) and
its affiliates. Pursuant to the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions described therein, the affiliates of SYNNEX
will acquire all the outstanding shares of our common stock (the “SYNNEX Merger”).
At the effective time of the SYNNEX Merger, except as otherwise set forth in the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, all our issued and outstanding common
shares will be converted automatically into and thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) $1,610,000,000 in cash, in the aggregate and (ii) 44,000,000
total shares of common stock of SYNNEX. Prior to the effective date of the SYNNEX Merger, affiliates of Apollo are required to make an additional equity
contribution of at least $500 million in cash to the Company. The completion of the SYNNEX Merger is also subject to customary closing conditions,
including the adoption of the SYNNEX Merger Agreement by a majority of the holders of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, the
expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, certain foreign regulatory
approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The global impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility, impacting
customer demand and impeding global supply chains. In response to COVID-19, the company continues to operate with a significant portion of our
global workforce participating in work-from-home arrangements and all of our logistics centers are open and functioning with strict health and safety
guidelines in place. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our operations and financial condition, including
due to uncertainties relating to the severity and duration of the pandemic, the effect on our customers and customer demand and the length of the
restrictions and closures imposed by various governments. Accordingly, the operating results and financial condition discussed herein may not be
indicative of future operating results and trends.

In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”), the
Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information. Certain
 
120Table of Contents
Table of Contents
of these measures are presented as adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as “impact of changes in foreign currencies”).
Removing the impact of the changes in foreign currencies provides a framework for assessing our financial performance as compared to prior periods.
The impact of changes in foreign currencies is calculated by using the exchange rates from the prior year comparable period applied to the results of
operations for the current period. The measure of adjusted EBITDA is based on a defined term in our Asset Based Credit Agreement. The non-GAAP
financial measures presented in this document include:
 
 
•
 Net sales, as adjusted, which is defined as net sales adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies;
 
 
•
 Gross profit, as adjusted, which is defined as gross profit as adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies;
 
 
•
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”), as adjusted, which is defined as SG&A as adjusted for the impact of changes in
foreign currencies;
 
 
•
 Reported EBITDA, which is defined as net income adjusted for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and
other expense, net;
 
 
•
 Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as reported EBITDA plus or minus adjustments for defined items in our Asset Based Credit Agreement,
including, but not limited to, extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual items, acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, human
resources expenses, stock-based and long term incentive compensation expense, legal settlements and other litigation related costs,
discontinued operations/facilities, systems design, implementation or establishment costs, public company costs, purchase accounting
adjustments and management fees.
Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to assess and understand our financial performance as compared
with results from previous periods. However, analysis of results via these financial measures should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with,
data presented in accordance with GAAP. Reported EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not include, among other things, cash requirements for capital
expenditures and working capital, or interest expense in relation to debt facilities. Therefore, reported EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may have certain
limitations in analyzing our financial results. Additionally, because these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Americas
 
 
•
 The decrease in Americas net sales, as adjusted, of approximately $630 million is primarily due to a decrease in both our Endpoint Solutions
and Advanced Solutions portfolios, including the impact of COVID-19 on customer demand, coupled with portfolio optimization actions.
The decrease in Americas net sales is partially offset by the impact of a full year of DLT operations due to the acquisition of DLT in
November 2019.
Europe
 
 
•
 The decrease in Europe net sales, as adjusted, of approximately $529 million is primarily due to a decrease in our Advanced Solutions
portfolio, including the impact of COVID-19 on customer demand, coupled with portfolio optimization actions in our Endpoint Solutions
portfolio. The impact of changes in foreign currencies is primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.

$76 million for purchase accounting adjustments related to certain consideration received from vendors, partially offset by the impact of the DLT and
Innovix acquisitions. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, as reported, is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of purchase
accounting adjustments.

investments in our strategic priorities and a benefit in the prior year of approximately $25 million related to the collection of an accounts receivable

SYNNEX CORP_20210609_DEFM14A_19338736_4236234.Pdf,"Acquisition, Integration and Restructuring Expenses","Acquisition, Integration and Restructuring Expenses
Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of costs related to the Merger, the new Global Optimization Program initiated
in fiscal 2021 (the “GBO 2 Program”), the prior Global Business Optimization Program which was initiated in fiscal 2019 (the “GBO Program”), the tdONE
Program and the fiscal 2018 acquisition of Avnet, Inc.’s (“Avnet”) Technology Solutions business (“TS”).
The Merger
We incurred transaction costs related to the completion of the Merger, including professional services costs, stock-based compensation expense and
personnel and other costs. Professional services costs are primarily comprised of investment banking fees, legal expenses, and tax and other consulting
services. Stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to charges associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and
performance based restricted stock units pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Personnel and other costs are primarily comprised of severance
costs including amounts due to employees pursuant to the Company’s Change in Control Severance Policy, as well as retention costs.
Additionally, we recorded approximately $37 million of professional services costs during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 related to
services associated with start-up activities, specifically organization costs, as well as transaction costs related to the Merger, directed by Tiger Midco on
behalf of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation. The nature of these services included legal services, investment banking services and tax and other consulting
services.

GBO 2 Program
In conjunction with the completion of the Merger, in fiscal 2021 we began our GBO 2 Program. The GBO 2 Program includes investments that will optimize
and standardize processes and apply data and analytics to be more agile in a rapidly evolving environment, increasing productivity, profitability and
optimizing net-working capital. Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses related to the GBO 2 Program are primarily comprised of restructuring
costs and other professional services costs. Restructuring costs are comprised of severance costs and other associated exit costs, including certain
consulting costs. Other professional services costs are primarily comprised of professional services fees not related to restructuring activities, including
costs related to improving profitability and optimizing net-working capital. Our preliminary estimate of acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses
under the GBO 2 program is $175 million to $200 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred through fiscal 2023.

tdONE Program
In fiscal 2021, we began the tdONE Program to simplify, standardize and synchronize the Company’s processes and systems in support of our global
transformation initiative. Acquisition and integration costs related to the tdONE program include $13.1 million in professional services and $1.0 million in
personnel and other costs for the period of July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. There were no tdONE costs incurred in the predecessor period.
Acquisition of TS
On February 27, 2017, we acquired all the outstanding shares of TS for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion, comprised of
approximately $2.5 billion in cash and 2,785,402 shares of our common stock.
Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition of TS are primarily comprised of restructuring costs, IT related costs,
professional services, transaction related costs and other costs. Restructuring costs are comprised of severance and facility exit costs. IT related costs
consist primarily of data center and non-ERP application migration and integration costs, as well as, IT related professional services. Professional
services are primarily comprised of integration related activities, including professional fees for project management, accounting, tax and other consulting
services. Transaction related costs primarily consist of investment banking fees, legal expenses and due diligence costs incurred in connection with the
completion of the transaction. Other costs includes payroll related costs including retention, stock compensation, relocation and travel expenses incurred
as part of the integration of TS. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, other costs are partially offset by a gain of $9.6 million related to the final
working capital adjustment for the acquisition of TS as part of a settlement agreement with Avnet.
We incurred no acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition of TS during the years ended January 31, 2021 or January 31,
2020 and do not expect to incur any additional costs in future periods. Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses for fiscal 2019 related to the
acquisition of TS are comprised of the following:

Legal Settlements and Other Litigation, Net
During the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, the Company recorded a charge of $41.2 million in “legal settlements and other litigation, net” in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to a legal matter in France (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion).
We have also been a claimant in proceedings seeking damages primarily from certain manufacturers of LCD flat panel and cathode ray tube displays, as
well as reimbursement from insurance providers of certain costs associated with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and other
financial information from fiscal 2009 to 2013. We have reached settlement agreements during the periods presented and have recorded these amounts net
of attorney fees and other expenses, in “legal settlements and other litigation, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Gain on Bargain Purchase
On September 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Innovix for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $52 million. We have
accounted for the acquisition as a business combination and allocated the preliminary estimated purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the estimated fair values of the net tangible assets over the preliminary estimated purchase price was
recorded as a gain on bargain purchase of $30.2 million on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
Gain On Sale Of Fixed Assets
Sale-leaseback Transactions
During fiscal 2021 we executed sale-leaseback transactions for an office facility and five logistics facilities that we previously owned throughout the
United States, resulting in net cash proceeds of $272.7 million. These transactions qualified as sales for accounting purposes and resulted in a net gain of
$20.1 million which is included in “gain on sale of fixed assets” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to
January 31, 2021.
Sale of Facility
During fiscal 2021, we sold one of our logistics facilities located in the United States for net cash proceeds of $42.2 million. We recorded a loss of
$4.6 million in “gain on sale of fixed assets” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
Goodwill Impairment
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded goodwill impairment expense of $47.4 million related to our Asia-Pacific reporting unit (see Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).
Gain On Disposal Of Subsidiary
During fiscal 2019, we executed an agreement to sell certain of our operations in Ireland for a total sales price of approximately $15.3 million. We recorded
a gain on sale of $6.7 million during the year ended January 31, 2019, which included the reclassification of $5.1 million from accumulated other
comprehensive income for cumulative translation adjustments associated with our investment in this foreign entity. We recorded an additional gain on
the sale of this entity of $1.4 million during the year ended January 31, 2020. The operating results of this entity during the year ended January 31, 2019
were insignificant relative to the consolidated financial results.

Adjusted EBITDA is based on a defined term in our Asset Based Credit Agreement. Management believes that providing this additional information is
useful to the reader to assess and understand our financial performance as compared with results from previous periods. However, analysis of results via
this financial measure should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not
include, among other things, cash requirements for capital expenditures and working capital, or interest expense in relation to our debt facilities.
Therefore, adjusted EBITDA may have certain limitations in analyzing our financial results. Additionally, because this measure is not calculated in
accordance with GAAP, it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

•
 The decrease in reported EBITDA is primarily due to an increase in acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses primarily due to
transaction costs related to the Merger, a decrease in net sales volume, purchase accounting adjustments related to certain consideration
received from vendors and a charge of $41 million related to a legal matter in France. These items are partially offset by a gain on bargain
purchase related to the acquisition of Innovix, lower travel and payroll costs, the impact of the acquisition of DLT and a net gain on the sale
of certain fixed assets.

 The decrease in reported EBITDA is primarily due to a charge of $41 million related to a legal matter in France, purchase accounting
adjustments related to certain consideration received from vendors and an increase in acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses,
partially offset by the favorable impact of the mix of products sold and lower SG&A costs.

Asia-Pacific Commentary    
2021 - 2020    
 
 
•
 The increase in reported EBITDA is primarily due to a gain on bargain purchase related to the acquisition of Innovix, partially offset by an
increase in acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses.
 
 
•
 The decrease in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to a decrease in organic net sales volume, partially offset by lower payroll costs and the
impact of the acquisition of Innovix.
2020 - 2019
 
 
•
 The increase in reported EBITDA is primarily due to a $47.4 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year 2019 and an increase in net
sales volume, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.
 
 
•
 The slight increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to an increase in net sales volume, partially offset by an increase in SG&A

The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 of $35.4 million is primarily due to borrowings under the Asset Based Credit
Agreement in conjunction with the Merger (see Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information).
The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 of $20.7 million is primarily due to a benefit of $10.2 million related to our net
investment hedges (see further discussion in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and lower interest rates and average balances
outstanding on term loan credit agreements.

Other expense, net, consists primarily of discounts on the sale of accounts receivable, net foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain
financing transactions and the related derivative instruments used to hedge such financing transactions, gains and losses on the investments contained
within life insurance policies used to fund our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and interest income.
The change in other expense, net, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to reduced gains in the fair value of the investments
contained within life insurance policies and lower interest income, partially offset by lower discount fees on the sale of accounts receivable.
The change in other expense, net, during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to higher gains on the investments contained within
life insurance policies, partially offset by lower interest income and higher discount fees on the sale of accounts receivable. The gains on investments are
substantially offset in our payroll costs which are reflected in SG&A as part of operating income.",150,150

2021 - 2020 Commentary
The change in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the following:
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2021, a charge of $41.2 million related to a legal matter in France was not deductible for income tax purposes.
 
140Table of Contents
 
•
 In fiscal 2021, a portion of the transaction costs related to the Merger was not deductible for income tax purposes.
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2021, we recorded $8.2 million of income tax expense related to the settlement of the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $8.1 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities in the United Kingdom
due to a change in the statutory income tax rate.
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2021, we paid foreign withholding taxes of $5.7 million.
These items were partially offset by the favorable impact of the following:
 
 
•
 The carryback of the fiscal 2021 net operating loss in the United States to tax years with a higher statutory income tax rate.
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2021, we recorded a $30.2 million bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of Innovix which was not taxable.
The change in the effective tax rate was also impacted by the relative mix of earnings and losses within the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The
decrease in the absolute dollar value of the provision for income taxes as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in taxable earnings, as
well as the net impact of the aforementioned items.
2020 - 2019 Commentary
The increase in both the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the impact of the
following:
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2019, we finalized our analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased our estimate of the one-time
transition tax by $49.2 million.
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $13.0 million in relation to a settlement agreement reached with Avnet.
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $9.6 million due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters related to TS.
 
 
•
 In fiscal 2019, we recorded income tax benefits of $6.0 million related to changes in deferred tax valuation allowances.
Additionally, the increase in the absolute dollar value of the provision for income taxes as compared to the prior year is due to an increase in taxable
earnings. The change in the effective tax rate was also impacted by goodwill impairment expense in fiscal 2019 which was not deductible for tax purposes
and the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate.
U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (which we refer to as “U.S. Tax Reform”) which significantly
revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a
modified territorial tax system that included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The SEC provided
accounting and reporting guidance that allowed us to report provisional amounts within a measurement period up to one year due to the complexities
inherent in adopting the changes. Accordingly, in fiscal 2018, we recorded our provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.
During fiscal 2019, we finalized our analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased our estimate of the one-time transition tax by
$49.2 million, primarily due to further analysis of earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries and the utilization of foreign tax credits.

Tax Indemnifications
In connection with the acquisition of TS, pursuant to the interest purchase agreement, the Company and Avnet agreed to indemnify each other in relation
to certain tax matters. As a result, we have recorded certain indemnification assets and liabilities for expected amounts to be received from and paid to
Avnet. During the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters and the expiration of certain
statutes of limitation, we recorded benefits in income tax expense of
$0.6 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively. As a result, we recorded expenses of $0.6 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million during the years
ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in “selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations, related to changes in the corresponding indemnification assets and liabilities recorded. The net impact of these items had no impact on our
net income.

Cash Conversion Cycle
 
 
LOGO
  
As a distribution company, our business requires significant investment in working capital,
particularly accounts receivable and inventory, partially financed through our accounts payable
to vendors. An important driver of our operating cash flows is our cash conversion cycle (also
referred to as “net cash days”). Our net cash days are defined as days of sales outstanding in
accounts receivable plus days of supply on hand in inventory, less days of purchases
outstanding in accounts payable. The following tables present the components of our cash
conversion cycle, in days, as of January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Operating Activities
The increase in cash resulting from operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in
working capital, including the timing of payments to vendors and the impact of lower inventory balances, partially offset by lower net income.
The increase in cash resulting from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in
working capital and higher earnings.

Capital Resources And Debt Compliance
As part of our capital structure and to provide us with significant liquidity, we have a diverse range of financing facilities across our geographic regions
with various financial institutions. Also providing us liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balances across our regions which are deposited and/or
invested with various financial institutions. We are exposed to risk of loss on funds deposited with these financial institutions; however, we monitor our
financing and depository financial institution partners regularly for credit quality. Our liquidity is subject to many factors, including the potential impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets; however, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including our financing facilities, trade credit
from vendors, cash resources, as well as cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and
cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
We currently have sufficient resources, cash flows and liquidity within the U.S. to fund current and expected future working capital requirements.
However, during the year we were able to repatriate foreign cash, along with the majority of our remaining foreign earnings which have been previously
taxed, with minimal additional tax consequences. We plan to continue reinvesting future foreign earnings indefinitely outside the U.S. Any future
remittances of foreign cash could be subject to additional foreign withholding tax, U.S. state taxes and certain tax impacts relating to foreign currency
exchange effects.

Accounts receivable purchase agreements
We have uncommitted accounts receivable purchase agreements under which certain accounts receivable may be sold, without recourse, to third-party
financial institutions. Under these programs, we may sell certain accounts receivable in exchange for cash less a discount, as defined in the agreements.
Available capacity under these programs, which we use as a source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible
to be sold into these programs and the financial institutions’ willingness to purchase such receivables, which may be impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. In addition, certain of these agreements also require that we continue to service, administer and collect the sold accounts receivable. At
January 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a total of $691.9 million and $739.2 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold to and held by financial institutions
under these agreements. During the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years
ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, discount fees recorded under these facilities were $5.6 million, $4.4 million, $15.9 million and $14.9 million, respectively,
which are included as a component of “other expense, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Share Repurchase Program
In October 2018, Tech Data’s Board of Directors (which we refer to as “Tech Data Board”) authorized a share repurchase program for up to $200.0 million
of our common stock. In February 2019, Tech Data Board approved a $100.0 million increase to the program. In August 2019, Tech Data Board authorized
the repurchase of up to an additional $200.0 million of our common stock, resulting in a total share repurchase authorization of $500.0 million. In
conjunction with our share repurchase program, a 10b5-1 plan was executed that instructed the broker selected by the Company to repurchase shares on
our behalf. The amount of common stock repurchased in accordance with the 10b5-1 plan on any given trading day was determined by a formula in the
plan, which was based on the market price of our common stock. Shares we repurchased were held in treasury for general corporate purposes, including
issuances under equity incentive and benefit plans.
We repurchased 1,723,081 shares of our common stock at a cost of $170.2 million during the year ended January 31, 2020 and 1,429,154 shares of our
common stock at a cost of $107.0 million during the year ended January 31, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement with the affiliates of
Apollo Funds, we suspended our share repurchase program as of November 13, 2019.

Guarantees
As is customary in the technology industry, to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us, we have arrangements with certain finance
companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers. In conjunction with certain of these arrangements, we have agreements with the
finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory, which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies. Due
to various reasons, including among other items, the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with
the customer at any point in time, our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated. Repurchases of inventory by us
under these arrangements have been insignificant to date.

If a stockholder wishes to present a proposal to be included in our Proxy Statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the proponent and the
proposal must comply with the proxy proposal submission rules of the SEC. One of the requirements is that the proposal be received by the Corporate
Secretary no later than October 13, 2021. Proposals we receive after that date will not be included in the Proxy Statement. We urge stockholders to submit
proposals by Certified Mail—Return Receipt Requested.
A stockholder proposal not included in our proxy statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be ineligible for presentation at the 2022
Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless the stockholder gives timely notice of the proposal in writing to the Corporate Secretary of SYNNEX at the
principal executive offices of SYNNEX. Under our Bylaws, in order for a matter to be deemed properly presented by a stockholder, timely notice must be
delivered to, or mailed and received by, us not less than 50 nor more than 75 days prior to the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders; provided, however,
that in the event that less than 65 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders is given or made to
stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the earlier of (a) the close of business on the 15th day following
the day on which such notice of the date of the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first
occurs, and (b) two (2) days prior to the date of the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The stockholder’s notice must set forth, as to each proposed matter, the following: (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
meeting and reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; (b) the name and address, as they appear on our books, of the stockholder proposing
such business; (c) the class and number of shares of our securities that are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (d) any material interest of the
stockholder in such business; and (e) any other information that is required to be provided by such stockholder pursuant to proxy proposal submission
rules of the SEC. The presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge any matter not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.
In addition, our Bylaws contain provisions that address the process by which a stockholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board
at an Annual Meeting. In order to nominate a candidate for director, a stockholder must give timely notice in writing to our Corporate Secretary and
otherwise comply with the provisions of our Bylaws. To be timely, our Bylaws provide that we must have received the stockholder’s notice not less than
120 days prior to the scheduled date of such meeting. However, if notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the Annual Meeting is given or made to
stockholders less than 100 days prior to the meeting date, we must receive the stockholder’s notice by the close of business on the 7th day after the
earlier of the day we mailed notice of the Annual Meeting date or provided such public disclosure of the meeting date. Information required by our
Bylaws to be in the notice include the name and contact information for the candidate and the person making the nomination and other information about
the nominee that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules and regulations

To the Shareholder and the Board of Directors of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation and subsidiaries, which comprise the
consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2021 (Successor) and January 31, 2020 (Predecessor), and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the periods from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 (Successor) and February 1,
2020 to June 30, 2020 (Predecessor), the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 (Predecessor), and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tiger Parent (AP)
Corporation and subsidiaries at January 31, 2021 (Successor) and January 31, 2020 (Predecessor), and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for the periods from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 (Successor) and February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 (Predecessor), and the fiscal years
ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 (Predecessor) in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

TIGER PARENT (AP) CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — Business And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
On November 12, 2019, Tech Data Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as subsequently amended on November 27, 2019 (the
‘‘Merger Agreement’’), with Tiger Midco, LLC (“Tiger Midco”) and Tiger Merger Sub Co. (“Merger Sub”). Tiger Midco and Merger Sub are affiliates of
certain funds (the “Apollo Funds”), managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management Inc. (“Apollo”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Tiger Midco
agreed to acquire all the outstanding shares of Tech Data Corporation’s common stock (other than shares held by Tech Data Corporation as treasury
stock or held by certain affiliates of the Apollo Funds) for $145 per share in cash. On June 30, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into Tech Data
Corporation (the “Merger”), with Tech Data Corporation surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiger Midco (see Note 4 –
Acquisitions for additional information).
Tiger Parent, LLC was formed on November 6, 2019 and was converted to Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation in June 2020. Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries including Tiger Midco, is the parent company of Tech Data Corporation subsequent to the Merger. The
consolidated financial statements include the consolidated results of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation from the date of the Merger through January 31, 2021
(the “successor period”) and the consolidated results of Tech Data Corporation for periods prior to the Merger on June 30, 2020 (the “predecessor
period”). References to the “Company” indicate Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation and its subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the date of the Merger and
Tech Data Corporation and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger.
The Company is one of the world’s largest IT distribution and solutions companies. The Company serves a critical role in the center of the IT ecosystem,
bringing products from the world’s leading technology vendors to market, as well as helping customers create solutions best suited to maximize business
outcomes for their end-user customers. The Company’s customers include value-added resellers, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and
managed service providers who support the diverse technology needs of end users. The Company manages its business in three geographic regions; the
Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation and its subsidiaries during the successor period and Tech
Data Corporation and its subsidiaries during the predecessor period. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The Company operates on a fiscal year that ends on January 31.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.
(“GAAP”). These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Merger is being accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting. As a result of the application of purchase
accounting, the consolidated financial statements for the successor period are not comparable to those of the predecessor period.

Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenues primarily result from the sale of various technology products and services. The Company recognizes revenue as control of
products is transferred to customers, which generally happens at the point of shipment. Products sold by the Company are delivered via shipment from
the Company’s facilities, drop-shipment directly from the vendor, or by electronic delivery of keys for software products. In relation to product support,
supply chain management and other services performed by the Company, revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Service revenues
and related contract liabilities were not material for the periods presented.
The Company has contracts with certain customers where the Company’s performance obligation is to arrange for the products or services to be
provided by another party. In these arrangements, as the Company assumes an agency relationship in the transaction, revenue is recognized in the
amount of the net fee associated with serving as an agent. These arrangements primarily relate to certain fulfillment contracts, as well as sales of software
services and extended warranty services.
The Company allows its customers to exchange product or return for credit subject to certain limitations. A liability is recorded at the time of sale for
estimated product returns based upon historical experience and an asset is recognized for the amount expected to be recorded in inventory upon product
return. The Company also provides volume rebates and other discounts to certain customers which are considered variable consideration. A provision
for customer rebates and other discounts is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale based on an evaluation of the contract terms and
historical experience.
The Company considers shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill the sales of products. Shipping revenue is included in net sales when control
of the product is transferred to the customer, and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold. Taxes imposed by
governmental authorities on the Company’s revenue producing activities with customers, such as sales taxes and value added taxes, are excluded from
net sales.
The Company disaggregates its revenue by geography, which the Company believes provides a meaningful depiction of the nature of its revenue. Net
sales includes service revenues, which are not a significant component of total revenue and are aggregated within the respective geographies. The
following table sets forth the Company’s disaggregated net sales (in thousands):

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Short-term investments which are highly liquid and have an original maturity of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.
Investments
Prior to the Merger, the Company invested in life insurance policies to fund the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The life insurance
asset recorded by the Company was the amount that would be realized upon the assumed surrender of the policy. This amount was based on the
underlying fair value of the invested assets contained within the life insurance policies. The gains and losses were recorded in the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Operations within “other expense, net.”
Accounts Receivable
The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable for future expected credit losses resulting from the inability or
unwillingness of its customers to make required payments. In estimating the required allowance, the Company takes into consideration historical credit
losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current
conditions as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates or gross domestic product growth.
Expected credit losses are estimated on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist using an age-based reserve model. Receivables that do not
share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis.

“Other” primarily includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currencies.
The Company has uncommitted accounts receivable purchase agreements under which certain accounts receivable may be sold, without recourse, to
third-party financial institutions. Under these programs, the Company may sell certain accounts receivable in exchange for cash less a discount, as
defined in the agreements. Available capacity under these programs, which the Company uses as a source of working capital funding, is dependent on
the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold into these programs and the financial institutions’ willingness to purchase such receivables. In
addition, certain of these agreements also require that the Company continue to service, administer and collect the sold accounts receivable. At
January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a total of $691.9 million and $739.2 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold to and held by financial
institutions under these agreements. Discount fees recorded under these facilities, which are included as a component of “other expense, net” in the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations, were $5.6 million, $4.4 million, $15.9 million and $14.9 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to
January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Table of Contents
Inventories
Inventories, consisting entirely of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a moving average cost
basis. Inventory is written down for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value, based
upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks (such as technological obsolescence and the nature of
vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns), foreign currency fluctuations for foreign-sourced products and assumptions about
future demand.
Vendor Programs
The Company participates in various vendor programs under which the vendor may provide certain incentives such as cooperative advertising
allowances, infrastructure funding, more favorable payment terms, early pay discounts and rebate arrangements. These programs are generally under
quarterly, semi-annual or annual agreements with the vendors; however, some of these programs are negotiated on an ad-hoc basis mutually developed
with the vendor. Volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded when they are earned as a reduction of inventory and
as a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold. Vendor incentives for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and
infrastructure funding are recorded when earned as adjustments to cost of products sold or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on
the nature of the program.
Allowances for credit losses on receivables related to vendor programs are recorded for estimated losses resulting from vendors’ inability to pay,
rejections of claims by vendors and other risk characteristics including historical credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable
forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current conditions as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic
conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates or gross domestic product growth.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense includes depreciation of purchased property and equipment. Depreciation expense is
computed over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or lease periods using the straight-line method, generally as follows:
 
 
  
Years
Buildings and improvements
  
15 - 39
Leasehold improvements
  
3 - 10
Furniture, fixtures and equipment
  
3 - 10
Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred. When assets are sold or retired, the cost of the asset and the related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any gain or loss is recognized at such time. The Company also examines the carrying value of its property
and equipment for potential impairment as current events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
Intangible Assets, net
Included within “intangible assets, net,” at January 31, 2021 are capitalized software and development costs, as well as customer relationships. Such
capitalized costs and intangible assets are being amortized over a period of three years to fifteen years. The Company examines the carrying value of its
intangible assets with finite lives, for potential impairment as current events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recoverable. Additionally, included within intangible assets are the Company’s trade name intangibles. Trade name intangible assets are indefinite lived
intangible assets that are tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not
that the asset is impaired.
 
162
Table of Contents
Prior to the Merger, “intangible assets, net” included capitalized software and development costs, as well as customer and vendor relationships, trade
names and other intangible assets acquired in connection with various business acquisitions. These capitalized costs and intangible assets were being
amortized over a period of three years to fifteen years.
The Company’s capitalized software has been obtained or developed for internal use only. Development and acquisition costs are capitalized for
computer software only when management authorizes and commits to funding a computer software project through the approval of a capital expenditure
requisition, and the software project is either for the development of new software, to increase the life of existing software or to add significantly to the
functionality of existing software. Once these requirements have been met, capitalization would begin at the point that conceptual formulation,
evaluation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed. Capitalization ceases when the software project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The Company’s accounting policy is to amortize capitalized software costs on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from three years to ten years, depending upon the nature of the software, the stability of the hardware platform on which the
software is installed, its fit in the Company’s overall strategy and the Company’s experience with similar software.
Prepaid maintenance fees associated with a software application are accounted for separately from the related software and amortized over the life of the
maintenance agreement. General, administrative, overhead, training, non-development data conversion processes, and maintenance costs, as well as the
costs associated with the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
The Company performs an annual review for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill, or more frequently if current events and
circumstances indicate a possible impairment. For purposes of its goodwill analysis, the Company has three reporting units based on its geographic
regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The Company evaluates the appropriateness of performing a qualitative assessment, on a reporting unit
level, based on current circumstances. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will not be performed. The factors that are considered in the qualitative analysis
include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors such as increases in product cost, labor, or other costs that would
have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows and other relevant entity-specific events and information.
If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative
impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test compares the fair values of the Company’s reporting units with their carrying amounts,
including goodwill. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. The assumptions used in the
market approach are based on the value of a business through an analysis of multiples of guideline companies and recent sales or offerings of a
comparable entity. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach are based on historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, working
capital requirements, economic conditions and other relevant factors. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment
charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, only to the extent of the carrying value of
goodwill allocated to that reporting unit (see Note 3 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further discussion).
Transactions with Related Parties
In connection with the Merger, the Company has entered into certain transactions with its parent, Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P. (the “Parent”) and certain
affiliates of Apollo, including a management fee agreement. Fees
 
163
Table of Contents
incurred under the management fee agreement were $4.8 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 and are included in “selling, general
and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, the Company incurred expenses for the period from July 1, 2020
to January 31, 2021 of approximately $50 million for transaction related services provided by certain affiliates of Apollo and $8.7 million for the
reimbursement of transaction costs incurred by certain affiliates of Apollo which are recorded in “acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses” in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations. At January 31, 2021, the Company had amounts payable to the Parent of $6.2 million primarily related to
transaction costs associated with the completion of the Merger, which are included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
On June 30, 2020, the Parent contributed approximately $3.7 billion as equity to Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation in conjunction with the closing of the
Merger. The Company provided a return of capital to the Parent in the amount of $924.9 million during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
Product Warranty
The Company’s vendors generally warrant the products distributed by the Company and allow the Company to return defective products, including
those that have been returned to the Company by its customers. The Company typically does not independently warrant the products it distributes;
however, in several countries where the Company operates, the Company is responsible for defective product as a matter of law. The time period required
by law in certain countries exceeds the warranty period provided by the manufacturer. The Company is obligated to provide warranty protection for sales
of certain IT products within the European Union (“EU”) for up to two years as required under the EU directive where vendors have not affirmatively
agreed to provide pass-through protection. In addition to situations where pass-through protection is required by law, the Company does warrant
services with regard to products integrated for its customers. A provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale and periodically
adjusted to reflect actual experience. To date, the Company has not incurred any significant warranty costs related to either legal requirements or
services.
Income Taxes
The Company’s calculation of income taxes is based on current enacted tax laws and tax rates of each tax jurisdiction. Due to the Company’s global
structure, the estimation and calculation of income taxes involves the interpretation and application of complex statutes, regulations, and case law in
multiple jurisdictions, including the income tax impact of the legal entity ownership structure, which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and
judgment.
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the fiscal period
that includes the enactment date.
The Company considers all positive and negative evidence available in determining the potential realization of deferred tax assets, including the
scheduled reversal of temporary differences, recent cumulative losses, recent and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies. In making this determination, the Company places greater emphasis on recent cumulative losses and recent taxable income due to the inherent
lack of subjectivity associated with these factors. In addition, the Company is subject to the periodic examination of its income tax returns by the Internal
Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s financial instruments, which are subject to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are deposited and/or invested with various financial
institutions globally that are monitored on a regular basis by the Company for credit quality.
The Company sells its products to a large base of value-added resellers, direct marketers, retailers, corporate resellers and managed service providers.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company has obtained credit insurance
which insures a percentage of credit extended by the Company to certain of its customers against possible loss. The Company maintains provisions for
estimated credit losses. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31,
2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company also enters into foreign currency exchange contracts. In the event of a failure to honor one of these contracts by one of the banks with
which the Company has contracted, the Company believes any loss would be limited in most circumstances to the exchange rate differential from the time
the contract was executed until the time the contract was settled. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts are executed with various financial
institutions globally and are monitored on a regular basis by the Company for credit quality.
Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement
The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are translated into U.S. dollars
using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using weighted average exchange rates for
each period during the year. Translation gains and losses are reported as components of “accumulated other comprehensive income”, included within
shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Prior to the Merger, Merger Sub entered into two interest rate swaps in order to hedge the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on expected borrowings
under the Asset Based Credit Agreement in conjunction with the closing of the Merger. Upon the closing of the Merger, the Company assumed these
interest rate swaps which convert the interest payable on the Asset Based Credit Agreement Term Loans from a variable rate to a fixed rate. The interest
rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company also previously held a cross-currency swap that was designated as a cash flow hedge to
hedge its cash flows related to certain foreign-currency denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated
and qualifying as cash flow hedges is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). These gains and losses are subsequently
reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same statement of operations
line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. The Company has classified cash flows related to its interest rate swaps as operating activities and
cash flows related to the settlement of its cross-currency swap as financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The Company previously used foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of its net
investment in foreign-currency denominated operations. The Company terminated these net investment hedges during the period from February 1, 2020
to June 30, 2020. Gains and losses on net investment hedges resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates compared to those per the forward contract
were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) during the predecessor period.
 
165
Table of Contents
Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2020 were eliminated as part of purchase accounting in conjunction with
the Merger. Prior to the termination of the net investment hedges, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness was recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in interest expense, net on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The Company classified cash flows related to the settlement of its net investment hedges as investing activities in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The Company additionally utilizes forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to reduce exposure to foreign currency risk. The
derivative instruments are marked-to-market each period with gains and losses on these contracts recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
Operations within “cost of products sold” for derivative instruments used to manage the Company’s exposure to foreign denominated accounts
receivable and accounts payable and within “other expense, net,” for derivative instruments used to manage the Company’s exposure to foreign
denominated financing transactions. Such mark-to-market gains and losses are recorded in the period in which their value changes, with the offsetting
entry for unsettled positions being recorded to either “prepaid expenses and other assets” or “accrued expenses and other liabilities” in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company classifies cash flows related to the settlement of forward contracts that are not designated as hedging
instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
It is the Company’s policy to utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce risk where appropriate and prohibit entering into derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources, and is comprised of “net income” and “other comprehensive income (loss).” The Company’s “accumulated other
comprehensive income” is comprised of changes in the Company’s currency translation adjustment account and the effective portion of changes in the
fair value of its cash flow hedges.
Stock-Based Compensation
Prior to the Merger, the Company awarded certain employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors restricted stock, options to purchase
common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance awards that were dependent upon achievement of specified performance goals. Subsequent to
the Merger, certain of the Company’s employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors have been granted equity awards in the Parent.
The Company records expenses for all equity-based awards, including employee awards and non-employee director awards related to the Parent, in
operating expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations based on their fair values determined on the date of grant. The Company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards other than performance-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
of the award. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost associated with performance-based awards over the requisite service period if it
is probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures based on the
Company’s historical experience.
Treasury Stock
Treasury stock for the predecessor entity was accounted for at cost. Shares that were repurchased by the Company prior to the Merger were held in
treasury for general corporate purposes, including issuances under equity incentive and benefit plans. The reissuance of shares from treasury stock was
based on the weighted average purchase price of the shares. The Company’s treasury stock was eliminated during the Merger.
Contingencies
The Company accrues for contingent obligations, including estimated legal costs, when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably
estimable. As facts concerning contingencies become known, the Company
 
166
Table of Contents
reassesses its position and makes appropriate adjustments to the financial statements. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include
those related to tax, legal and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports, the imposition of international governmental controls, changes in the
interpretation and enforcement of international laws (particularly related to items such as duty and taxation), and the impact of local economic conditions
and practices, which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation
process.
Legal settlements and other litigation, net
The Company has been a claimant in proceedings seeking damages from certain manufacturers of LCD flat panel and cathode ray tube displays as well as
reimbursement from insurance providers of certain costs incurred by the Company associated with the restatement of certain of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and other financial information from fiscal 2009 to 2013. The Company reached settlement agreements during the
periods presented and has recorded these amounts, net of attorney fees and expenses, in “legal settlements and other litigation, net,” in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.
The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business (see Note 14 – Commitments and
Contingencies for further information).
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 which revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of the
recognition of those losses. Under the new standard, financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis are to be presented net of the amount not
expected to be collected via an allowance for credit losses. Estimated credit losses are to be based on historical information adjusted for management’s
expectation that current conditions and supportable forecasts differ from historical experience. The Company adopted this standard during the quarter
ending April 30, 2020. The adoption of this standard had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform on
financial reporting. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying existing guidance to contract modifications, hedging
relationships and other transactions that are expected to be affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. The amendments in the guidance
are elective and were effective beginning March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 to refine the scope
of the March 2020 accounting standard and clarify some of its guidance as part of the FASB’s monitoring of global reference rate activities. The
amendments in this guidance were effective immediately for all entities. The company adopted the provisions of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 on a
prospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 which simplifies and clarifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance. The accounting
standard is effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year 2022, with early adoption permitted. Certain amendments should be applied
prospectively, while other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presents. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this
new standard.
Subsequent Events
The Company evaluated subsequent events through April 16, 2021, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

As a result of the Merger, the Company recorded its property and equipment at fair value as of June 30, 2020 (see Note 4 – Acquisitions for additional
information). During the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the Company sold one of its logistics facilities and further executed sale-leaseback
transactions for an office facility and five other logistics facilities which were accounted for as sales (see Note 6 – Sale of Fixed Assets and Disposal of
Subsidiary for further information). Depreciation expense totaled $23.4 million, $15.3 million, $35.7 million and $34.4 million for the period from July 1, 2020
to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment tests for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were performed as of November 1, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and did not
result in an impairment. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2019 as of November 1, 2018 which indicated that the
carrying value of the Company’s Asia-Pacific reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. In estimating the fair value of the Asia-Pacific reporting
unit, a discounted cash flow approach and market approach were utilized. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach were based on
historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, working capital requirements, economic conditions and other relevant factors. The assumptions used
in the market approach were based on the value of a business through an analysis of multiples of guideline companies and recent sales or offerings of a
comparable entity. The estimated fair value developed under the discounted cash flow and market approaches decreased in comparison to the Company’s
prior estimates primarily due to lower operating results and increased investments in the region as compared to expectations. As a result, goodwill
impairment expense of $47.4 million was recorded during the year ended January 31, 2019, representing the amount by which the carrying value of the
Asia-Pacific reporting unit exceeded its fair value.

relationships and capitalized software and development costs; as of January 31, 2021, the Company did not have any other intangible assets. Prior to the
Merger, other intangible assets were primarily comprised of trade names from previous acquisitions. The Company capitalized intangible assets of
approximately $262.9 million and $21.6 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019,
 
169

NOTE 4 — Acquisitions
The Merger
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on June 30, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into Tech Data Corporation, with Tech Data Corporation surviving the
Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiger Midco. Tiger Midco, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, acquired
all the outstanding shares of Tech Data Corporation’s common stock (other than shares held by Tech Data Corporation as treasury stock or held by
certain affiliates of the Apollo Funds) for $145 per share in cash. Additionally, per the terms of the Merger Agreement, all nonvested restricted stock units
(“RSU’s”) were vested, cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of $145 per share in cash. Nonvested performance based restricted
stock units (“PRSU’s”) were also cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of $145 per share in cash determined as follows: (i) for
PRSU’s granted during fiscal 2019, the number of shares equaled 130% of the target shares granted and (ii) for PRSU’s granted during fiscal 2020, the
number of shares equaled 110% of the target shares granted. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $5.2 billion.
The Parent contributed approximately $3.7 billion as equity to Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation in conjunction with the Merger, of which approximately
$3.6 billion was used to fund the purchase price for Tech Data Corporation. The remaining purchase price for Tech Data Corporation was financed
through the issuance of debt (see Note 7 – Debt for further discussion) and cash on hand at Tech Data Corporation.
The Company has accounted for the Merger as a business combination and allocated the purchase price to the estimated fair values of Tech Data
Corporation’s assets and liabilities. The Company has not yet completed its evaluation and determination of certain assets and liabilities, primarily (i) the
final assessment and valuation of certain assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable and accounts payable and (iii) the final assessment and
valuation of certain income tax amounts. Therefore, the final fair values of the assets and liabilities may vary from the Company’s preliminary estimates.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows:

The allocation of the value of identifiable intangible assets includes approximately $2.1 billion of customer relationships with amortization periods ranging
from 10 years to 15 years, with a weighted average amortization period of 14 years and $622 million of indefinite-lived trade names. Goodwill is the excess
of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and primarily represents future economic benefits arising from assets

Innovix Acquisition
On September 30, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Innovix Distribution (“Innovix”), a leading technology distributor in the Asia-Pacific
region for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $52 million in cash. The Innovix acquisition expands the Company’s presence across
the Asia-Pacific region and strengthens its Endpoint Solutions and Advanced Solutions capabilities.
The Company has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination and allocated the preliminary estimated purchase price to the estimated fair
values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including cash of approximately $21 million, accounts receivable of approximately $121 million,
inventory of approximately $41 million and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of approximately $107 million. The excess of
the estimated fair values of the net tangible assets over the preliminary estimated purchase price was recorded as a gain on bargain purchase of
$30.2 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. The Company acquired the net assets of
Innovix for an amount less than fair value as its former parent decided to exit this business after it concluded that Innovix represented an insignificant,
non-strategic portion of its consolidated operations.
The Company has not yet completed its evaluation and determination of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, primarily (i) the final assessment
and valuation of certain other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including accounts receivable, inventory, accrued expenses and other liabilities and
(ii) the final assessment and valuation of certain tax amounts. Therefore, the final fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may vary from
the Company’s preliminary estimates. Pro forma information for the acquisition of Innovix has not been provided as the acquisition was not material to the
Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
DLT Acquisition
On November 25, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of DLT, a premier software and cloud solutions aggregator focused on the U.S. public
sector. The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of DLT for a purchase price of approximately $209 million in cash. The DLT acquisition
enables the Company to proactively
 
172
Table of Contents
develop opportunities, accelerate growth and simplify complexity for its channel partners that are serving the U.S. public sector space.
The Company has accounted for the DLT acquisition as a business combination and allocated the purchase price to the fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:

The allocation of the value of identifiable intangible assets is comprised of approximately $193.0 million of customer and vendor relationships with an
amortization period of 15 years and $18.4 million of trade names with an amortization period of 10 years. Goodwill is the excess of the consideration
transferred over the net assets recognized and primarily represents the expected cost synergies of the combined company and assembled workforce and
is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. As a result of the Merger on June 30, 2020, these intangible assets and goodwill are no longer separately
recognized and are included within the intangible assets and goodwill recorded as part of the allocation of the purchase price for the Merger. Pro forma
information for the acquisition of DLT has not been provided as the acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.
Acquisition of Avnet, Inc.’s (“Avnet”) Technology Solutions business (TS)
On February 27, 2017, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of TS for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion, comprised of
approximately $2.5 billion in cash and 2,785,402 shares of the Company’s common stock. The consideration payable to Avnet was subject to certain
working capital and other adjustments, as determined through the process established in the interest purchase agreement. In August 2018, the Company
executed a settlement agreement with Avnet, resulting in a final working capital adjustment of $120 million which was paid to Avnet in fiscal 2019. As the
measurement period had concluded, a gain of $9.6 million was recorded in “acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses” in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the year ended January 31, 2019, representing the difference between the final working capital adjustment and the Company’s
prior estimate. Additionally, as part of the settlement agreement, the Company and Avnet reached agreement on the final geographic allocation of the
purchase price for tax reporting purposes which resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in the U.S. for future tax deductions related to the
amortization of goodwill for tax purposes. The recognition of the deferred tax asset in the U.S. resulted in an income tax benefit of $13.0 million during
fiscal 2019.

Table of Contents
NOTE 5 — Acquisition, Integration and Restructuring Expenses
Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of costs related to the Merger, the new Global Optimization Program initiated
in fiscal 2021 (the “GBO 2 Program”), the prior Global Business Optimization Program which was initiated in fiscal 2019 (the “GBO Program”), the tdONE
Program and the fiscal 2018 acquisition of TS.
The Merger
The Company incurred transaction costs related to the completion of the Merger, including professional services costs, stock-based compensation
expense and personnel and other costs. Professional services costs are primarily comprised of investment banking fees, legal expenses, and tax and other
consulting services. Stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to charges associated with the accelerated vesting of RSU’s and PRSU’s
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Personnel and other costs are primarily comprised of severance costs, including amounts due to
employees pursuant to the Company’s Change in Control Severance Policy, as well as retention costs.
Additionally, the Company recorded approximately $37 million of professional services costs during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021
related to services associated with start-up activities, specifically organization costs, as well as transaction costs related to the Merger, directed by Tiger
Midco on behalf of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation. The nature of these services included legal services, investment banking services and tax and other
consulting services.

In conjunction with the completion of the Merger, in fiscal 2021 the Company began its GBO 2 Program. The GBO 2 Program includes investments that
will optimize and standardize processes and apply data and analytics to be more agile in a rapidly evolving environment, increasing productivity,
profitability and optimizing net-working capital. Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses related to the GBO 2 Program are primarily comprised
of restructuring costs and other professional services costs. Restructuring costs are comprised of severance costs and other associated exit costs,
including certain consulting costs. Other professional services costs are primarily comprised of professional services fees not related to restructuring
activities, including costs related to improving profitability and optimizing net-working capital. The Company’s estimate of total acquisition, integration,
and restructuring expenses under the GBO 2 program is $175 million to $200 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred through fiscal 2023.

NOTE 6 — Sale of Fixed Assets and Disposal of Subsidiary
Sale-leaseback Transactions
During fiscal 2021, the Company executed sale-leaseback transactions for an office facility and five logistics facilities that it previously owned throughout
the United States. The carrying value of these properties totaled $252.4 million and the sale-leaseback transactions resulted in net cash proceeds of
$272.7 million. These transactions qualified as sales for accounting purposes and resulted in a net gain of $20.1 million, which is included in “gain on sale
of fixed assets” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. The leases for the logistics facilities and
the office facility are each for a fifteen year noncancelable term and contain renewal options for up to six additional five-year periods. The Company has
recorded operating lease right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities of approximately $174.0 million in relation to the lease
agreements for these logistics facilities. Future minimum lease payments for the office facility and five logistics facilities in total average approximately
$15.7 million per year.
Sale of Facility
During fiscal 2021, the Company sold one of its logistics facilities located in the United States for net cash proceeds of $42.2 million from the transaction.
The carrying value of this facility was $46.8 million and the company recorded a loss of $4.6 million in “gain on sale of fixed assets” on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
Disposal of Subsidiary
During fiscal 2019, the Company executed an agreement to sell certain of its operations in Ireland for a total sales price of approximately $15.3 million. The
Company recorded a gain on sale of $6.7 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, which includes the reclassification of $5.1 million from
accumulated other comprehensive income for cumulative translation adjustments associated with the Company’s investment in this foreign entity. The
Company recorded an additional gain on the sale of this entity of $1.4 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The operating results of this
entity during fiscal 2019 were insignificant relative to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

Senior Notes
In January 2017, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.70% Senior Notes due February 15, 2022 (the “2022 Senior Notes”)
and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.95% Senior Notes due February 15, 2027 (the “2027 Senior Notes”) (collectively the “Senior Notes”).
The Company pays interest on the Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The interest rate payable on the
Senior Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit rating assigned to such series of notes changes. At no point will the interest rate
be reduced below the interest rate payable on the notes on the date of the initial issuance or increase more than 2.00% above the interest rate payable on
the notes of the series on the date of their initial issuance. The interest rate payable on the Senior Notes initially increased by 1.00% as a result of the
Merger and subsequent to January 31, 2021 has further increased an additional 1.00%. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Tech Data
Corporation and will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.
The Company, at its option, may redeem the 2022 Senior Notes at any time prior to January 15, 2022 and the 2027 Senior Notes at any time prior to
November 15, 2026, in each case in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be
redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed,
discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points for the 2022
Senior Notes and 40 basis points for the 2027 Senior Notes, plus the accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed up to the date
of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Senior Notes, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, on or after January 15, 2022 for the 2022
Senior Notes and November 15, 2026 for the 2027 Senior Notes, in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior
Notes to be redeemed.
On March 10, 2020, Merger Sub launched an offer to purchase for cash any and all of the Company’s outstanding 2022 Senior Notes and any and all of
the Company’s outstanding 2027 Senior Notes and a consent solicitation to amend the indenture and global securities establishing the 2022 Senior Notes
and the 2027 Senior Notes to (i) eliminate the requirement to make a “change of control” offer in connection with the proposed merger of Merger Sub into
Tech Data Corporation pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (ii) make certain other
 
179
Table of Contents
customary changes for a privately-held company to the “change of control” provisions (the “Proposed Amendments”). Concurrently with, but separate
from, the aforementioned offer to purchase and consent solicitation, Merger Sub launched a consent solicitation for the Proposed Amendments for
holders of the 2027 Senior Notes. On March 24, 2020, Merger Sub announced that the requisite more than 50% of consents were received to adopt the
Proposed Amendments. The aforementioned consent solicitations were conducted by Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the conditions
set forth in, the offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement, dated March 10, 2020 (the “Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation”), and the
separate consent solicitation statement, dated March 10, 2020 (the “2027 Consent Solicitation” and, together with the Offer to Purchase and Consent
Solicitation, the “Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statements”). On March 24, 2020, the Company entered into a Supplemental Indenture with
respect to the Indenture and Global Security for the 2022 Senior Notes (the “2022 Supplemental Indenture”) and a Supplemental Indenture with respect to
the Indenture and Global Security for the 2027 Senior Notes (the “2027 Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the 2022 Supplemental Indenture, the
“Supplemental Indentures”) effecting the Proposed Amendments.
On June 30, 2020, upon consummation of the Merger and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, Merger Sub accepted and paid for approximately
$434.1 million principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes and approximately $369.4 million principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes.
Asset Based Credit Agreement
On June 30, 2020, as part of the Merger transaction, the Company entered into an approximately $4.9 billion Asset Based Credit Agreement (the “ABL”)
with a syndicate of banks. The ABL is comprised of (i) a $2.8 billion revolving credit facility (the “ABL Revolver”), (ii) a $1.7 billion Non- First-In Last-Out
(“FILO”) Term Loan and (iii) a $370 million FILO Term Loan. The ABL facilities constitute senior debt of the Company that is secured by a first priority lien
by a pledge of Tech Data Corporation’s capital stock directly held by Tiger Midco and first-priority security interests in substantially all of Tech Data
Corporation’s accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (other than intellectual property), bank accounts and cash, and books and records
related to the foregoing, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.
The ABL Revolver provides for (i) a maturity date of June 30, 2025 (ii) an interest rate on borrowings, facility fees and letter of credit fees based on
average availability under the ABL Revolver and (iii) certain subsidiaries of the Company to be designated as borrowers. The applicable borrower pays
interest on advances under the ABL Revolver based on LIBOR (or similar interbank offered rate depending on currency draw) plus a predetermined
margin that is based on the Company’s average revolving availability. There was $31.2 million outstanding under the ABL Revolver at January 31, 2021, at
an interest rate of 1.50%.
The Non-FILO Term Loan and FILO Term Loan (collectively, the “ABL Term Loans”) have a maturity date of June 30, 2025. The Company pays interest at
a variable rate based on LIBOR (or similar interbank offered rate depending on currency draw) plus, in each case, a fixed predetermined margin. The
Company entered into two interest rate swaps which convert the interest payable on the ABL Term Loans from a variable rate to a fixed rate (see Note 11 –
Derivative Instruments for further discussion). The Company must repay 0.25% of the original principal amount of the ABL Term Loans on a quarterly
basis. Any refinancing through the issuance of certain debt or any repricing amendment, in either case, that constitutes a “repricing event” applicable to
the ABL Term Loans resulting in a lower yield will be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium or fee, as applicable, if any such repricing event
occurs, (i) with respect to the Non-FILO Term Loan, at any time during the first six months after the closing date of the ABL and (ii) with respect to the
FILO Term Loan, at any time during the first twelve months after the closing date of the ABL. Otherwise, the ABL Term Loans may be repaid at any time,
without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs, except that, subject to certain exceptions, the FILO Term Loan may not be prepaid prior
to the payment in full of any amounts outstanding under the ABL Revolver and the Non-FILO Term Loan. At January 31, 2021, the Company had
approximately $1.7 billion outstanding under the Non-FILO Term Loan and $369.1 million outstanding under the FILO Term Loan.
 
180
Table of Contents
The ABL Revolver includes a springing financial maintenance covenant based on availability under the ABL Revolver. At January 31, 2021, the financial
maintenance covenant did not apply. In addition, the ABL contains covenants that would restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur
certain debt and liens, make certain dividends and other restricted payments, make certain investments, sell certain assets and enter into certain
transactions with affiliates. The ABL also contains certain customary events of default, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default
occurs, the lenders under the ABL are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL and all actions permitted
to be taken by a secured creditor in respect of the collateral securing the ABL.
Other Credit Facilities
The Company had a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Agreement”) which, among other things, provided for (i) a
maturity date of May 15, 2024, (ii) an interest rate on borrowings, facility fees and letter of credit fees based on the Company’s debt rating, (iii) the ability
to increase the facility to a maximum of $1.75 billion, subject to certain conditions and (iv) certain subsidiaries of the Company to be designated as
borrowers. The applicable borrower paid interest on advances under the Credit Agreement based on LIBOR (or similar interbank offered rates depending
on currency draw) plus a predetermined margin that was based on the Company’s debt rating. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit
Agreement at January 31, 2020 and the Credit Agreement was terminated on June 30, 2020 as part of the Merger transaction.
On August 2, 2019, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “2019 Term Loan Credit Agreement”) which, among other things,
(i) provided for a $300 million term loan credit facility with a maturity date of August 2, 2021, (ii) provided for an interest rate on the outstanding principal
amount of the loan that was based on LIBOR plus a predetermined margin and (iii) was able to be increased up to a total of $500 million, subject to certain
conditions. The Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2019 Term Loan Credit Agreement at January 31, 2020. On June 30, 2020, in conjunction
with the Merger, the Company repaid the $300 million outstanding and the 2019 Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated.
The Company also had an agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “Receivables Securitization Program”) that allowed the Company to transfer an
undivided interest in a designated pool of U.S. accounts receivable, on an ongoing basis, to provide collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of
$1.0 billion. Under this program, the Company transferred certain U.S. trade receivables into a wholly- owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity.
Such receivables, which were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled approximately $1.6 billion at January 31, 2020. As collections reduced
accounts receivable balances included in the collateral pool, the Company was able to transfer interests in new receivables to bring the amount available
to be borrowed up to the maximum. Interest was paid on advances under the Receivables Securitization Program at the applicable commercial paper or
LIBOR rate plus an agreed-upon margin. There were no amounts outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Program at January 31, 2020. The
Receivables Securitization Program was terminated on June 30, 2020 as part of the Merger transaction.
In addition to the facilities described above, the Company has various other committed and uncommitted lines of credit, short-term loans and overdraft
facilities totaling approximately $389.9 million at January 31, 2021 to support its operations. Most of these facilities are provided on an unsecured, short-
term basis and are reviewed periodically for renewal. There was $80.2 million outstanding on these facilities at January 31, 2021, at a weighted average
interest rate of 6.74%, and there was $108.4 million outstanding at January 31, 2020, at a weighted average interest rate of 6.79%.
At January 31, 2021, the Company had also issued standby letters of credit of $129.1 million. These letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of

U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) which significantly revised U.S. corporate
income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax
system that included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for
U.S. Tax Reform, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118 which required that the Company include in its financial statements the
reasonable estimate of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate had been determined. SAB 118 allowed the
Company to report provisional amounts within a measurement period up to one year due to the complexities inherent in adopting the changes.
Accordingly, in fiscal 2018, the Company recorded its provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. During fiscal 2019, the
Company finalized its analysis of the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and decreased its estimate of the one-time transition tax by $49.2 million,
primarily due to further analysis of earnings and profits of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the utilization of foreign tax credits.
Additionally, U.S. Tax Reform subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.
The Company has made the accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense.

The increase in the Company’s overall deferred tax liability position is primarily due to the increase in the Company’s identified intangible assets recorded
as a result of the Merger (see Note 4 – Acquisitions for further discussion). As of January 31, 2021, there are no outside basis differences in foreign
subsidiaries which would require any material deferred taxes to be recorded.
In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $8.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to changes in deferred tax
valuation allowances. The net change in the deferred tax valuation allowances in fiscal 2021 was an increase of $6.9 million primarily resulting from an
increase in certain foreign jurisdictions. The net change in the deferred tax valuation allowances in fiscal 2020 was an increase of $5.2 million primarily
resulting from an increase in certain foreign jurisdictions.
The valuation allowances at both January 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily relate to carryforwards for foreign net operating losses and foreign tax credits in the
United States. The Company’s net operating loss carryforwards totaled $495.9 million and $489.4 million at January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
majority of the net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period with the remaining portion expiring in fiscal years 2022 through 2038. The
Company’s foreign tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. totaled $51.2 million and $51.1 million at January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The foreign tax
credits have a ten year carryforward period, and the majority are set to expire in fiscal year 2028. The Company considers all positive and negative
evidence available in determining the potential of realizing deferred tax assets. To the extent that the Company generates consistent taxable income within
those operations with valuation allowances, the Company may reduce the valuation allowances, thereby reducing income tax expense and increasing net
income in the period the determination is made.
The estimates and assumptions used by the Company in computing the income taxes reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements could
differ from the actual results reflected in the income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments are recorded based on filed returns when
such returns are finalized or the related adjustments are identified.

At January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $16.2 million,
$18.3 million and $23.1 million, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of TS, pursuant to the interest purchase agreement, the Company and
Avnet agreed to indemnify each other in relation to certain tax matters. As a result, the Company has recorded certain indemnification assets for expected
amounts to be received from Avnet related to liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company has also recorded certain indemnification
liabilities for expected amounts to be paid to Avnet. During the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020
and 2019, due to the resolution of certain pre-acquisition tax matters and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation, the Company recorded benefits in
income tax expense of $0.6 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively. As a result, the Company recorded expenses of $0.6 million, $1.2 million and
$9.6 million, during the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are
included in “selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, related to changes in the corresponding
indemnification assets and liabilities recorded. The net impact of these items had no impact on the Company’s net income.
Unrecognized tax benefits that have a reasonable possibility of significantly decreasing within the 12 months following January 31, 2021 totaled
$2.3 million, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized, primarily related to the foreign taxation of certain transactions. Consistent with
prior periods, the Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The Company’s
accrued interest at January 31, 2021, would not have a material impact on the effective tax rate if reversed. The provision for income taxes for the period
from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019
includes interest expense on unrecognized income tax benefits for current and prior years which is not significant to the Company’s Consolidated
Statement of Income. The change in the balance of accrued interest for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, includes the current year end accrual, an interest
benefit resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitation, and the translation adjustments on foreign currencies.
The Company conducts business primarily in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, and as a result, one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax
returns in the U.S. federal, various state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by
taxing authorities. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before fiscal 2018, except for the fiscal
2021 net operating loss to be carried back to fiscal 2016. Income tax returns of various foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2006 and forward are currently under
taxing authority examination or remain subject to audit.

NOTE 9 — Employee Benefit Plans
Equity Awards in the Parent
Subsequent to the Merger, certain of the Company’s employees have been granted equity awards (“Series B Units”) in the Parent. Series B Units entitle
the holder to certain rights to receive amounts in cash upon a Substantially All Assets Sale Distribution or a Liquidation Event Distribution, each as
defined in the Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P. Partnership Agreement. A total of 90,000 Series B Units are available for grant. Series B Units with service
conditions only (“Time-based Series B Units”) vest over a five-year period from the date of grant. Series B Units with service, market and performance
conditions (“Performance-based Series B Units”) vest if the total cash return to certain affiliates of Apollo (referred to as “MOIC”) upon a liquidation
event exceeds certain defined thresholds while the holder of the Performance-based Series B Units is employed with the Company. Certain non-employee
members of the Board of Directors of the Company have also been granted preferred shares (“Series A Units”) and common shares in the Parent that vest
over a one-year period from the date of grant.
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $3.0 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 for the Time-based Series B
Units. No expense was recorded for the Performance-based Series B Units as it is not considered probable that the performance conditions will be
satisfied. An immaterial amount of stock-based compensation expense was recorded for both the Series A Units and the common shares for the period
from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.

As of January 31, 2021, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested Time-based Series B Units was $23.7 million, which the
Company expects to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 4.4 years.

As of January 31, 2021, the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested Performance-based Series B Units, assuming maximum
achievement, was $32.8 million.
The Company estimated the value of the Time-based Series B Units and Performance-based Series B Units at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo
simulation framework, where the total equity value of the Parent was solved such that the aggregate value of the Series A Units and common shares
equaled the initial capital contribution in the Parent. The equity value of the Parent was assessed using the Monte Carlo simulation framework over a
period from the grant date to an expected Substantially All Assets Sale Distribution or a Liquidation Event Distribution. The Company estimated the
volatility applicable to the equity value of the Parent based on the
 
187
Table of Contents
observed equity volatility for similar companies while considering the effects of differences in capital structures. In each simulation path, the Company
calculated the MOIC on a fully diluted basis at the liquidity event. The Company used a risk-free interest rate to discount the value of the Series B Units
and applied an estimated discount for lack of marketability to conclude on the fair value of the Series B Units.
The following table describes the key assumptions used in applying the Monte Carlo valuation methodology to estimate the grant date fair value of Time-
based Series B Units and Performance-based Series B Units:

free interest rate 
Expected dividend yield

Additionally, holders of Series B Units are entitled to periodic cash payments based on a predefined percentage of distributions made from the Parent.
Amounts are payable in cash six months after the date of the distribution by the Parent provided the holder of Series B Units remains employed with the
Company. Cash payments received by the holders of Series B Units reduce the amount the holder is entitled to receive in cash upon a Substantially All
Assets Sale Distribution or a Liquidation Event Distribution. The Company recorded expenses of $6.5 million in “selling, general and administrative
expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 related to cash payments due to the
holders of Series B Units.
Equity Incentive Plans
The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders in June 2018 and included 2.0 million shares available for grant. During the
predecessor period, the Company awarded officers, employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors restricted stock, options to
purchase common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance awards that were dependent upon achievement of specified performance goals.
Equity-based compensation awards were used by the Company to attract talent and as a retention mechanism for the award recipients and had a maximum
term of ten years, unless a shorter period was specified by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (“Compensation
Committee”) or was required under local law. Awards under the plan were priced as determined by the Compensation Committee and were required to be
priced at, or above, the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards generally vested between one year and three
years from the date of grant. The Company’s policy was to utilize shares of its treasury stock, to the extent available, to satisfy its obligation to issue
shares upon the exercise of awards.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon closing of the Merger all nonvested RSU’s were vested, cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount of $145 per share in cash. Nonvested PRSU’s were also cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of $145 per share
in cash determined as follows: (i) for PRSU’s granted during fiscal 2019, the number of shares equaled 130% of the target shares granted and (ii) for
PRSU’s granted during fiscal 2020, the number of shares equaled 110% of the target shares granted. The Company recognized $20.4 million of stock-based
compensation expense within “acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses” during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, related to the
acceleration of the vesting of nonvested RSU and PRSU awards.
For the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and
2019, the Company recorded $20.4 million, $9.2 million, $32.2 million and $31.5 million, respectively, of total stock-based compensation expense related to
awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, and related income tax benefits of $6.3 million, $2.0 million, $7.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively. The
actual benefit received from the tax deduction from the exercise of equity-based incentives was $6.3 million, $10.6 million, $7.0 million and $5.4 million for
the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

Restricted Stock
Prior to the Merger, the Company’s restricted stock awards were primarily in the form of RSUs and typically vested in annual installments lasting between
one year and three years from the date of grant, unless a different vesting schedule was mandated by country law. All of the RSUs had a fair market value
equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense included $10.7 million, $6.4 million,
$23.4 million and $25.4 million related to RSUs during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020
and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 is $27.8 million, $24.7 million, $22.9 million and $21.1 million, respectively.
There were no RSUs granted during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 or the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. The weighted-
average fair value of the 228,528 RSUs granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was $102.43 per share. The weighted-average fair value of
the 280,352 RSUs granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 was $85.50 per share.
Performance based restricted stock units
Prior to the Merger, the Company’s PRSUs were subject to vesting conditions, including meeting specified cumulative performance objectives over a
period of three years. Each performance based award recipient could vest in 0% to 150% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of
the Company’s financial performance metrics. Stock-based compensation expense includes $9.7 million, $2.7 million, $8.5 million and $5.8 million related to
PRSUs during the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31,

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), the Company was authorized to issue up to 1.0 million shares of common stock to eligible
employees in the Company’s U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees could choose to have a fixed dollar amount or
percentage deducted from their bi-weekly compensation to purchase the Company’s common stock and/or elect to purchase shares once per calendar
quarter. The purchase price of the stock was 85% of the market value on the purchase date and employees were limited to a maximum purchase of $25,000
in fair market value each calendar year. Subject to the Merger Agreement, the ESPP was suspended in November 2019. From the inception through
suspension of the program, the Company issued 575,174 shares of common stock to the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP
was insignificant during fiscal 2020 and 2019.
Retirement Savings Plan
The Company sponsors the Tech Data Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan (the “401(k) Savings Plan”) for its U.S. employees. At the Company’s discretion,
participant deferrals are matched in cash, in an amount equal to 50% of the first 6% of participant deferrals and participants are fully vested following four
years of qualified service. Aggregate contributions made by the Company to the 401(k) Savings Plan were $4.4 million, $3.3 million, $7.1 million and
$6.7 million for the period from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31,
2020 and 2019, respectively.

NOTE 10 — Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s assets and liabilities carried or disclosed at fair value are classified in one of the following three categories: Level 1 – quoted market
prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 – inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 above that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and, Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The classification of an asset or liability
within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

The Company’s foreign currency derivative instruments are measured on a recurring basis based on foreign currency spot rates and forward rates quoted
by banks or foreign currency dealers and are marked-to-market each period. The Company’s interest rate swaps are measured on a recurring basis using a
discounted cash flow valuation technique considering the terms of the instrument, discount rates and projected LIBOR rates (see Note 11 – Derivative
Instruments for further discussion).
Prior to the Merger, the Company utilized life insurance policies to fund the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The life insurance
asset, which was recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in “other assets, net”, was the amount that would be realized upon the assumed
surrender of the policy. This amount was based on the underlying fair value of the invested assets contained within the life insurance policies. The gains
and losses were recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations within “other expense, net.” The related deferred compensation
liability, which was recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in “accrued expenses and other liabilities,” was marked-to-market each period
based upon the returns of the various investments selected by the plan participants and the gains and losses were recorded in the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Operations within “selling, general and administrative expenses.”

Table of Contents
As a result of the change in control related to the Merger, participant balances in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan were frozen as
of June 30, 2020. The deferred compensation liability balance was paid in full to participants and the related investments were liquidated during the period
from July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. The net realizable value of the Company’s life insurance investments and related deferred compensation liability was
$41.1 million and $41.0 million, respectively, at January 31, 2020.
The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes is based upon quoted market information (Level 1). The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was
approximately $199.0 million and $1.04 billion, respectively, at January 31, 2021 and 2020 and the carrying value was $198.7 million and $994.3 million,
respectively, at January 31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of these items. The carrying amounts of debt outstanding pursuant to revolving credit facilities and term loans
approximated fair value as the majority of these instruments have variable interest rates which approximate current market rates (Level 2 criteria).

NOTE 11 — Derivative Instruments
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s foreign currency risk
management objective has been to protect earnings and cash flows from the impact of exchange rate changes primarily through the use of foreign
currency forward contracts and a cross-currency swap.
Net Investment Hedges
In fiscal 2020, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated foreign
operations which were designated as net investment hedges. The Company entered into the net investment hedges to offset the risk of change in the
U.S. dollar value of the Company’s investment in a euro functional subsidiary due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. The Company terminated these
net investment hedge contracts during the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 resulting in cash proceeds of $53.4 million.
The following tables present the effects of the Company’s net investment hedges on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and earnings
for the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the year ended January 31, 2021:

Cash Flow Hedges
Prior to the Merger, Merger Sub entered into two interest rate swaps in order to hedge the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on expected borrowings
under the ABL in conjunction with the closing of the Merger. These interest rate swaps convert the interest payable on the ABL Term Loans from a
variable rate to a fixed rate. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of the Merger date. The notional values of the interest rate
swaps totaled $2.0 billion at January 31, 2021 and they are set to mature on August 29, 2025. Additionally, the Company previously entered into a cross-
currency swap to hedge its cash flows related to certain foreign-currency denominated debt which was designated as a cash flow hedge. The notional
value of this swap was $4.5 million at January 31, 2020 and the swap matured in February 2020.

The Company had no cash flow hedges outstanding during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges
The Company additionally utilizes forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany loans, accounts receivable
and accounts payable. The Company’s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from
customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. The Company’s transactions in its foreign operations are denominated
primarily in the following currencies: Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Danish krone, euro, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah,
Mexican peso, Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar.
The Company considers inventory as an economic hedge against foreign currency exposure in accounts payable in certain circumstances. This practice
offsets such inventory against corresponding accounts payable denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary buying
the inventory, when determining the net exposure to be hedged using traditional forward contracts. Under this strategy, the Company would expect to
increase or decrease selling prices for products purchased in foreign currencies based on fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affecting the
underlying accounts payable. To the extent the
 
194
Table of Contents
Company incurs a foreign currency exchange loss (gain) on the underlying accounts payable denominated in the foreign currency, a corresponding
increase (decrease) in gross profit would be expected as the related inventory is sold. This strategy can result in a certain degree of quarterly earnings
volatility as the underlying accounts payable is remeasured using the foreign currency exchange rate prevailing at the end of each period, or settlement
date if earlier, whereas the corresponding increase (decrease) in gross profit is not realized until the related inventory is sold.
The total amount of gains (losses) recognized in earnings on the Company’s derivatives not designated as hedges for the period from July 1, 2020 to

The gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are largely offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged
assets or liabilities. The Company’s average notional amounts of derivatives not designated as hedges outstanding during the period from July 1, 2020 to
January 31, 2021, the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, were approximately $0.9 billion,
$1.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, with average maturities of 26 days, 22 days, 25 days and 25 days, respectively. Under the Company’s
hedging policies, gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments would be expected to continue to be largely offset by the gains and losses on
the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged.
The Company’s derivatives are also discussed in Note 10 – Fair Value Measurements.

NOTE 12 — Shareholders’ Equity
In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $200.0 million of the Company’s common stock. In
February 2019, the Board of Directors approved a $100.0 million increase to the program. In August 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of up to an additional $200.0 million of the Company’s common stock, resulting in a total share repurchase authorization of $500.0 million.
In conjunction with the Company’s share repurchase program, a 10b5-1 plan was executed that instructed the broker selected by the Company to
repurchase shares on behalf of the Company. The amount of common stock repurchased in accordance with the 10b5-1 plan on any given trading day
was determined by a formula in the plan, which was based on the market price of the Company’s common stock. Shares repurchased by the Company
were held in treasury for general corporate purposes, including issuances under equity incentive and benefit plans. The reissuance of shares from
treasury stock was based on the weighted average purchase price of the shares.
The Company’s common share repurchase and issuance activity for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 is summarized as follows:

NOTE 13 — Leases
At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or
operating lease. The Company has operating leases for certain logistics centers, office facilities, vehicles and equipment. The Company’s finance leases
are not material. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the balance sheet. Certain of the
Company’s operating leases contain options to extend the lease, which are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be
exercised. Certain of the Company’s operating leases contain options to terminate the lease; periods after the date of the termination option are included
in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will not exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company has elected to not
separately recognize the lease and non-lease components of a contract for all operating leases.
Operating leases are included in “other assets, net”, “accrued expenses and other liabilities” (for the current portion of lease liabilities) and “other long-
term liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present
value of remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recognized in “selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Variable lease costs are recognized as incurred.
The following table presents the contractual maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of January 31, 2021:

fixed costs for long-term operating leases, but also include immaterial amounts for variable lease costs and short-term operating leases.

NOTE 14 — Commitments and Contingencies
Contingencies
In December 2010, in a non-unanimous decision, a Brazilian appellate court overturned a 2003 trial court which had previously ruled in favor of the
Company’s Brazilian subsidiary related to the imposition of certain taxes on payments abroad related to the licensing of commercial software products,
commonly referred to as “CIDE tax.” The Company estimates the total exposure related to CIDE tax, including interest, was approximately $14.4 million at
January 31, 2021. The Brazilian subsidiary has appealed the unfavorable ruling to the Supreme Court and Superior Court, Brazil’s two highest appellate
courts. Based on the legal opinion of outside counsel, the Company believes that the chances of success on appeal of this matter are favorable and the
Brazilian subsidiary intends to vigorously defend its position that the CIDE tax is not due. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded an accrual for the
total estimated CIDE tax exposure. However, due to the lack of predictability of the Brazilian court system, the Company has concluded that it is
reasonably possible that the Brazilian subsidiary may incur a loss up to the total exposure described above. The Company believes the resolution of this
litigation will not be material to the Company’s consolidated net assets or liquidity.
The French Autorité de la Concurrence (“Competition Authority”) began in 2013 an investigation into the French market for certain products of Apple
Inc., for which the Company is a distributor. In March 2020, the Competition Authority imposed fines on the Company, on another distributor, and on
Apple, finding that the Company entered into an anticompetitive agreement with Apple regarding volume allocations of Apple products. The fine
imposed on the Company was €76 million. The Company has vigorously contested the arguments of the Competition Authority, and the Company has
appealed its determination to the French courts, seeking to set aside or reduce the fine. Although the Company believes it has strong arguments on
appeal, the Company determined during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 that the best estimate of probable loss related to this matter is €36 million. As a
result, during the period from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, the Company recorded a charge of $41.2 million in “legal settlements and other litigation,
net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under French law, the pendency of the Company’s appeal does not suspend the obligation to pay the
fine. The Company has agreed to make eight equal installment payments in relation to the fine assessed for a total amount of €22.8 million on a quarterly
basis from January 2021 through October 2022, the first payment of which was made during fiscal 2021. If the appeal process is not completed prior to the
end of December 2022, the Company may be required to pay further amounts towards the full fine assessed by the Competition Authority before the
Company’s appeal is finally determined. However, any additional amounts that may need to be paid have not yet been determined. Additionally, the
Company has provided a third-party surety bond to the Competition Authority to guarantee the payment of the amount of the fine and interest, if
applicable.
The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s management does not
expect that the outcome in any of these other legal proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Guarantees
As is customary in the technology industry, to encourage certain customers to purchase products, the Company has arrangements with certain finance
companies that provide inventory financing facilities to the Company’s customers. In conjunction with certain of these arrangements, the Company
would be required to purchase certain inventory in the event the inventory is repossessed from the customers by the finance companies. As the
Company does not have access to information regarding the amount of inventory purchased from the Company still on hand with the customer at any
point in time, the Company’s repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated. Repurchases of inventory by the Company
under these arrangements have been insignificant to date. The Company believes that, based on historical experience, the likelihood of a material loss
pursuant to these inventory repurchase obligations is remote.

NOTE 15 — Subsequent Events
On March 22, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “SYNNEX Merger Agreement”) with SYNNEX Corporation
(“SYNNEX”) and its affiliates. Pursuant to the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions described therein, the
affiliates of SYNNEX will acquire all the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock (the “SYNNEX Merger”).
At the effective time of the SYNNEX Merger, except as otherwise set forth in the SYNNEX Merger Agreement, all the issued and outstanding common
shares of the Company will be converted automatically into and thereafter represent only the right to receive (i)
$1,610,000,000 in cash, in the aggregate and (ii) 44,000,000 total shares of common stock of SYNNEX. Prior to the effective date of the SYNNEX Merger,
affiliates of Apollo are required to make an additional equity contribution of at least $500 million in cash to the Company. The completion of the SYNNEX
Merger is also subject to customary closing conditions, including the adoption of the SYNNEX Merger Agreement by a majority of the holders of the
outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock, the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act, certain foreign regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, all
certificates representing shares of Merger Sub I Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which such shares of Merger Sub I Common Stock were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.
(b) Terms of the Exchange. Subject to Section 3.1(e), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Corporate
Merger Effective Time, except for shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II (the
“Cancelled Shares”), shall be converted into the right to receive:

(i) Cash Designation Shares: if a Cash Designation has been validly made with respect to such share of Company Common Stock and remains in effect at
the Designation Deadline (a “Cash Designation Share”), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to an amount such that the sum of the Cash
Designation Consideration and the Mixed Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration (such consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.5(b)(i), the “Cash Designation Consideration”);
(ii) Stock Designation Shares: if a Stock Designation has been validly made with respect to such share of Company Common Stock and remains in effect
at the Designation Deadline (a “Stock Designation Share”), a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
such that the sum of the Stock Designation Consideration and the Mixed Stock Consideration equals the Aggregate Stock Consideration (the “Exchange
Ratio,” and such shares pursuant to this Section 2.5(b)(ii), the “Stock Designation Consideration”); or
(iii) Mixed Designation Shares: if a Mixed Designation has been validly made with respect to such share of Company Common Stock and remains in effect
at the Designation Deadline or no designation has been validly made with respect to such share of Company Common Stock which designation remains
in effect at the Designation Deadline (a “Mixed Designation Share”), (A)(1) the excess of the Aggregate Cash Consideration less the aggregate Cash
Designation Consideration divided by (2) the total number of Mixed Designation Shares (the “Mixed Cash Consideration” and, the aggregate Mixed Cash
Consideration together with the aggregate Cash Designation Consideration, the “Cash Merger Consideration”) and (B) a number of validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (1) the excess of the Aggregate Stock Consideration less the aggregate Stock
Designation Consideration divided by (2) the total number of Mixed Designation Shares (the “Mixed Stock Consideration,” and the aggregate Mixed
Stock Consideration together with the aggregate Stock Designation Consideration, the “Stock Merger Consideration”).
For the absence of doubt, the sum of the Cash Designation Consideration and the Mixed Cash Consideration shall equal, and shall not exceed, the
Aggregate Cash Consideration, and the sum of the Stock Designation Consideration and the Mixed Stock Consideration shall equal, and shall not exceed,
the Aggregate Stock Consideration. The Company shall only make Designations that, in the aggregate, comply with the limitation contained in the
immediately preceding sentence. “Aggregate Cash Consideration” shall mean $1,610,000,000. “Aggregate Stock Consideration” shall mean 44,000,000
shares of Parent Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, any Designation may be made pursuant to this Section 2.5 with respect to fractional shares
of Company Common Stock.
(c) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration or the Stock Merger Consideration
(the “Merger Consideration”) pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of
the Corporate Merger Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an “Old Certificate,” it being understood that any reference herein to “Old Certificate”
shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) in the case of Old Certificates representing
Stock Designation Shares, (A) a book-entry representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such shares of Company Common
Stock have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.5, (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.5 and Section 3.1(e), without
any interest thereon and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1, in each case, without
any interest thereon, (ii) in the case of Old Certificates representing Cash Designation Shares, $[•] in cash, without interest thereon and (iii) in the case of
Old Certificates representing Mixed Designation Shares, (A) a book-entry representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such
shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.5, (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares which

to Section 3.1 and (D) the amount of cash which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 2.5, in each case, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities
(other than pursuant to Section 7.21) as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split or reverse stock split, or there shall be any
extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, the Stock Merger Consideration
and the Cash Merger Consideration, as applicable, to give Parent and the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to permit Parent or the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement and provided further that cash
dividends issued by Parent in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice shall not result in any changes to the Exchange Ratio.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Corporate Merger Effective Time, all Cancelled Shares shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no Stock Merger Consideration, Cash Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
2.6 Effect of the LLC Merger on Securities. At the LLC Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the LLC Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
the Company, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the holders of any securities of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, each share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and each equity interest of Merger
Sub II issued and outstanding immediately prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding as an equity interest of the
Surviving Entity.
2.7 Certificate of Incorporation of the Combined Company.
(a) Subject to the approval of the Authorized Share Charter Amendment by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock

Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, as amended pursuant to Section 2.7(a), shall continue as the
certificate of incorporation of the Combined Company from and after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with its
terms and applicable Law.
2.8 Bylaws of the Combined Company. Subject to the occurrence of the Closing, Parent shall cause the Bylaws of Parent (the “Parent Bylaws”), as in

ARTICLE III
EXCHANGE OF SHARES
3.1 Exchange of Shares.
(a) Upon the Corporate Merger Effective Time, each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration to which such holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article II
together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article III and any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Cash
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.1, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Corporate Merger Effective Time to represent only the right
 
A-13
Table of Contents
to receive, upon surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this Section 3.1. In respect of the Stock Merger Consideration, Parent shall deliver to the applicable holders of Old Certificates, at
Parent’s option, certificates or evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock payable in respect thereof.
(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with an ex dividend and record date after the Closing with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article III. After the
surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article III in respect of which Stock Merger Consideration is payable pursuant to Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive.
(c) If any payment of Merger Consideration is to be made in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting
such exchange shall pay to Parent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
(d) After the Corporate Merger Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time. If, after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, Old
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration
as provided in this Article III.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Combined Company. In lieu of
the issuance of any such fractional share, the Combined Company shall pay to each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the
closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days
ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such
holder immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for
purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.
(f) None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, the Surviving Entity, the Combined Company or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.
 
A-14
Table of Contents
(g) Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Entity and the Combined Company, and any other person that has any
withholding obligation with respect to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment made
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Combined Company, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Combined Company may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Old Certificate, Parent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
ARTICLE IV

“Parent Disclosure Schedule”); provided, that (i) the mere inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of
Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article IV to
the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such

qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed
or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. True and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of Parent, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by Parent to the Company. Parent has taken all necessary corporate action to amend the Parent Bylaws as set forth on Exhibit D as of the date of

licensed or qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified or in
good standing and in which the failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now

bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws of general applicability affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of
equitable remedies (the “Enforceability Exceptions”)). The Investor Rights Agreement will be duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P.) will constitute a valid and binding obligation of Parent in accordance

obligation to which Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any Parent Subsidiary is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or
assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, losses of benefits, defaults, terminations or rights

or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof; (ii) make, or cause to be made, the registrations, declarations and filings (A) required under the HSR

(iii) prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits,

authorizations of all such Governmental Entities, and (iv) seek to avoid or prevent the initiation of any investigation, claim, action, suit, arbitration,
litigation or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.
(b) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objection that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in furtherance of the parties’ reasonable best efforts, each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals or any necessary approvals of any other
Governmental Entity required for the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable or to avoid the consequences in
Section 7.1(a)(iv) or otherwise in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals required pursuant to any Competition Law, shall (i) propose,
negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other encumbrance, or holding separate,
of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein; and (ii) take or agree to take any other action, agree or consent to,
make any concession in respect of, or permit or suffer to exist any condition or requirement setting forth, any limitations or restrictions on freedom of

(any matter set forth in clause (i) or (ii), a “Remedy”), provided that neither party nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any of the actions referred
to above with respect to a Remedy unless the effectiveness thereof is conditioned on the occurrence of the Corporate Merger Effective Time, and
provided, further, that nothing shall require either party to, and neither party shall without the consent of the other party, agree or consent to a Remedy
that would be or would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

appropriate response in substantial compliance with such request. If Parent or the Company receives a formal request for additional information or
documentary material from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“Antitrust Division”), then
Parent and the Company will substantially comply with such formal request as soon as reasonably practicable, unless otherwise agreed between Parent
and the Company. Neither Parent nor the Company shall agree, directly or indirectly, to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable
Law or to any timing agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity, without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

matters that are the subject of this Agreement and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, furnish the other party promptly with all communications
received from any Governmental Entity and permit the other party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the other party’s comments to, any
proposed communication, filing or submission by such party to any Governmental Entity. The parties will coordinate and reasonably cooperate with each
other in exchanging information and providing reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in writing in connection with the
foregoing or in connection with any filing or submission to be made to any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that materials exchanged pursuant
to this Section 7.1 may be redacted or withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns, and to remove references concerning the
valuation of Parent’s or the Company’s consideration of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other competitively sensitive material;
provided, further that the parties hereto may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any materials provided to the other pursuant to this
Section 7.1 as “outside counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party
providing such materials. Parent and the Company shall (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) consult with the other party in advance of any
meeting, discussion or teleconference with any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with any other person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Entity or such other person,
give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings, discussions and teleconferences. The parties shall discuss in advance
the strategy and timing for obtaining any clearances required or advisable under any applicable Law in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

behalf of the parties, control and lead (after discussing with the Company and taking the Company’s views into account in good faith) all communications
and strategy for dealing with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Competition Law that may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent shall, on behalf of
the parties, control and lead (after discussing with the Company and taking the Company’s views into account in good faith) the defense strategy for
dealing with all Proceedings challenging the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are brought by the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Competition Law.
(f) Parent shall not, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, acquire
or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing part or all of the assets of or equity of, in any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof, or take any other similar action, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the taking of any other similar action, would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders,
clearances or approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or
 
A-50
Table of Contents
termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase, in any material respect, the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk, in any material respect, of not being able to remove any such order on

operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries prior to the Corporate Merger
Effective Time. Prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other Representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and
records, and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party
all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest,
joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.
(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party’s Subsidiaries or
Representatives pursuant to Section 7.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, by and between the Company and Parent, dated December 17, 2020 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).
(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the other set forth herein.
7.3 Parent Meeting.
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and no later than forty-five (45) days following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare, in consultation with the Company, and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning itself and its affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in such
filings prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments (written or oral) of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall promptly notify the Company upon
the receipt of any comments (written or oral) from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement. Parent shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating them to Parent’s stockholders and a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional information, and shall consider
 
A-51
Table of Contents
any comments proposed by the Company in good faith. Parent will cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to Parent’s stockholders as promptly
as practicable, and in no event more than five (5) business days, after the later of (i) the expiration of the ten (10)-day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-
6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) the date on which Parent learns the SEC staff has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. If, at any
time prior to the Parent Meeting, any information relating to the Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall
not contain any untrue statement of any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties and correct such information, and Parent shall file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information with the SEC. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or “Blue Sky” permits and
approvals required under Delaware law to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of shares of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.
(b) Parent shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the “Parent Meeting”) to be held as promptly as practicable, and
in no event more than forty-five (45) days after the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or the date on which Parent learns the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, for the purpose of obtaining (a) the Requisite Parent Vote
and the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers and (b) if so desired and mutually
agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of stockholders in connection with the approval of a merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Subject to Section 7.3(c), Parent and its Board of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the Parent stockholders the Requisite Parent Vote and the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment Vote, including by communicating to
the Parent stockholders the Parent Board Recommendation (and including the Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement), and Parent and its
Board of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the Company the Parent Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to
make the Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly
announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend
against any Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as
remains prior that date that is two (2) business days prior to the Parent Meeting) after an Acquisition Proposal is made public, or (v) publicly propose to
do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing, a “Recommendation Change”).
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 9.1 and Section 9.2, if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consulting
with such outside advisors as it determines in good faith to be reasonably necessary consistent with its fiduciary duties, that taking such action would
be required to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Parent may, in connection with a Superior Proposal or in
response to an Intervening Event, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, make a Recommendation Change; provided that the Board of Directors
of Parent may not take any actions under this sentence unless it (A) gives the Company at least four (4) business days’ prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, in
the event such action is taken in response to a Superior Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such
Superior Proposal, or any (1) amendment or modification to the economic terms thereof or (2) other material amendment or modification to the terms
thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (B) at the end of such notice period, takes into account any amendment
or modification to this Agreement proposed by the Company and determines in good faith, after consulting with such outside advisors as it determines in
good faith to be reasonably necessary consistent with its fiduciary duties, that taking such action would nevertheless be required to comply with its
 
A-52
Table of Contents
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any change in the economic terms of or any other material amendment to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to
be a new Superior Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 7.3 (except that the notice
period shall be shortened to two (2) business days).
(d) If at any time following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement, the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the Requisite Parent Vote is
unlikely to be obtained at the Parent Meeting, including due to an absence of quorum, then the Company shall have the right to require an adjournment
or postponement of the Parent Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company
may only require an adjournment or postponement of the Parent Meeting one time (and not multiple times), and such adjournment or postponement shall
not delay the Parent Meeting by more than seven (7) days from the prior-scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) business day preceding the
Termination Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Meeting if (i) there are holders of an
insufficient number of shares present or represented by proxy at the Parent Meeting to constitute a quorum, (ii) Parent determines in good faith that it
must solicit additional votes to obtain the Requisite Parent Vote or (iii) Parent is required to postpone or adjourn the Parent Meeting by applicable Law (as
determined by Parent in good faith) or a request from the SEC or its staff; provided that no such adjournment or postponement shall delay the Parent
Meeting by more than seven (7) days from the prior-scheduled date (after giving effect to any prior adjournment or postponement) or to a date on or after
the fifth (5th) business day preceding the Termination Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Parent Meeting shall be
convened and the Share Issuance, the Authorized Share Charter Amendment and the Corporate Opportunity Charter Amendment shall be submitted to
the stockholders of Parent at the Parent Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Parent of such obligation, including as a result
of a Recommendation Change.
7.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 7.1 of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly
with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Mergers and, subject to the conditions set forth in
Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to make any payment to a third party (other than a Governmental Entity)
or incur any liability to a third party (other than a Governmental Entity) to obtain any such consent, authorization, order, approval or exemption.
7.5 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Corporate Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time.
7.6 Employee Benefit Plans.
(a) In order to further an orderly transition and integration, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing
the Company Benefit Plans and Parent Benefit Plans with a view towards developing appropriate new benefit plans, or selecting the Company Benefit
Plans or Parent Benefit Plans, as applicable, that will apply with respect to employees of the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries after the Corporate
Merger Effective Time (collectively, the “New Benefit Plans”), provided, however, that prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, Parent, and after the
Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Combined Company, shall have the ultimate authority with respect to all decisions relating to New
 
A-53
Table of Contents
Benefit Plans, and the Combined Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the New Benefit Plans, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, to (i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties,
geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, and (ii) not discriminate between employees who were covered by Company Benefit Plans, on the
one hand, and those covered by Parent Benefit Plans, on the other hand, at the Corporate Merger Effective Time. During the six (6) month period
immediately following the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Combined Company or its Subsidiaries shall provide each employee of Company and
each employee of the Parent (and their respective Subsidiaries) who remains employed by the Combined Company or its Subsidiaries (each such
employee, a “Legacy Employee”), with (i) an annual base salary or wage rate and (ii) severance benefits in the event that such Legacy Employee
experiences a qualifying termination of employment during the six (6) month period immediately following the Corporate Merger Effective Time, that are
no less favorable, in each case, than the greater of (A) such Legacy Employee’s salary or wage rate, as applicable, and severance entitlement as of
immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time and (B) the salary or wage rate, as applicable, and severance entitlement in effect for similarly
situated employees of the Combined Company or its Subsidiaries. Until such time as the New Benefit Plans are determined and/or established, each
Legacy Employee who was employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time will participate in Parent
Benefit Plans until the earlier of (i) the time as the New Benefit Plans are determined and/or established and (ii) the date that is six (6) months following the
Corporate Merger Effective Time, and each Legacy Employee who was employed by Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Corporate
Merger Effective Time will participate in Company Benefit Plans, in each case subject to such Legacy Employee’s continued employment with the
Combined Company and its Subsidiaries and the terms of such plans, including eligibility. It is understood and agreed that participation in New Benefit
Plans may commence on different dates following the Corporate Merger Effective Time for different plans.
(b) With respect to any New Benefit Plans in which any Legacy Employees first become eligible to participate on or after the Corporate Merger Effective
Time, and in which such Legacy Employee did not participate prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Combined Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Legacy Employee and their eligible dependents under any New Benefit Plans in which such Legacy Employee first
become eligible to participate after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, except to the extent such preexisting conditions, exclusions or waiting periods
would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, as the case may be, (ii) provide each such Legacy Employee and his or
her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time (or, if later, prior to the time
such Legacy Employee commenced participation in the New Benefit Plan) under a Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Benefit Plans in which such Legacy Employees first become eligible to participate after the Corporate Merger Effective Time,
and (iii) recognize all service of such Legacy Employees with the Company or Parent, as applicable, and their respective Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities), for all purposes in any New Benefit Plan in which such Legacy Employees first become eligible to participate after the Corporate
Merger Effective Time to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan prior
to the Corporate Merger Effective Time; provided that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits for the same period of service, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (C) for purposes of any benefit plan
that provides retiree welfare benefits, (D) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits, or (E) to the extent it would require
any retroactive contributions.
(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Entity, the Combined Company, Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof, or shall
 
A-54
Table of Contents
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Entity, the Combined Company, Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof
to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Parent
Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (or, after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Combined Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or their
respective affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Corporate Merger Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 10.11, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.
7.7 Certain Tax Matters.
(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers, taken together, to qualify, and shall not take (and shall
cause its affiliates not to take) any action that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company shall not knowingly fail to take (and shall cause its
affiliates not knowingly to fail to take) any action that could reasonably be expected to be necessary to permit the Mergers, taken together, to so qualify.
(b) If the Company or Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P. has requested an opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Company Tax Counsel”), dated as of the
Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, the Mergers, taken together, will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (a “Reorganization Tax
Opinion”), each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall cooperate with one another to obtain the Reorganization Tax Opinion. In
connection with the foregoing, (i) Parent shall (and shall cause each of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to) deliver to Company Tax Counsel a duly
executed letter of representation, substantially in the form of Exhibit G (the “Parent Tax Certificate”), and (ii) the Company shall deliver to Company Tax
Counsel a duly executed letter of representation, substantially in the form of Exhibit H (the “Company Tax Certificate”), in the case of each of clause
(i) and (ii), at such times as such counsel shall reasonably request (including at the Closing). Parent and the Company shall also provide such other
information as reasonably requested by Company Tax Counsel for purposes of rendering any opinion described in this Section 7.7(b).
(c) Parent shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date (“Pre-Closing Tax Period”) until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and shall abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority. With respect to matters pertaining to any and all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Parent will furnish to Tiger Parent
Holdings, L.P. any information and other reasonable assistance requested by Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P. in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or
any proceeding, examination, investigation, audit or review by a Governmental Entity with respect to Taxes.
(d) Prior to the Closing, Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P., the Company’s sole stockholder, shall deliver to Parent a properly completed and duly executed IRS
Form W-9, it being agreed and understood that Parent’s sole remedy for breach of this Section 7.7(d) shall be to withhold the amounts required to be
withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code.
(e) It is agreed and understood that the provisions of this Section 7.7 (other than Section 7.7(d)) are for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, Tiger
Parent Holdings, L.P.

7.8 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.
(a) From and after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Combined Company shall indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as
incurred, in each case to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such persons that are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Company or of any Company Subsidiary and any indemnification agreements in existence as
of the date hereof and disclosed in Section 7.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the
“Company Indemnified Parties”) and such persons that are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of Parent or of any Parent Subsidiary and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof and disclosed in Section 7.8(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Parent Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened in writing or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Corporate
Merger Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses, any Company Indemnified Party or Parent
Indemnified Party, to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification.
(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Combined Company shall cause to be maintained in effect insurance
coverage equivalent to the coverage under the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date
hereof (provided, that the Combined Company may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
at or before the Corporate Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that the Combined Company shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis,
an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if
such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Combined Company shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance which, in the Combined Company’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may, or at Parent’s request shall, obtain at or prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time a six (6)-
year “tail” policy under the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding
sentence if the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.
(c) The provisions of this Section 7.8 shall survive the Corporate Merger Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives. If the Combined Company, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in each such case, the Combined
Company or the Surviving Entity will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Combined Company or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable, will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8.
7.9 Stockholder Litigation. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any stockholder litigation against Parent or its directors or officers relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall give the Company the opportunity to participate (at the Company’s expense) in the defense
or settlement of any such litigation. Parent shall give the Company the right to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by such party
in connection with any such litigation, and will in good faith take such comments into
 
A-56
Table of Contents
account. Parent shall not agree to settle any such litigation in which the Company, Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P., Apollo Global Management, Inc. or any of
their respective affiliates are named without the Company’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that Parent shall not agree to settle any other such litigation without first consulting in good faith with the Company and, following
such good faith consultation, may agree to settle such litigation without the prior written consent of the Company to the extent that such settlement
would not impose any material restriction on, or create any adverse precedent that would be material to, the business of the Combined Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Mergers and would not impose any restrictions on the Company, Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P.,
Apollo Global Management, Inc. or their respective affiliates, as applicable.
7.10 Acquisition Proposals.
(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers not to, and shall not permit
its and their other respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or
proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with any person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent,
commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (whether written or oral,
binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 7.10) in connection with or
relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Each party will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent or the Company, as applicable, with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, and request the return or destruction of any confidential information previously delivered to any such person pursuant to
the terms of any confidentiality agreement to the extent provided by such agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.10(a), in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, Parent receives
a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 7.10, Parent may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal and Parent’s Representatives if the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in good faith,
after consulting with such outside advisors as it determines in good faith to be reasonably necessary consistent with its fiduciary duties, that taking such
actions would be required to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that, prior to furnishing any confidential or nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, Parent shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such
Acquisition Proposal on terms substantially no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Parent, and shall otherwise permit Parent to comply with its obligations herein.
(c) Parent will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise the Company following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the
person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide the Company with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition Proposal and any draft
agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the Company apprised of
any related material developments, discussions and negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including any (1) amendment or modification to the
economic terms thereof or (2) other material amendment or modification to the terms thereof. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce
any confidentiality agreements (other than “standstill” provisions therein) to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes a party in accordance with
the terms thereof. Parent shall not, and shall not
 
A-57
Table of Contents
permit any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to, enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which
prohibits Parent from providing to the Company the information required to be provided to the Company pursuant to this Section 7.10(c).
(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Parent or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to
such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.
7.11 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company agree that the initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties agrees that, without limiting Section 7.3, no public release or
announcement or other public statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, (b) for such releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such releases, announcements or
statements made after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this Section 7.11, or (c) for releases, announcements or statements made in
connection with a Recommendation Change or in connection with litigation between the parties.
7.12 Takeover Statutes. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would
cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement or the Mergers, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the Mergers from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the Mergers, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on the Mergers, including, if
necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.
7.13 Financing Matters.
(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing in an amount (together with any other cash sources available to Parent
and its Subsidiaries) sufficient to satisfy the Transaction Uses on the terms (including the “market flex” provisions) and subject only to the conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related to the Financing (the “Financing Agreements”), including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect, until the Closing Date, the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, as applicable, (ii) materially comply with the
obligations that are set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements that are applicable to Parent (insofar as failure to so comply would
constitute an unsatisfied condition precedent to obtaining the Financing or give rise to a termination right under the Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreements) and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent in the Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements that are within its control,
and (iii) to the extent necessary to satisfy the Transaction Uses, fully enforce the rights of Parent under the Commitment Letter and the Financing
Agreements. Parent shall not prior to the Closing release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the Commitment Letter or
the Financing Agreements without the consent of the Company (other than in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date of this Agreement).
 
A-58
Table of Contents
(b) In the event any funds required to satisfy the Transaction Uses, or any portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Commitment Letter (if applicable, after giving effect to the “market flex” provisions) or the Financing Agreements, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to arrange to obtain promptly any such portion from the same or alternative sources, in an
amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available, to allow Parent to satisfy the Transaction Uses (the “Alternative
Financing”), and to obtain a new financing commitment to Parent that provides for such Alternative Financing on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to each of Parent and the Company (the “Alternative Financing Commitment Letter”). It is understood and agreed that (i) committed
Permanent Financing may reduce (dollar-for-dollar) the Financing and such shall not be a breach of this Section 7.13(b) so long as the net proceeds of
such Permanent Financing are made available to fund the Transaction Uses on the Closing Date and (ii) the terms and conditions of any Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter that provides for Alternative Financing on terms not materially less favorable to Parent (taking into account the “market
flex” provisions set forth in the Commitment Letter) shall be deemed to reasonably acceptable to the Company for purposes of the preceding sentence so
long as such terms and conditions would not have any result, event or consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (D) of Section 7.13(c).
(c) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice upon it obtaining knowledge of (i) any material breach (or threatened in writing material breach)
or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material
breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, (ii) any actual or threatened in writing withdrawal, repudiation or
termination of the Financing by any of the lenders, (iii) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the Financing Parties (on the one
hand) and Parent or any of its affiliates (on the other hand) party to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, and (iv) any amendment or
modification of, or waiver under, the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
amend, modify, supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any waiver under the Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement,

and such denial has become final and nonappealable or (ii) any Law or order issued after the date of this Agreement permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers shall have become final and non-appealable, unless the denial of such Requisite Regulatory
Approval or issuance of such Law or order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers, as applicable,
shall be principally due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein;

constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.2, in the case of a termination by the Company,
or Section 8.3, in the case of a termination by Parent, and which is not cured within thirty (30) days (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination
Date) following written notice to Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or by its
nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);
(e) by either Parent or the Company if the Requisite Parent Vote shall not have been obtained following a vote taken at the Parent Meeting (unless such

A-67
Table of Contents
the obligations of Parent set forth in Section 7.10(a) or Section 7.10(c), be deemed, solely in and of itself, to trigger the Company’s termination right under
Section 9.1(f) (it being understood that facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such breach or Willful Breach may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Willful Breach of the obligations under Section 7.10(a) or Section 7.10(c)); and (ii) any notice (including advising or
keeping apprised) or delivery upon the Company as required under Section 7.10(c) shall be deemed effective if such notice or delivery is given in
accordance with Section 10.5.
9.2 Effect of Termination.
(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors or any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 7.2(b), Section 7.11, this
Section 9.2 and Article X shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its Willful Breach of any provision of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “Willful Breach” means, with respect to any party, a material breach or failure to perform that is the
consequence of an act or omission of such party with the knowledge that such act or omission would cause a material breach of this Agreement.
(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(e) then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire
transfer, a cash amount equal to the aggregate amount of all reasonable fees, costs and other expenses directly related to the Mergers incurred by the
Company or its affiliates (the “Company Expenses”).
(c) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been
communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Parent or shall have been made publicly to the
stockholders of Parent or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the Parent Meeting) an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to Parent and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d) or
either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(e) and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Parent
consummates or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred
to above), and actually consummates the transaction with respect to such Acquisition Proposal thereafter, then Parent shall, on the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay the Company, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to: (x) $131,683,200, if the earlier of (1) Parent
consummating the Acquisition Proposal or (2) Parent entering into the definitive agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal occurs prior to the
date that is six (6) months after the date of termination; (y) $86,275,200, if the earlier of (1) Parent consummating the Acquisition Proposal or (2) Parent
entering into the definitive agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal occurs after the date that is six (6) months after the date of termination and
prior to the date that is nine (9) months after the date of termination; or (z) $40,867,200, if the earlier of (1) Parent consummating the Acquisition Proposal
or (2) Parent entering into the definitive agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal occurs after the date that is nine (9) months after the date of
termination and prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of termination (such applicable amount, the “Tail Termination Fee”) (in the case
of termination by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(e), without duplication of the amount of Company Expenses actually paid by Parent);
provided, that for purposes of this Section 9.2(c)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “twenty percent (20%)” and “eighty percent
(80%)” shall instead refer to “fifty percent (50%).”
(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(f) or by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(g) then Parent shall pay
the Company, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to $131,683,200 (the “Termination Fee”) within two (2) business days of the date of
termination.

(d) Except in the case of a Willful Breach by Parent which shall be subject to Section 9.2(a), following the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the payment of the Tail Termination Fee, Termination Fee and/or the Company Expenses, as applicable, by Parent, in circumstances in
which they are due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9.2(d) in connection therewith,
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise) of the Company against Parent and the Financing Parties and any of
their respective affiliates and any of their respective current or former Representatives relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein (including for any breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without
limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages to the extent permitted herein, in no event shall Parent be required to pay both the Tail
Termination Fee and the Termination Fee, or either of such fees more than once. Except in the case of a Willful Breach by the Company which shall be
subject to Section 9.2(a), following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent,
Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 9.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee, as applicable, or any portion thereof,
such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit. In addition, if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9.2, then such party shall pay
interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” published in the Wall Street Journal on the date on which such payment
was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date
that such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

10.6 Interpretation. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring

Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words “without limitation.” The word “or” shall not be exclusive. References to “the date hereof” shall mean the date of this Agreement.

effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign
the same counterpart.
10.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) together with the Investor Rights Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Clean Team Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
10.9 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.
(a) This Agreement, the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause
of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of

A-71
Table of Contents
(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the State
of Delaware (the “Chosen Courts”), and, solely in connection with the Delaware Claims, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective upon personal service or 10 days after notice is given by both email and express courier (with confirmation) as provided by
Section 10.5 including a courtesy copy (by email) to all counsel.
10.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION,
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE FINANCING OR ANY
PERMANENT FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

10.11 Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party (which may be withheld by such other
party in its sole discretion). Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, each of Parent and Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation may assign any of its rights, but
not its obligations, under this Agreement to any of the Financing Parties as collateral security. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 7.7
and Section 7.8 this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In
some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other
date.
10.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which money damages would not be sufficient relief, would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened in writing breaches of
 
A-72
Table of Contents
this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties’ obligation to consummate the
Mergers), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of its affiliates be entitled to seek the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement directly against any Financing Entity; provided that nothing in this Section 10.12 shall in any way limit
or modify the obligations of any Financing Entity to Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II under the Commitment Letter.
10.13 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or
portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
10.14 Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a “.pdf” format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a “.pdf”
format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
10.15 Financing Entities. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company, on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and each of its
controlled affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing
Entities, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing, any Permanent Financing or any of the agreements (including any applicable
commitment letter) entered into in connection with the Financing, any Permanent Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees that any such action shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the
laws of another state), except as otherwise provided in any applicable commitment letter, agreement or document relating to the Financing or any
Permanent Financing, (c) agrees not to bring or support or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its affiliates to bring or support any action of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Entity in any way arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Financing, any Permanent Financing, any commitment letter relating thereto or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, (d) agrees that service of process upon the Company, its Subsidiaries and its controlled affiliates in any such action shall be effective if
notice is given in accordance with Section 10.5, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action in any such court, (f) KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT AGAINST THE

ANY COMMITMENT LETTER RELATING THERETO OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE
PERFORMANCE OF ANY SERVICES THEREUNDER, (g) agrees that none of the Financing Entities will have any liability to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of its controlled affiliates or Representatives (in each case, other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing, any Permanent Financing, any commitment letter relating thereto or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise; provided, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.15(g) shall in any way limit or modify the obligations of any Financing Entity to Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub
II under the Commitment Letter and (h) agrees that (and each other party hereto agrees that) the Financing Entities are express third party beneficiaries of,
and may enforce, any of the provisions of this Section 10.15, and that such provisions and the definitions of “Financing Entities” and “Financing Parties”

below) may serve as directors, officers or agents of the Corporation and its Affiliates, and (ii) the Apollo Entities and their respective Affiliates may
now engage and may continue to engage in the same or similar activities or related lines of business as those in which the Corporation and
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other business activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation and
its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, may engage, the provisions of this Article XI are set forth to regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of
the Corporation and its Affiliates with respect to certain classes or categories of business opportunities as they may involve the Apollo Entities
and their respective Affiliates and any person or entity who, while a stockholder, director, officer or agent of the Corporation or any of its Affiliates,
is a director, officer, principal, partner, member, manager, employee, agent and/or other representative of the Apollo Entities and their respective
Affiliates (each, an “Identified Person”), on the one hand, and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the Corporation and its Affiliates and its
and their respective stockholders, directors, officers, and agents in connection therewith, on the other. To the fullest extent permitted by law
(including, without limitation, the Delaware General Corporation Law), each Identified Person (i) shall have the right to, directly or indirectly, engage
in and possess interests in other business ventures of every type and description, including those engaged in the same or similar business
activities or lines of business as the Corporation or any of its Affiliates or deemed to be competing with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates,
whether on its own account or as a partner, equity holder, controlling person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate (including any
portfolio company), member, financing source, investor, manager, or assignee of any other person or entity, with no obligation to offer to
Table of Contents
the Corporation or its subsidiaries or other Affiliates the right to participate therein and (ii) shall have the right to invest in, or provide services to,
any person that is engaged in the same or similar business activities as the Corporation or its Affiliates or that directly or indirectly competes with
the Corporation or any of its Affiliates.
B. Competitive Opportunities. In the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be an
investment, corporate or business opportunity or prospective economic or competitive advantage in which the Corporation or its Affiliates could
have an interest or expectancy (contractual, equitable or otherwise) (a “Competitive Opportunity”) or otherwise is then exploiting any Competitive
Opportunity, to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Corporation and its Affiliates will have no interest in,
and no expectation that such Competitive Opportunity be offered to it, except as may be otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation and
the Apollo Entities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any such interest or expectation (contractual, equitable or otherwise) is hereby
renounced so that such Identified Person shall (i) have no duty to communicate or present such Competitive Opportunity to the Corporation or its
Affiliates, (ii) have the right to either hold any such Competitive Opportunity for such Identified Person’s own account and benefit or the account
of the Apollo Entities and their respective Affiliates or Identified Person’s Affiliates or to direct, recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such
Competitive Opportunity to persons or entities other than the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, Affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders
and (iii) notwithstanding any provision in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to the contrary, not be obligated or liable to the
Corporation, any stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation or any other person or entity by reason of the fact that such Identified Person,
directly or indirectly, took any of the actions noted in the immediately preceding clause (ii), pursued or acquired such Competitive Opportunity for
itself or any other person or entity or failed to communicate or present such Competitive Opportunity to the Corporation or its Affiliates.
C. Acknowledgement. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any shares of capital stock of the
Corporation or any other interest in the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Article XI.
D. Interpretation; Duties. In the event of a conflict or other inconsistency between this Article XI and any other Article or provision of this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, this Article XI shall prevail under all circumstances. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, under no circumstances shall (i) an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries be deemed to be an “Identified Person”, and
(ii) the Corporation be deemed to have waived or renounced any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered any opportunity
to participate in, any Competitive Opportunity that is presented to an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, irrespective of
whether such employee (a) is a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or their respective affiliates or (b) otherwise would be
an Identified Person absent being an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.
E. Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to paragraph D of this Article XI, this Article XI is
intended to constitute, with respect to the Identified Persons, a disclaimer and renunciation, to the fullest extent permitted under Section 122(17) of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, of any right of the Corporation or any of its Affiliates with respect to the matters set forth in this Article XI,
and this Article XI shall be construed to effect such disclaimer and renunciation to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General
Corporation Law.
F. Definitions. Solely for purposes of this Article XI, “Affiliate” shall mean (i) with respect to the Apollo Entities, any person or entity that, directly
or indirectly, is controlled by an Apollo Entity, controls an Apollo Entity, or is under common control with an Apollo Entity, but excluding (a) the
Corporation, and (b) any entity that is controlled by the Corporation (including its direct and indirect subsidiaries), and (ii) in respect of the
Corporation, any person or entity that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by the Corporation; and “Apollo Entities” shall mean, collectively, Apollo

ARTICLE XI
Offices
11.1 Principal Office. The registered office of the corporation shall be 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, and the name of the registered
agent in charge thereof is The Corporation Trust Company.
11.2 Additional Offices. The corporation may also have offices at such other places, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors (the “Board”) may from time to time designate or the business of the corporation may require.
ARTICLE XII
Meeting of Stockholders
12.1 Place of Meeting. Meetings of stockholders may be held at such place, either within or without of the State of Delaware, as may be designated by or
in the manner provided in these Bylaws, or, if not so designated, at the registered office of the corporation or the principal executive offices of the
corporation.
12.2 Annual Meeting. Annual meetings of stockholders shall be held each year at such date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the
Board or the Chief Executive Officer or Co-Chief Executive Officer (in the event there are two or more Co-Chief Executive Officers, each a “Chief Executive
Officer”) and stated in the notice of the meeting. At such annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect by a plurality vote a Board of Directors. The
stockholders shall also transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meetings.
To be properly brought before the annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record. In addition to any other
applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice
thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered personally or deposited in the United States
mail, or delivered to a common carrier for transmission to the recipient or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means to the
recipient or sent by other means of written communication, postage or delivery charges prepaid in all such cases, and received at the principal executive
offices of the corporation, addressed to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation, not less than fifty (50) days nor more than seventy-five
(75) days prior to the scheduled date of the meeting (regardless of any postponements, deferrals or adjournments of that meeting to a later date);
provided, however, that in the event that less than sixty-five (65) days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the scheduled meeting is given or
made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the earlier of (a) the close of business on the 15th day
following the day on which such notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure
Table of Contents
was made, whichever first occurs, and (b) two (2) days prior to the date of the scheduled meeting. A stockholder’s notice to the Secretary shall set forth
as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such
business, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially by the stockholder, and (iv) any material interest of the
stockholder in such business.
Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any
business properly brought before the annual meeting.
The Chairman of the Board of the corporation (or such other person presiding at the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws) shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section, and if
he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
12.3 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by the Chief Executive Officer or Secretary only at the request of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or by a
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed
meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting.
12.4 Notice of Meetings. Written notice of stockholders’ meetings, stating the place, date and time of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes for which such special meeting is called, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting.
When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date and time thereof
are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty
(30) days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place,
date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the original meeting.
12.5 Business Matter of a Special Meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the
notice, except to the extent such notice is waived or is not required.
12.6 List of Stockholders. The officer in charge of the stock ledger of the corporation or the transfer agent shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days
before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, at a place
within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place, if other than the place of the meeting, shall be specified in the notice of the meeting. The list
shall also be produced and kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present in
person thereat.
12.7 Organization and Conduct of Business. The Chairman of the Board or, in his or her absence, the Chief Executive Officer or President of the
corporation or, in their absence, such person as the Board may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, such person as may be chosen by
the holders of a majority of the
 
-5-
Table of Contents
shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as Chairman of the meeting. In
the absence of the Secretary of the corporation, the Secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the Chairman appoints.
The Chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the
manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her in order.
12.8 Quorum and Adjournments. Except where otherwise provided by law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the holders of a
majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented in proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders. The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to have less than a quorum if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a
majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If, however, a quorum shall not be present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat who are present in person or represented by proxy shall have the power to adjourn
the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.
12.9 Voting Rights. Unless otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be
entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder.
12.10 Majority Vote. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes
or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a different vote is required in which case such express provision shall govern and
control the decision of such question.
12.11 Record Date for Stockholder Notice and Voting. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or
any adjournment thereof, or to vote, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, or entitled to exercise any right in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be
more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any other action. If the
Board does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at
the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business
day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
12.12 Proxies. Every person entitled to vote for directors or on any other matter shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents
authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the Secretary of the corporation. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder’s
name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, electronic transmission or otherwise) by the
stockholder or the stockholder’s attorney-in-fact. A validly executed proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect
unless (i) revoked by the person executing it, before the vote pursuant to that proxy, by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is
revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy; or (ii) written notice
of the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is received by the corporation before the vote pursuant to that proxy is counted; provided, however,
that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of three (3) years from the date of the proxy, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
 
-6-
Table of Contents
12.13 Inspectors of Election. The corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the
meeting and make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or more persons to act as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector
who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute
the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.
12.14 Action Without a Meeting. No action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the corporation may
be taken without a meeting and the power of the stockholders to consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied.
ARTICLE XIII
Directors
13.1 Number, Election, Tenure and Qualifications. Subject to the rights of any stockholder as set forth in any agreement with the corporation, including
the Investor Rights Agreement, dated [•], by and between the corporation and Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P. (as it may be amended or supplemented from
time to time) (any such agreement, an “Investor/Company Agreement”), the number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall
be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors or stockholders at the annual meeting or any special meeting called for that purpose. The
classes of directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be as provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
At each annual meeting of the stockholders, directors shall be elected for that class of directors whose terms are expiring, except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.2 of this Article, and each director so elected shall hold office until such director’s successor is duly elected and qualified or until such
director’s earlier resignation.
Subject to the rights of any stockholders pursuant to any Investor/Company Agreement or the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a
preference over the common stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors at the annual
meeting, by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, may be made by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board of Directors;
nominations may also be made by any stockholder of record of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies
with the notice procedures set forth in this Section. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be
made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered personally or
deposited in the United States mail, or delivered to a common carrier for transmission to the recipient or actually transmitted by the person giving the
notice by electronic means to the recipient or sent by other means of written communication, postage or delivery charges prepaid in all such cases, and
received at the principal executive offices of the corporation addressed to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation not less than one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to the scheduled date of the meeting (regardless of any postponements, deferrals or adjournments of that meeting to a later date);
provided, however, that, in the case of an annual meeting and in the event that less than one hundred (100) days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the
date of the scheduled meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the 7th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the scheduled meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made,
whichever first occurs. Such stockholder’s notice to the Secretary shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
election or reelection as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of
the person, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that are owned beneficially by the person, (iv) a statement as to
the person’s citizenship, and (v) any other information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of
directors pursuant
 
-7-
Table of Contents
to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder
giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of the stockholder and (ii) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that
are owned beneficially by the stockholder. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be
required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as director of the corporation. No person shall be eligible for
election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein or pursuant to the terms of any
Investor/Company Agreement that otherwise provides stockholders with specific rights with respect to nominating persons to serves as directors.
In connection with any annual meeting, the Chairman of the Board of Directors (or such other person presiding at such meeting in accordance with these
Bylaws) shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and
if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
Directors shall serve as provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation. Directors need not be stockholders.
13.2 Enlargement and Vacancies. The number of members of the Board of Directors may be increased at any time by vote of a majority of the directors
then in office. Subject to the terms of any Investor/Company Agreement, sole power to fill vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors shall be vested in the Board of Directors through action by a majority of the directors then in office, though
less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and each director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election at which the term of the
class to which they have been elected expires and until such director’s successor is duly elected and qualified or until such director’s earlier resignation,
removal from office, death or incapacity. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. In
the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law, these by-laws, or any Investor/Company
Agreement, may exercise the powers of the full board until the vacancy is filled.
13.3 Resignation and Removal. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation at its principal place of business or to the Chief
Executive Officer or the Secretary. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt of such notice unless the notice specifies such resignation to be
effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other event. Any director or the entire Board may be removed, with or without cause, by the
holders of at least a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, unless otherwise specified by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation.
13.4 Powers. The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board which may exercise all such powers of the
corporation and do all such lawful acts and things which are not by statute or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or
required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
13.5 Chairman of the Board. If the Board of Directors appoints a Chairman of the Board, such Chairman shall, when present, preside at all meetings of the
stockholders and the Board. The Chairman shall perform such duties and possess such powers as are customarily vested in the office of the Chairman of
the Board or as may be vested in the Chairman by the Board of Directors.
13.6 Place of Meetings. The Board may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.

Table of Contents
13.7 Annual Meetings. The annual meetings of the Board shall be held immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders, and no notice of such
meeting shall be necessary to the Board, provided a quorum shall be present. The annual meetings shall be for the purposes of organization, and an
election of officers and the transaction of other business.

committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or of any committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or similar

constitute presence in person at the meeting.

corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for
attending committee meetings.

records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the

ARTICLE XVI
Indemnification
16.1 Actions Other Than By or in the Right of the Corporation. The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an
action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys
 
-12-
Table of Contents
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct
was unlawful.
16.2 Actions By or in the Right of the Corporation. The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner
such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of
such person’s duty to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action
or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall
deem proper.
16.3 Success on the Merits. To the extent that any person described in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 of this Article 6 has been successful on the merits or otherwise
in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in said Sections, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
16.4 Specific Authorization. Any indemnification under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 of this Article 6 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation
only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of any person described in said Sections is proper in the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said Sections. Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of the
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors,
even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or
(4) by the stockholders of the corporation.
16.5 Advance Payment. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the manner provided for in Section 6.4 of this Article 6 upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of any person described in said Section to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is entitled to indemnification by the corporation as authorized in this Article 6.
16.6 Non-Exclusivity. The indemnification provided by this Article 6 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and
as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be director, officer,
 
-13-
Table of Contents
employee or agent of the corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Any repeal or amendment
of any of the provisions of this Article 6 shall not adversely affect any right or potential right of any indemnitee existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment.
16.7 Insurance. The Board of Directors may authorize, by a vote of the majority of the full board, the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such
person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article 6.
16.8 Severability. If any word, clause or provision of this Article 6 or any award made hereunder shall for any reason be determined to be invalid, the
provisions hereof shall not otherwise be affected thereby but shall remain in full force and effect.
16.9 Intent of Article. The intent of this Article 6 is to provide for indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware. To the extent that such Section or any successor Section may be amended or supplemented from time to time, this Article 6
shall be amended automatically and construed so as to permit indemnification to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law.

as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal
representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require, and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or have

the board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction or solely because the vote or votes of such director or officer are counted for
such purpose, if:

Section 2    Board of Directors.
(a)    Nomination of Directors. The Apollo Majority shall have the right, but not the obligation, to nominate for election to the Board:
(i)    up to four (4) directors, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 30% of the Outstanding Stock, provided that
at least two (2) of the directors nominated pursuant to this provision shall be “independent” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) American listing standards (or applicable requirements of such other national securities exchange designated as the primary market on
which the Common Stock is then listed for trading) (such independence requirement, the “Independence Requirement” and any Apollo Director
satisfying such Independence Requirement, an “Independent Apollo Director”);
(ii)    up to three (3) directors, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 20% of the Outstanding Stock but less than
30% of the Outstanding Stock, provided that at least one (1) of the directors nominated pursuant to this provision shall be an Independent Apollo
Director;
(iii)    up to two (2) directors, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 10% of the Outstanding Stock but less than
20% of the Outstanding Stock, none of whom shall be required to be an Independent Apollo Director; and
(iv)    up to one (1) director, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 5% of the Outstanding Stock but less than
10% of the Outstanding Stock, who shall not be required to be an Independent Apollo Director.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Board will consist of at least eleven (11) directors and, so long as the restrictions set forth in Section 6 apply, Apollo shall
not be entitled to nominate any directors other than those set forth above. The directors appointed to the Board pursuant to the foregoing clauses
(i) through (iv), together with any replacements to such directors appointed pursuant to Section 2(c) of this Agreement, shall hereinafter be referred to as
the “Apollo Directors”. The initial Apollo Directors shall be mutually acceptable to the Corporation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and any replacement Apollo Directors shall be approved by a majority of the non-Apollo Directors of the Board (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), provided that the Corporation agrees that Matthew Nord and Robert Kalsow-Ramos are
acceptable individuals to serve as Apollo Directors.
In addition to the above, the Parties agree that one director shall be the person then serving as the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation (the “CEO
Director”), who shall initially be, effective upon the closing of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
Richard Hume. In the event that the CEO Director shall cease to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for any reason, the Parties shall
cause (i) the former Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation to be promptly removed from the Board if such person has not resigned as a member of the
Board; and (ii) such person’s replacement as the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation to be appointed as the new CEO Director.
The Board of the Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement shall determine who shall fill the remaining six
(6) director seats (i.e. the non-Apollo Director and the non-CEO Director seats).
In the event the size of the Board is increased or decreased at any time to other than eleven (11) directors, the Apollo Stockholders’ collective nomination
rights under this Section 2(a) shall be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, so that the Board is composed of a number of Apollo
Directors that most closely equals the percentage of the Board originally composed of the Apollo Directors pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iv), rounded up to the nearest whole number. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Apollo elects not to fill a board seat to which it is entitled, the size of the
Board shall be reduced until such time as Apollo determines to fill such seat at which time it shall be correspondingly increased.

(b)    Election of Directors. The Corporation shall take all commercially reasonable action within its power to cause all nominees timely nominated
pursuant to Section 2(a) to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board to the Corporation’s stockholders for election as directors at
each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation (and/or in connection with any election by written consent or at a special meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation), and the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of each such nominee, including
soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such nominees, in each case subject to applicable law (for the avoidance of doubt, the Corporation will be
required to use substantially the same level of efforts and provide substantially the same level of support as is used and/or provided for the other director
nominees of the Corporation with respect to the applicable annual meeting of stockholders or action by written consent in lieu of such meeting). For the
avoidance of doubt, failure of the stockholders of the Corporation to elect any Apollo Director to the Board shall not affect the right of the Apollo
Stockholders to nominate directors for election pursuant to Section 2(a) in any future election of directors.
(c)    Replacement of Directors. In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death, disqualification, resignation, removal or failure to be
elected by the Company stockholders (and no other director has been elected by the stockholders of the Corporation to fill such vacancy) of an Apollo
Director nominated pursuant to Section 2(a), or designated pursuant to this Section 2(c), the Apollo Majority shall have the right to designate a
replacement to fill such vacancy for the Apollo Director consistent with the provisions of Section 2(a) (including being reasonably acceptable to the
Board, excluding the Apollo Directors), and if the Apollo Majority exercises such right, the Board shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
designee to be promptly appointed to the Board to fill such vacancy, subject to applicable law.
(d)    Removal of Directors. Upon the written request of the Apollo Majority seeking to remove and/or replace an Apollo Director nominated pursuant to
Section 2(a), or designated pursuant to Section 2(c), the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such request, including
to promptly call a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call more than a
total of two special meetings with respect to the removal of Apollo Directors.
(e)    Committees. The Board shall determine the composition and make-up of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, and any other committee of the Board.
(f)    Board Leadership. The lead independent director shall be selected by the Board.
(g)    Laws and Regulations. Nothing in this Section 2 shall be deemed to require that any party hereto, or any director of the Corporation, act in violation
of any applicable provision of law, regulation, legal duty or requirement or stock exchange rule.
(h)    Diversity Requirements. So long as any Apollo Directors are required to be Independent Apollo Directors pursuant to this Section 2, Independent
Apollo Directors, and Persons nominated as Independent Apollo Directors pursuant to this Section 2, shall fulfill their pro rata portion (rounded to the
nearest whole number) of any diversity requirements pursuant to law, stock exchange rules or similar regulatory requirements binding on the Corporation
based on the percentage of the Board composed of the Apollo Directors (for example, if Apollo Directors constitute four of eleven members of the Board,
including two Independent Apollo Directors, and the Board is required by applicable law to have a minimum of three female directors, one of the
Independent Apollo Directors would be required to be female); provided that (i) the Apollo Stockholders may elect to satisfy all or part of any such pro
rata allocation with non-Independent Apollo Directors in lieu of Independent Apollo Directors and (ii) once duly elected or appointed, no Apollo Director
shall be required prior to the next annual meeting to resign or be removed from the Board as a result of failing to meet such diversity requirements.

time be in effect, the Corporation agrees that any Apollo Director, any Apollo Entity and any Affiliate or portfolio company thereof (collectively,
“Covered Persons”) may, and shall have no duty not to, (i) invest in, carry on and conduct, whether directly, or as a partner in any partnership, or as a
joint venturer in any joint venture, or as an officer, director, stockholder, equityholder or investor in any person, or as a participant in any syndicate, pool,
trust or association, any business of any kind, nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of
business as the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) do business with any client, customer, vendor or lessor of any of the Corporation or its
Affiliates; and/or (iii) make investments in any kind of property in which the Corporation may make investments. To the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL and subject to any express agreement otherwise that may from time to time be in effect, the Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy to
participate in any business or investments of any Covered Person as currently conducted or as may be conducted in the future, and waives any claim
against a Covered Person arising in connection with or relating to a such Covered Person’s participation in any such business or investment. The
Corporation agrees that, subject to any express agreement otherwise that may from time to time be in effect, in the event that a Covered Person acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may constitute a corporate opportunity for both (x) the Covered Person outside of his or her
capacity as a member of the Board and (y) the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, the Covered Person shall not have any duty to offer or communicate
information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation or its Subsidiaries. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, the Corporation
hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in any potential transaction or matter of which the Covered Person acquires knowledge, except as subject to
any express agreement otherwise that may from time to time be in effect or for any corporate opportunity which is expressly offered to a Covered Person
in writing solely in his or her capacity as a member of the Board, and waives any claim against each Covered Person arising in connection with or relating
to the fact that such Covered Person (A) pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for its own account or the account of any Affiliate or other
person, (B) directs, recommends, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers such corporate opportunity to another person or (C) does not communicate
information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation; provided, that, in each such case, that any corporate opportunity which is
expressly agreed by the Apollo Entities to belong to the Corporation or is expressly offered to a Covered Person in writing solely in his or her capacity as
a member of the Board shall belong to the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under no circumstances shall (i) an employee of
the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries be deemed to be a “Covered Person”, and (ii) the Corporation be deemed to have waived or renounced any
interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered any opportunity to participate in, any corporate, business, or investment opportunity that
is presented to an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, irrespective of whether such employee (a) is a director or officer of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or (b) otherwise would be an Cover Person absent being an employee of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.]1
Section 3    Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. The Corporation shall maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance as determined by the Board. The
Corporation acknowledges and agrees that any Apollo Directors who are partners, members, employees, or consultants of any Apollo Entity may have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by the applicable Apollo Entity (collectively, the “Apollo
Indemnitors”). The Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort with respect to any indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided in the Charter, Bylaws and/or any indemnification agreements to any Apollo Director in his or her
capacity as a director of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (such that the Corporation’s obligations to such indemnitees in their capacities as
directors are primary and any obligation of the Apollo Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification or insurance for the same expenses
or liabilities incurred by such indemnitees are secondary). Such indemnitees shall, in their capacities as directors, be entitled to all the rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and entitled to insurance to the extent provided under (i) Charter and/
 
1 
NTD: To be added if the Corporation’s shareholders fail to approve the corporate opportunity doctrine waiver charter amendment.

or Bylaws in effect from time to time and/or (ii) such other agreement, if any, between the Corporation and such indemnitees, without regard to any rights
such indemnitees may have against the Apollo Indemnitors. No advancement or payment by the Apollo Indemnitors on behalf of such indemnitees with
respect to any claim for which such indemnitees have sought indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance from the Corporation in their
capacities as directors shall affect the foregoing and the Apollo Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such indemnitees against the Corporation.
Section 4    Information.
(a)    For so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 10% of the Outstanding Stock, the Corporation shall, and shall cause its
material Subsidiaries to, permit the Apollo Stockholders and their respective designated representatives, at reasonable times and upon reasonable prior
notice to the Corporation, to inspect, review and/or make copies and extracts from the books and records of the Corporation or any of such material
Subsidiaries and to discuss the affairs, finances and condition of the Corporation or any of such material Subsidiaries with the officers of the Corporation
or any such material Subsidiary, and with respect to matters pertaining to any and all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the Corporation will furnish to the Apollo
Stockholders any information and other reasonable assistance requested by the Apollo Majority in connection with the filing of any Tax Return. For so
long as the Apollo Stockholders beneficially own 10% or more in the aggregate of the Outstanding Stock, upon the written request from any Apollo

the Board who is not an Independent Apollo Director, information in advance with respect to any significant corporate actions, including, without
limitation, extraordinary dividends or distributions, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions of assets, issuances of significant amounts of debt or equity and
material amendments to the Charter or Bylaws or the comparable governing documents of any of its material Subsidiaries, and to provide the Apollo
Stockholders with the right to consult with the Corporation and its material Subsidiaries with respect to such actions, (vi) flash data, in a format to be

end of each quarter and (vii) to the extent otherwise prepared by the Corporation, operating and capital expenditure budgets and periodic information
packages relating to the operations and cash flows of the Corporation and its material Subsidiaries (all such information so furnished pursuant to this
Section 4(a), the “Information”). Subject to Section 4(b), any Apollo Stockholder (and any party receiving Information from such Apollo Stockholder)
who shall receive Information shall maintain the confidentiality of such Information, using the same degree of care that any Apollo Stockholder would
employ with respect to its own most sensitive proprietary, confidential or financial information. The Apollo Stockholders acknowledge and agree that all
of the information received by it in connection with this Agreement is of a confidential nature and may be regarded as material non-public information
under Regulation FD promulgated by the SEC and that such information must be kept confidential by the Apollo Stockholders and not disclosed,
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement does not prohibit any Person from disclosing any information
that constitutes the “tax treatment” or “tax structure” (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(ii)) of any relevant transaction.
The Apollo Stockholders have implemented appropriate measures designed to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws regarding trading in
connection with material non-public information.

other duty of confidentiality to the Corporation; or (iv) is known to, or already in the possession of, an Apollo Entity or its representatives on a non-

is made available to all stockholders of the Corporation, provided, however, that the Apollo Entities may acquire or agree to acquire beneficial
ownership of Voting Securities, including any securities of the Corporation convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Voting Securities, to the
extent that after giving effect to such acquisition, the Apollo Entities would not collectively beneficially own (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the
Exchange Act) more than 45% of the outstanding Voting Securities, excluding any issuance by the Corporation of Voting Securities or options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Voting Securities (or the exercise thereof) to any Apollo Directors or Apollo Entity as compensation for the
membership of the Apollo Directors on the Board, and provided further, that any such acquisition of shares shall not be counted in determining the
rights under Article 2 hereof;
(v)    publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement prohibited by the foregoing; or
(vi)    knowingly instigate, facilitate, encourage or assist any third party to do any of the foregoing;

that (other than as may be a violation of clauses (i) and (ii) above) the right or ability of the Apollo Stockholders to exercise their rights under this
Agreement or the exercise by the Apollo Stockholders of their right to vote shall not, in either case, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of this Section 6.
(b)    The Apollo Entities further agree they shall not, without the prior written consent of the Corporation, publicly request the Corporation to amend or
waive any provision of this Section 6 (including this sentence) or do so in a manner that would require the Corporation to publicly disclose such request.

Corporations’ directors, officers or advisors, so long as such communications are not intended to, and would not reasonably be expected to, require any
public disclosure of such communications.
(c)    This Section 6 shall automatically terminate on the first date following the 90th day, after the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own less
than 5% of the Outstanding Stock. Additionally, in the event that (i) the Corporation engages in, enters into or continues any material discussions or
negotiations regarding any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Change in Control, approves or recommends,
or publicly proposes to approve or recommend, any Change in Control, or enters into a definitive agreement providing for a Change in Control; (ii) any
Person or Group (other than the Apollo Entities) commences a tender offer or exchange offer for securities of the Corporation, which, if consummated,
would result in a Change in Control; (iii) the Board resolves publicly to engage in a formal process that is intended to result in a transaction, which, if
consummated, would result in a Change in Control; or (iv) a Person or Group (other than the Apollo Entities) enters into an agreement or commences a

terminate, effective upon the occurrence of such event.

Stockholder to any Person who is not an Affiliate of an Apollo Stockholder.
Section 9    Rule 144.
The Corporation covenants that so long as the Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b), Section 12(g) or Section 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act, it will file any and all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act (or, if the Corporation is not
required to file such reports, it will make publicly available such necessary information for so long as necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144, Rule
144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act) and that it will take such further action as the Apollo Stockholders may reasonably request, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable the Apollo Stockholders to sell shares of Common Stock without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to
time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.

Section 2.    Registration Rights.
(a)    Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, at any time and from time to time after the date hereof, the Apollo Stockholders may make a written
request (“Registration Request”) to the Corporation for registration under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of all or part of
their Registrable Securities, provided that any Registration Request must be for Registrable Securities with an aggregate dollar value of $100 million or
greater, and the Apollo Stockholders may only make two Registration Requests, written requests for Short Form Registration, or written requests for Shelf
Registration, in the aggregate, in any rolling twelve month period. A Registration Request which does not result in an effective registration under the
Securities Act or a Registration Request that is withdrawn prior to the filing of the requested Registration Statement shall not be counted as a
Registration Request for purposes of the limits in the preceding sentence. All Registration Requests made pursuant to this Section 2 will specify the
aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and will also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof.
(b)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Corporation’s receipt of information from the Apollo Stockholders that is required by
applicable law to be included in such Shelf Registration regarding such Apollo Stockholders, within two Business Days after the Closing Date, the
Corporation shall file an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3ASR covering resales of the Registrable Securities by the Apollo
Stockholders, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective for a period of 3 years following the Closing
Date. In addition, (i) at any time that the Corporation is qualified for the use of Form S-3 promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor form
thereto, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to request in writing registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the Registrable
Securities beneficially owned by any member of the Apollo Stockholders group on Form S-3 (or any successor form) or any similar short form registration
statement, if available (a “Short-Form Registration”) and (ii) at any time, and from time to time, that the initial registration statement on Form S-3ASR or
other shelf registration statements is not in effect or will expire within 90 days, the Apollo Stockholders may request in writing a shelf offering on a
delayed or continuous basis in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act (including the registration statement referred to in the immediately
precedent sentence, a “Shelf Registration”), in which case the provisions of this Section 2(b) shall be applicable, provided that the Apollo Stockholders
may only make two Registration Requests, written requests for Short Form Registration, or written requests for Shelf Registration, in the aggregate, in any
rolling twelve month period. All written requests for Short Form Registration shall (i) specify the aggregate number of Registrable Securities intended to
be sold or disposed of, (ii) state the intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities and (iii) whether or not such Short Form Registration
shall be a Shelf Registration, and upon receipt of such request, the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities so requested to be registered. Any Apollo Stockholder whose Registrable Securities are
included in an effective Shelf Registration (a “Shelf Holder”) may initiate an offering or sale of all or part of such Registrable Securities (a “Shelf Take-
Down”). If the Shelf Holders elect in a written request delivered to the Corporation (an “Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice”), a Shelf Take-Down may
be in the form of an Underwritten Offering (an “Underwritten Shelf Take-Down”) and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an amendment or
supplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose as soon as practicable. The Shelf Holders shall indicate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down
Notice whether they intend for such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to involve a customary “road show” (including an “electronic road show”) or other
marketing effort by the underwriters (a “Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down”). If the Shelf Holders desire to effect a Shelf Take-Down that does not
constitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, and that does not involve an Underwritten Offering (a “Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down”), the
Shelf Holders shall so indicate in a written request delivered to the Corporation no later than two calendar days prior to the expected date of such Non-
Marketed Shelf Take-Down, which request shall include (i) the total number of Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-
Marketed Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of
 
-3-
Table of Contents
distribution of such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or actions required (including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-
Marketed Shelf Take-Down, and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an amendment or supplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose
as soon as practicable. All determinations as to whether to complete any Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down and as to the timing, manner, price and other
terms of any Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down shall be at the discretion of the Shelf Holders. The Corporation shall not be required to effect more than
three Underwritten Shelf Take Downs in any rolling twelve-month period and shall not be required to effect any Underwritten Shelf Take Down unless the
aggregate gross proceeds expected to be received from the sale of Registrable Securities in such offering is at least $100 million.
(c)    Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, promptly upon receipt of any such Registration Request, the Corporation will use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such registration under the Securities Act within 120 days of such request (subject to any lock-up restrictions) of the
Registrable Securities that the Corporation has been so requested to register, including, without limitation, filing post-effective amendments, appropriate
qualification under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with the applicable regulations promulgated under the
Securities Act. At any time prior to the registration, the Apollo Stockholders may revoke a Registration Request by providing a notice to the Corporation
revoking such Registration Request.
(d)    If the Corporation receives a Registration Request and the Corporation furnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board
(certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation for a
Registration Statement (or an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down or a Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down) to be filed or effected on or before the date such filing
or take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder, the Corporation shall have the right to defer such filing or take-downs for a period of not more
than sixty (60) days after the date such filing or take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder (provided that such sixty (60) day period may be
extended to a period of up to ninety (90) days to the extent such suspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger,
acquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for such deferral set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied. If the Corporation
furnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board (certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith
judgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation to continue to permit the use of any prospectus contained any Shelf Registration
Statement, the Corporation shall be entitled to suspend the use of such prospectus for a reasonable period of time not to exceed (i) sixty (60) days in
succession (provided that such consecutive sixty (60) day period may be extended to a period of up to ninety (90) days in succession to the extent such
suspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger, acquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for
such suspension set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied (the “Extension Period”)) or (ii) ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve
(12) month period if the Extension Period has not been triggered or (iii) one hundred twenty (120) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve month period
if the Extension Period has been triggered. The Corporation shall not be permitted to take such action in the foregoing sentences more than twice in any
360-day period (except that the Corporation shall be able to use this right more than twice in any 12-month period if the Corporation is exercising such
right during the 15-day period prior to the Corporation’s regularly scheduled quarterly earnings announcement date and the total number of days of
postponement in such 12-month period does not exceed 120 days). If the Corporation shall so postpone the filing of a Registration Statement, the Apollo
Stockholders may withdraw their Registration Request by so advising the Corporation in writing. In addition, if the Corporation receives a Registration
Request and the Corporation is then in the process of preparing to register Common Stock in connection with a primary offering, the Corporation shall
inform the Apollo Stockholders of the Corporation’s intent to engage in a primary offering and may require the Apollo Stockholders to withdraw such
Registration Request for a period of up to 90 days so that the Corporation may complete its offering. In the event that the Corporation ceases to pursue
such primary offering, it shall promptly inform the Apollo Stockholders in writing and the Apollo Stockholders shall be permitted to submit a new
Registration Request. For the avoidance of doubt, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to participate in the Corporation’s primary offering as
provided in Section 3 (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to piggyback on the
Corporation’s primary offering).

Table of Contents
(e)    Registrations under this Section 2 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the SEC (i) as shall be selected by the Apollo Stockholders and
as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and (ii) as shall permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method or methods of disposition specified in the Registration Request. If, in connection with any registration under this Section 2 that is proposed by
the Apollo Stockholders to be on Form S-3 or any successor form, the managing underwriter, if any, shall advise the Apollo Stockholders or the
Corporation in writing that in its opinion the use of another permitted form is of material importance to the success of the offering, then such registration
shall be on such other permitted form.
(f)    The Corporation shall use its best efforts to keep any Registration Statement filed in response to a Registration Request effective for as long as is
necessary for the Apollo Stockholders to dispose of all of the covered securities.
(g)    In the case of an Underwritten Offering that is the subject of a Registration Request, the Apollo Stockholders shall select the underwriter(s)
(including the roles thereof); provided that such selection is reasonably acceptable to the Corporation.
(h)    From and after the date hereof until the termination of the Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain eligibility
to be able to file and use a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) and to be a “well-known seasoned issuer” within the
meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
Section 3.    Piggyback Registration Right.
(a)    Participation. Subject to Section 3(b), if the Corporation proposes to file a Registration Statement, whether on its own behalf or in connection with
the exercise of any registration rights by any holder of Registrable Securities possessing such rights (other than (i) a registration relating solely to an
employee benefit plan or employee stock plan, a dividend reinvestment plan, or a merger or a consolidation, (ii) a registration incidental to an issuance of
debt securities under Rule 144A, (iii) a registration on Form S-4 or any successor form or (iv) a registration on Form S-8 or any successor form), with
respect to an offering (for its own account or otherwise, and including any registration pursuant to Section 2) that includes any Registrable Securities,
then the Corporation shall give prompt notice (the “Initial Notice”) to the Apollo Stockholders, and the Apollo Stockholders shall be entitled to include in
such Registration Statement the Registrable Securities held by them. The Initial Notice shall offer the Apollo Stockholders the right, subject to
Section 3(b) (the “Piggyback Registration Right”), to register such number of shares of Registrable Securities as each such Apollo Stockholders may
request and shall set forth (A) the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement and (B) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that is
proposed to be included in such Registration Statement. Subject to Section 3(b), the Corporation shall include in such Registration Statement such
Registrable Securities for which it has received written requests to register within ten (10) days after the Initial Notice has been given.
(b)    Underwriters’ Cutback. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration pursuant to Section 2 or this Section 3 involves an Underwritten Offering
and the managing underwriter(s) of such proposed Underwritten Offering advises the Corporation or the Apollo Stockholders that the total or kind of
securities that the Apollo Stockholders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable), or that
the inclusion of certain holders of the Registrable Securities in such offering, would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the price, timing or
distribution of the securities offered in such offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable), then the number of securities proposed to be
included in such registration (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable) shall be allocated among the Corporation and the selling Apollo
Stockholders and other applicable holders of the Registrable Securities, such that the number of securities that each such Person shall be entitled to sell
in the Underwritten Offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable) shall be included in the following order:

such rights:
(1)    first, the securities held by the Person(s) exercising such registration rights and the holders of registrable securities requested to
be included in such registration pursuant to the terms of this Section 3 or pursuant to any other agreement containing piggyback

connection with such registration; and
(2)    second, the securities to be issued and sold by the Corporation in such registration.

(2)    second, the securities held by the Apollo Stockholders or other applicable holders of registrable securities requested to be
included in such registration pursuant to the terms of this Section 3 or pursuant to any other agreement containing piggyback
registration rights, pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered by each such Person in
connection with such registration.
(c)    Corporation Control. Except for a Registration Statement being filed in connection with the exercise of a Registration Request, a Short Form
Registration or a Shelf Registration subject to Section 2, the Corporation may decline to file a Registration Statement after giving the Initial Notice, or
withdraw any such Registration Statement after filing but prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement; provided that the Corporation shall
promptly notify each Apollo Stockholder who was to participate in such offering in writing of any such action; provided, further, that the Corporation
shall bear all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Apollo Stockholder or otherwise in connection with such unfilled or
withdrawn Registration Statement, up to a maximum of $50,000 for the Apollo Stockholders in the aggregate, and no Apollo Stockholders shall be deemed
to have made a Registration Request with respect to the unfilled or withdrawn Registration Statement. Except as provided in Section 2(g), the Corporation
shall have sole discretion to select any and all underwriters that may participate in any Underwritten Offering.
(d)    Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No Person may participate in any Underwritten Offering hereunder unless such Person agrees to sell such
Person’s securities on the basis provided in any customary underwriting arrangements approved by the Corporation and provides the questionnaires,
powers of attorney, customary indemnities, underwriting agreements, and other documents required for such underwriting arrangements. Nothing in this
Section 3(d) shall be construed to create any additional rights regarding the piggyback registration of Registrable Securities in any Person otherwise than
as set forth herein.
(e)    Expenses. As between the Corporation and the Apollo Stockholders, the Corporation will pay all registration fees and other expenses in connection
with each registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to Section 2 and this Section 3; provided that each Apollo Stockholder shall pay all
applicable underwriting fees, discounts and similar charges (pro rata based on the securities sold) and that the Apollo Stockholders shall be entitled to a
single counsel (at the Corporation’s expense) to be selected by the Apollo Stockholders.
Section 4.    Indemnification.
(a)    Indemnification by the Corporation. The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each selling Apollo
Stockholder, its officers, managers, employees, representatives, Affiliates, and any portfolio companies of any Apollo Stockholder or its Affiliates,
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
 
-6-
Table of Contents
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may be caused by or
contained in any information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder for use therein; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is caused by any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was
caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder expressly for use therein and has
not been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to the Person asserting such loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense.
(b)    Indemnification by Selling Apollo Stockholder. Each selling Apollo Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted
by law, the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees and representatives and each Person who controls the Corporation (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder expressly for use therein and has not been corrected in a
subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to the Person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. In no
event shall the liability of any selling Apollo Stockholder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such selling
Apollo Stockholder upon the sale of the securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation (except in the event of liability for fraud by such selling
Apollo Stockholder). The Corporation and the selling Apollo Stockholder shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer
managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with respect to information
so furnished in writing by such Persons specifically for inclusion in any Registration Statement or Prospectus.
(c)    Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt (but in any event within thirty
(30) days after such Person has actual knowledge of the facts constituting the basis for indemnification) written notice to the indemnifying party of any
claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party
of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure; provided, further, however, that
any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such
claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay
such fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of
such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (C) in the reasonable
judgment of any such Person, based upon advice of counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party with
respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If such
defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent
(but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnified party shall not have any obligation to consent to any settlement involving the
imposition of equitable remedies or involving the imposition of any material obligations on such indemnified party other than financial obligations for
which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. No indemnified party will have any obligation to consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
 
-7-
Table of Contents
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Whenever the indemnified party or the indemnifying party receives a
firm offer to settle a claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder, it shall promptly notify the other of such offer. If the indemnifying party refuses
to accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such offer (or of notice thereof), such claim shall continue to be contested and, if
such claim is within the scope of the indemnifying party’s indemnity contained herein, the indemnified party shall be indemnified pursuant to the terms
hereof. If the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing that the indemnifying party desires to accept such offer, but the indemnified
party refuses to accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the indemnified party may continue to contest such claim
and, in such event, the total maximum liability of the indemnifying party to indemnify or otherwise reimburse the indemnified party hereunder with respect
to such claim shall be limited to and shall not exceed the amount of such offer, plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and disbursements) to the date of notice that the indemnifying party desires to accept such offer; provided that this sentence shall not
apply to any settlement of any claim involving the imposition of equitable remedies, to any settlement imposing any material obligations on such
indemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder, or to any settlement that does not
include an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such claim or proceeding. An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense or a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim in any one jurisdiction, unless in the written opinion of
counsel to the indemnified party, reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party, use of one counsel would be expected to give rise to a conflict of
interest between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall
be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of each additional counsel.
(d)    Other Indemnification. Indemnification similar to that specified in this Section 4 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Corporation
and each selling Apollo Stockholder with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under federal or state law or regulation of
governmental authority other than the Securities Act.
(e)    Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in Section 4(a) and Section 4(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient
to hold such indemnified party harmless as contemplated by Section 4(a) and Section 4(b), then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits received by the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, but also the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided that no selling Apollo Stockholder shall be required to contribute in an amount
greater than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such selling Apollo Stockholder with respect to the sale of any securities hereunder. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not itself guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 2    Board of Directors.
(a)    Nomination of Directors. The Apollo Majority shall have the right, but not the obligation, to nominate for election to the Board:
(i)    up to four (4) directors, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 30% of the Outstanding Stock, provided that
at least two (2) of the directors nominated pursuant to this
 
E-3
Table of Contents
provision shall be “independent” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) American listing standards (or applicable
requirements of such other national securities exchange designated as the primary market on which the Common Stock is then listed for trading)
(such independence requirement, the “Independence Requirement” and any Apollo Director satisfying such Independence Requirement, an
“Independent Apollo Director”);
(ii)    up to three (3) directors, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 20% of the Outstanding Stock but less than
30% of the Outstanding Stock, provided that at least one (1) of the directors nominated pursuant to this provision shall be an Independent Apollo
Director;
(iii)    up to two (2) directors, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 10% of the Outstanding Stock but less than
20% of the Outstanding Stock, none of whom shall be required to be an Independent Apollo Director; and
(iv)    up to one (1) director, so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 5% of the Outstanding Stock but less than
10% of the Outstanding Stock, who shall not be required to be an Independent Apollo Director.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Board will consist of at least eleven (11) directors and, so long as the restrictions set forth in Section 6 apply, Apollo shall
not be entitled to nominate any directors other than those set forth above. The directors appointed to the Board pursuant to the foregoing clauses
(i) through (iv), together with any replacements to such directors appointed pursuant to Section 2(c) of this Agreement, shall hereinafter be referred to as
the “Apollo Directors”. The initial Apollo Directors shall be mutually acceptable to the Corporation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and any replacement Apollo Directors shall be approved by a majority of the non-Apollo Directors of the Board (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), provided that the Corporation agrees that Matthew Nord and Robert Kalsow-Ramos are
acceptable individuals to serve as Apollo Directors.
In addition to the above, the Parties agree that one director shall be the person then serving as the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation (the “CEO
Director”), who shall initially be, effective upon the closing of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
Richard Hume. In the event that the CEO Director shall cease to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for any reason, the Parties shall
cause (i) the former Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation to be promptly removed from the Board if such person has not resigned as a member of the
Board; and (ii) such person’s replacement as the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation to be appointed as the new CEO Director.
The Board of the Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement shall determine who shall fill the remaining six
(6) director seats (i.e. the non-Apollo Director and the non-CEO Director seats).
In the event the size of the Board is increased or decreased at any time to other than eleven (11) directors, the Apollo Stockholders’ collective nomination
rights under this Section 2(a) shall be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, so that the Board is composed of a number of Apollo
Directors that most closely equals the percentage of the Board originally composed of the Apollo Directors pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iv), rounded up to the nearest whole number. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Apollo elects not to fill a board seat to which it is entitled, the size of the
Board shall be reduced until such time as Apollo determines to fill such seat at which time it shall be correspondingly increased.
(b)    Election of Directors. The Corporation shall take all commercially reasonable action within its power to cause all nominees timely nominated
pursuant to Section 2(a) to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board to the Corporation’s stockholders for election as directors at
each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation (and/or in connection with any election by written consent or at a special meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation), and the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
 
E-4
Table of Contents
cause the election of each such nominee, including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such nominees, in each case subject to applicable law (for
the avoidance of doubt, the Corporation will be required to use substantially the same level of efforts and provide substantially the same level of support
as is used and/or provided for the other director nominees of the Corporation with respect to the applicable annual meeting of stockholders or action by
written consent in lieu of such meeting). For the avoidance of doubt, failure of the stockholders of the Corporation to elect any Apollo Director to the
Board shall not affect the right of the Apollo Stockholders to nominate directors for election pursuant to Section 2(a) in any future election of directors.
(c)    Replacement of Directors. In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death, disqualification, resignation, removal or failure to be
elected by the Company stockholders (and no other director has been elected by the stockholders of the Corporation to fill such vacancy) of an Apollo
Director nominated pursuant to Section 2(a), or designated pursuant to this Section 2(c), the Apollo Majority shall have the right to designate a
replacement to fill such vacancy for the Apollo Director consistent with the provisions of Section 2(a) (including being reasonably acceptable to the
Board, excluding the Apollo Directors), and if the Apollo Majority exercises such right, the Board shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
designee to be promptly appointed to the Board to fill such vacancy, subject to applicable law.
(d)    Removal of Directors. Upon the written request of the Apollo Majority seeking to remove and/or replace an Apollo Director nominated pursuant to
Section 2(a), or designated pursuant to Section 2(c), the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such request, including
to promptly call a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call more than a
total of two special meetings with respect to the removal of Apollo Directors.
(e)    Committees. The Board shall determine the composition and make-up of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, and any other committee of the Board.
(f)    Board Leadership. The lead independent director shall be selected by the Board.
(g)    Laws and Regulations. Nothing in this Section 2 shall be deemed to require that any party hereto, or any director of the Corporation, act in violation
of any applicable provision of law, regulation, legal duty or requirement or stock exchange rule.
(h)    Diversity Requirements. So long as any Apollo Directors are required to be Independent Apollo Directors pursuant to this Section 2, Independent
Apollo Directors, and Persons nominated as Independent Apollo Directors pursuant to this Section 2, shall fulfill their pro rata portion (rounded to the
nearest whole number) of any diversity requirements pursuant to law, stock exchange rules or similar regulatory requirements binding on the Corporation
based on the percentage of the Board composed of the Apollo Directors (for example, if Apollo Directors constitute four of eleven members of the Board,
including two Independent Apollo Directors, and the Board is required by applicable law to have a minimum of three female directors, one of the
Independent Apollo Directors would be required to be female); provided that (i) the Apollo Stockholders may elect to satisfy all or part of any such pro
rata allocation with non-Independent Apollo Directors in lieu of Independent Apollo Directors and (ii) once duly elected or appointed, no Apollo Director
shall be required prior to the next annual meeting to resign or be removed from the Board as a result of failing to meet such diversity requirements.
(i)    [Waiver of Corporate Opportunity. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and subject to any express agreement otherwise that may from time to
time be in effect, the Corporation agrees that any Apollo Director, any Apollo Entity and any Affiliate or portfolio company thereof (collectively,
“Covered Persons”) may, and shall have no duty not to, (i) invest in, carry on and conduct, whether directly, or as a partner in any partnership, or as a
joint venturer in any joint venture, or as an officer, director, stockholder, equityholder or investor in any person, or as a participant in any syndicate, pool,
trust or association, any business of any kind, nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of
business
 
E-5
Table of Contents
as the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) do business with any client, customer, vendor or lessor of any of the Corporation or its Affiliates; and/or
(iii) make investments in any kind of property in which the Corporation may make investments. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and subject to
any express agreement otherwise that may from time to time be in effect, the Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy to participate in any
business or investments of any Covered Person as currently conducted or as may be conducted in the future, and waives any claim against a Covered
Person arising in connection with or relating to a such Covered Person’s participation in any such business or investment. The Corporation agrees that,
subject to any express agreement otherwise that may from time to time be in effect, in the event that a Covered Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or matter which may constitute a corporate opportunity for both (x) the Covered Person outside of his or her capacity as a member of the
Board and (y) the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, the Covered Person shall not have any duty to offer or communicate information regarding such
corporate opportunity to the Corporation or its Subsidiaries. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest
or expectancy in any potential transaction or matter of which the Covered Person acquires knowledge, except as subject to any express agreement
otherwise that may from time to time be in effect or for any corporate opportunity which is expressly offered to a Covered Person in writing solely in his or
her capacity as a member of the Board, and waives any claim against each Covered Person arising in connection with or relating to the fact that such
Covered Person (A) pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for its own account or the account of any Affiliate or other person, (B) directs,
recommends, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers such corporate opportunity to another person or (C) does not communicate information regarding such
corporate opportunity to the Corporation; provided, that, in each such case, that any corporate opportunity which is expressly agreed by the Apollo
Entities to belong to the Corporation or is expressly offered to a Covered Person in writing solely in his or her capacity as a member of the Board shall
belong to the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under no circumstances shall (i) an employee of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries be deemed to be a “Covered Person”, and (ii) the Corporation be deemed to have waived or renounced any interest or expectancy of the
Corporation in, or in being offered any opportunity to participate in, any corporate, business, or investment opportunity that is presented to an employee
of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, irrespective of whether such employee (a) is a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective Affiliates or (b) otherwise would be an Cover Person absent being an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.]1
Section 3    Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. The Corporation shall maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance as determined by the Board. The
Corporation acknowledges and agrees that any Apollo Directors who are partners, members, employees, or consultants of any Apollo Entity may have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by the applicable Apollo Entity (collectively, the “Apollo
Indemnitors”). The Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort with respect to any indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided in the Charter, Bylaws and/or any indemnification agreements to any Apollo Director in his or her
capacity as a director of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (such that the Corporation’s obligations to such indemnitees in their capacities as
directors are primary and any obligation of the Apollo Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification or insurance for the same expenses
or liabilities incurred by such indemnitees are secondary). Such indemnitees shall, in their capacities as directors, be entitled to all the rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and entitled to insurance to the extent provided under (i) Charter and/or Bylaws in effect from time to time
and/or (ii) such other agreement, if any, between the Corporation and such indemnitees, without regard to any rights such indemnitees may have against
the Apollo Indemnitors. No advancement or payment by the Apollo Indemnitors on behalf of such indemnitees with respect to any claim for which such
indemnitees have sought indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance from the Corporation in their capacities as directors shall affect the
foregoing and the Apollo Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the
rights of recovery of such indemnitees against the Corporation.

Section 4    Information.
(a)    For so long as the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own at least 10% of the Outstanding Stock, the Corporation shall, and shall cause its
material Subsidiaries to, permit the Apollo Stockholders and their respective designated representatives, at reasonable times and upon reasonable prior
notice to the Corporation, to inspect, review and/or make copies and extracts from the books and records of the Corporation or any of such material
Subsidiaries and to discuss the affairs, finances and condition of the Corporation or any of such material Subsidiaries with the officers of the Corporation
or any such material Subsidiary, and with respect to matters pertaining to any and all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the Corporation will furnish to the Apollo
Stockholders any information and other reasonable assistance requested by the Apollo Majority in connection with the filing of any Tax Return. For so
long as the Apollo Stockholders beneficially own 10% or more in the aggregate of the Outstanding Stock, upon the written request from any Apollo
Stockholder and for the purposes set forth in the first sentence of Section 4(b), the Corporation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide such
Apollo Stockholder, in addition to other information that might be reasonably requested by such Apollo Stockholder from time to time, (i) direct access to
the Corporation’s auditors and officers, (ii) regularly prepared quarter-end reports, to be provided within such number of days after the end of each

Board) at the same time as provided to the directors (or members of such committee of the Board ), (iv) access to appropriate officers and directors of the

the Board who is not an Independent Apollo Director, information in advance with respect to any significant corporate actions, including, without
limitation, extraordinary dividends or distributions, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions of assets, issuances of significant amounts of debt or equity and
material amendments to the Charter or Bylaws or the comparable governing documents of any of its material Subsidiaries, and to provide the Apollo
Stockholders with the right to consult with the Corporation and its material Subsidiaries with respect to such actions, (vi) flash data, in a format to be

Section 4(a), the “Information”). Subject to Section 4(b), any Apollo Stockholder (and any party receiving Information from such Apollo Stockholder)
who shall receive Information shall maintain the confidentiality of such Information, using the same degree of care that any Apollo Stockholder would
employ with respect to its own most sensitive proprietary, confidential or financial information. The Apollo Stockholders acknowledge and agree that all
of the information received by it in connection with this Agreement is of a confidential nature and may be regarded as material non-public information
under Regulation FD promulgated by the SEC and that such information must be kept confidential by the Apollo Stockholders and not disclosed,
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement does not prohibit any Person from disclosing any information
that constitutes the “tax treatment” or “tax structure” (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(ii)) of any relevant transaction.
The Apollo Stockholders have implemented appropriate measures designed to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws regarding trading in
connection with material non-public information. The Corporation shall not be required to provide such portions of any Information containing attorney-
client, work product or similar privileged information of the Corporation or other information required by the Corporation to be kept confidential pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with a third Person or applicable law, so long as the Corporation has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an arrangement pursuant to which it may provide such information to the Apollo Stockholders without the
loss of any such privilege or without violating such confidentiality obligation. The Corporation shall retain all books and records with respect to tax
matters pertinent to the Corporation relating any Pre-Closing Tax Period
 
E-7

until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and shall abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.
(b)    Individuals associated with the Apollo Entities may from time to time serve on the Board or the equivalent governing body of the Corporation’s
Subsidiaries. The Corporation, on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, recognizes that such individuals (i) will from time to time receive non-public
information concerning the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) may (subject to the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information in
accordance with Section 4(a)) share such information with other individuals associated with the Apollo Entities who have a need to know such
information for the purpose of facilitating support to such individuals in their capacity as members of the Board or such equivalent governing body or
enabling the Apollo Stockholders, as equityholders, to better evaluate the Corporation’s performance and prospects, provided that such other
individuals are informed about the confidential nature of such information and agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of such information
consistent with the confidentiality obligations under Section 4(a). The Corporation, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby irrevocably consents
to such sharing, subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in this paragraph. In the event that any Apollo Entity or any of its representatives are
requested or required by law, regulation or legal or regulatory process to disclose any non-public Information concerning the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, such Apollo Entity or such representative may disclose only that portion of the requested information which it is advised by counsel is
required by law, regulation or legal or regulatory process to be disclosed so long as such Apollo Entity or such representatives uses reasonable efforts to
obtain assurances that such disclosed information will be afforded confidential treatment and notifies the Corporation at least 5 business days in
advance, if permitted by applicable law and commercially feasible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Apollo Entity may disclose any information or data
that it can demonstrate: (i) is or was independently developed by an Apollo Entity or its representatives without the benefit of any non-public
Information or in breach of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 17, 2020, by and between the Corporation and Tiger Parent
(AP) Corporation, a Delaware corporation; (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by an Apollo Entity or
its representatives in breach of this Agreement or any other duty of confidentiality owed to the Corporation; (iii) becomes available to an Apollo Entity or
its representatives from a source other than the Corporation or any of its representatives, so long as that source is, to such Apollo Entity’s or its
representatives’ knowledge, as applicable, not prohibited from disclosing such information or data to them by any restrictions on disclosure or use or any
other duty of confidentiality to the Corporation; or (iv) is known to, or already in the possession of, an Apollo Entity or its representatives on a non-
confidential basis prior to it being furnished pursuant to this Agreement, so long as, to such Apollo Entity’s or its representatives’ knowledge, the source
of such information was not bound by any restrictions on disclosure or use or any other duty of confidentiality to the Corporation.
Section 5    Certain Actions.
(a)    Subject to the provisions of Section 5(b), without the approval of a majority of the directors then on the Board, which must include the approval of a

reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change in Voting Securities which generally affects or
is made available to all stockholders of the Corporation, provided, however, that the Apollo Entities may acquire or agree to acquire beneficial
ownership of Voting Securities, including any securities of the Corporation convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Voting Securities, to the
extent that after giving effect to such acquisition, the Apollo Entities would not collectively beneficially own (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the
Exchange Act) more than 45% of the outstanding Voting Securities, excluding any issuance by the Corporation of Voting Securities or options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Voting Securities (or the exercise thereof) to any Apollo Directors or Apollo Entity as compensation for the
membership of the Apollo Directors on the Board, and provided further, that any such acquisition of shares shall not be counted in determining the
rights under Article 2 hereof;
(v)    publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement prohibited by the foregoing; or
(vi)    knowingly instigate, facilitate, encourage or assist any third party to do any of the foregoing;
provided that this Section 6 shall in no way limit the activities of any director of the Corporation, so long as such activities are undertaken in his or her
capacity as a director of the Corporation; provided further that (other than as may be a violation of clauses (i) and (ii) above) the right or ability of the
Apollo Stockholders to exercise their rights under this Agreement or the exercise by the Apollo Stockholders of their right to vote shall not, in either case,
in and of itself, be deemed a breach of this Section 6.
(b)    The Apollo Entities further agree they shall not, without the prior written consent of the Corporation, publicly request the Corporation to amend or
waive any provision of this Section 6 (including this sentence) or do so in a manner that would require the Corporation to publicly disclose such request.

reasonably be expected to, require any public disclosure of such communications.
(c)    This Section 6 shall automatically terminate on the first date following the 90th day, after the Apollo Stockholders collectively beneficially own less
than 5% of the Outstanding Stock. Additionally, in the event that (i) the Corporation engages in, enters into or continues any material discussions or
negotiations regarding any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Change in Control, approves or recommends,
or publicly proposes to approve or recommend, any Change in Control, or enters into a definitive agreement providing for a Change in Control; (ii) any

Stockholder to any Person who is not an Affiliate of an Apollo Stockholder.

Exchange Act, it will file any and all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act (or, if the Corporation is not
required to file such reports, it will make publicly available such necessary information for so long as necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144, Rule
144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act) and that it will take such further action as the Apollo Stockholders may reasonably request, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable the Apollo Stockholders to sell shares of Common Stock without registration under the Securities Act within

time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.

Majority. No course of dealing between the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and the Apollo Stockholders (or any of them) or any delay in exercising any
rights hereunder will operate as a waiver of any rights of any party to this Agreement. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this

and, except for the Merger Agreement, supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings of the parties in connection therewith,

Section 2.    Registration Rights.
(a)    Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, at any time and from time to time after the date hereof, the Apollo Stockholders may make a written
request (“Registration Request”) to the Corporation for registration under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of all or part of
their Registrable Securities, provided that any Registration Request must be for Registrable Securities with an aggregate dollar value of $100 million or
greater, and the Apollo Stockholders may only make two Registration Requests, written requests for Short Form Registration, or written requests for Shelf
Registration, in the aggregate, in any rolling twelve month period. A Registration Request which does not result in an effective registration under the
Securities Act or a Registration Request that is withdrawn prior to the filing of the requested Registration Statement shall not be counted as a
Registration Request for purposes of the limits in the preceding sentence. All Registration Requests made pursuant to this Section 2 will specify the
aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and will also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof.
(b)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Corporation’s receipt of information from the Apollo Stockholders that is required by
applicable law to be included in such Shelf Registration regarding such Apollo Stockholders, within two Business Days after the Closing Date, the
Corporation shall file an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3ASR covering resales of the Registrable Securities by the Apollo
Stockholders, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective for a period of 3 years following the Closing
Date. In addition, (i) at any time that the Corporation is qualified for the use of Form S-3 promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor form
thereto, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to request in writing registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the Registrable
Securities beneficially owned by any member of the Apollo Stockholders group on Form S-3 (or any successor form) or any similar short form registration
statement, if available (a “Short-Form Registration”) and (ii) at any time, and from time to time, that the initial registration statement on Form S-3ASR or
other shelf registration statements is not in effect or will expire within 90 days, the Apollo Stockholders may request in writing a shelf offering on a
delayed or continuous basis in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act (including the registration statement referred to in the immediately
precedent sentence, a “Shelf Registration”), in which case the provisions of this Section 2(b) shall be applicable, provided that the Apollo Stockholders
may only make two Registration Requests, written requests for Short Form Registration, or written requests for Shelf Registration, in the aggregate, in any
rolling twelve month period. All written requests for Short Form Registration shall (i) specify the aggregate number of Registrable Securities intended to
be sold or disposed of, (ii) state the intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities and (iii) whether or not such Short Form Registration
shall be a Shelf Registration, and upon receipt of such request, the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities so requested to be registered. Any Apollo Stockholder whose Registrable Securities are
included in an effective Shelf Registration (a “Shelf Holder”) may initiate an offering or sale of all or part of such Registrable Securities (a “Shelf Take-
Down”). If the Shelf Holders elect in a written request delivered to the Corporation (an “Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice”), a Shelf Take-Down may
be in the form of an Underwritten Offering (an “Underwritten Shelf Take-Down”) and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an amendment or
supplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose as soon as practicable. The Shelf Holders shall indicate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down
Notice whether they intend for such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to involve a customary “road show” (including an “electronic road show”) or other
marketing effort by the underwriters (a “Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down”). If the Shelf Holders desire to effect a Shelf Take-Down that does not
constitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, and that does not involve an Underwritten Offering (a “Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down”), the
Shelf Holders shall so indicate in a written request delivered to the Corporation no later than two calendar days prior to the expected
 
E-17
Table of Contents
date of such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down, which request shall include (i) the total number of Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in
such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of distribution of such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or actions required
(including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down, and, if necessary, the Corporation shall file and effect an
amendment or supplement to its Shelf Registration for such purpose as soon as practicable. All determinations as to whether to complete any Non-
Marketed Shelf Take-Down and as to the timing, manner, price and other terms of any Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down shall be at the discretion of the
Shelf Holders. The Corporation shall not be required to effect more than three Underwritten Shelf Take Downs in any rolling twelve-month period and
shall not be required to effect any Underwritten Shelf Take Down unless the aggregate gross proceeds expected to be received from the sale of
Registrable Securities in such offering is at least $100 million.
(c)    Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, promptly upon receipt of any such Registration Request, the Corporation will use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such registration under the Securities Act within 120 days of such request (subject to any lock-up restrictions) of the
Registrable Securities that the Corporation has been so requested to register, including, without limitation, filing post-effective amendments, appropriate
qualification under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with the applicable regulations promulgated under the
Securities Act. At any time prior to the registration, the Apollo Stockholders may revoke a Registration Request by providing a notice to the Corporation
revoking such Registration Request.
(d)    If the Corporation receives a Registration Request and the Corporation furnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board
(certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation for a
Registration Statement (or an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down or a Non-Marketed Shelf Take-Down) to be filed or effected on or before the date such filing
or take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder, the Corporation shall have the right to defer such filing or take-downs for a period of not more
than sixty (60) days after the date such filing or take-downs would otherwise be required hereunder (provided that such sixty (60) day period may be
extended to a period of up to ninety (90) days to the extent such suspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger,
acquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for such deferral set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied. If the Corporation
furnishes to the Apollo Stockholders a copy of a resolution of the Board (certified by the secretary of the Corporation) stating that in the good faith
judgment of the Board it would be materially adverse to the Corporation to continue to permit the use of any prospectus contained any Shelf Registration
Statement, the Corporation shall be entitled to suspend the use of such prospectus for a reasonable period of time not to exceed (i) sixty (60) days in
succession (provided that such consecutive sixty (60) day period may be extended to a period of up to ninety (90) days in succession to the extent such
suspension is due to ongoing negotiations or discussions regarding a material merger, acquisition or other similar transaction and the requirements for
such suspension set forth in this sentence continue to be satisfied (the “Extension Period”)) or (ii) ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve
(12) month period if the Extension Period has not been triggered or (iii) one hundred twenty (120) days in the aggregate in any rolling twelve month period
if the Extension Period has been triggered. The Corporation shall not be permitted to take such action in the foregoing sentences more than twice in any
360-day period (except that the Corporation shall be able to use this right more than twice in any 12-month period if the Corporation is exercising such
right during the 15-day period prior to the Corporation’s regularly scheduled quarterly earnings announcement date and the total number of days of
postponement in such 12-month period does not exceed 120 days). If the Corporation shall so postpone the filing of a Registration Statement, the Apollo
Stockholders may withdraw their Registration Request by so advising the Corporation in writing. In addition, if the Corporation receives a Registration
Request and the Corporation is then in the process of preparing to register Common Stock in connection with a primary offering, the Corporation shall
inform the Apollo Stockholders of the Corporation’s intent to engage in a primary offering and may require the Apollo Stockholders to withdraw such
Registration Request for a period of up to 90 days so that the Corporation may complete its offering. In the event that the Corporation ceases to pursue
such primary offering, it shall promptly inform the Apollo Stockholders in writing and the Apollo Stockholders shall be permitted to submit a new
Registration Request. For the avoidance of
 
E-18
Table of Contents
doubt, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to participate in the Corporation’s primary offering as provided in Section 3 (and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 3, the Apollo Stockholders shall have the right to piggyback on the Corporation’s primary offering).
(e)    Registrations under this Section 2 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the SEC (i) as shall be selected by the Apollo Stockholders and
as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and (ii) as shall permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method or methods of disposition specified in the Registration Request. If, in connection with any registration under this Section 2 that is proposed by
the Apollo Stockholders to be on Form S-3 or any successor form, the managing underwriter, if any, shall advise the Apollo Stockholders or the
Corporation in writing that in its opinion the use of another permitted form is of material importance to the success of the offering, then such registration
shall be on such other permitted form.
(f)    The Corporation shall use its best efforts to keep any Registration Statement filed in response to a Registration Request effective for as long as is
necessary for the Apollo Stockholders to dispose of all of the covered securities.
(g)    In the case of an Underwritten Offering that is the subject of a Registration Request, the Apollo Stockholders shall select the underwriter(s)
(including the roles thereof); provided that such selection is reasonably acceptable to the Corporation.
(h)    From and after the date hereof until the termination of the Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain eligibility
to be able to file and use a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) and to be a “well-known seasoned issuer” within the
meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
Section 3.    Piggyback Registration Right.
(a)    Participation. Subject to Section 3(b), if the Corporation proposes to file a Registration Statement, whether on its own behalf or in connection with
the exercise of any registration rights by any holder of Registrable Securities possessing such rights (other than (i) a registration relating solely to an
employee benefit plan or employee stock plan, a dividend reinvestment plan, or a merger or a consolidation, (ii) a registration incidental to an issuance of
debt securities under Rule 144A, (iii) a registration on Form S-4 or any successor form or (iv) a registration on Form S-8 or any successor form), with
respect to an offering (for its own account or otherwise, and including any registration pursuant to Section 2) that includes any Registrable Securities,
then the Corporation shall give prompt notice (the “Initial Notice”) to the Apollo Stockholders, and the Apollo Stockholders shall be entitled to include in
such Registration Statement the Registrable Securities held by them. The Initial Notice shall offer the Apollo Stockholders the right, subject to
Section 3(b) (the “Piggyback Registration Right”), to register such number of shares of Registrable Securities as each such Apollo Stockholders may
request and shall set forth (A) the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement and (B) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities that is
proposed to be included in such Registration Statement. Subject to Section 3(b), the Corporation shall include in such Registration Statement such
Registrable Securities for which it has received written requests to register within ten (10) days after the Initial Notice has been given.
(b)    Underwriters’ Cutback. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration pursuant to Section 2 or this Section 3 involves an Underwritten Offering
and the managing underwriter(s) of such proposed Underwritten Offering advises the Corporation or the Apollo Stockholders that the total or kind of
securities that the Apollo Stockholders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable), or that
the inclusion of certain holders of the Registrable Securities in such offering, would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the price, timing or
distribution of the securities offered in such offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable), then the number of securities proposed to be
included in such
 
E-19
Table of Contents
registration (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable) shall be allocated among the Corporation and the selling Apollo Stockholders and other
applicable holders of the Registrable Securities, such that the number of securities that each such Person shall be entitled to sell in the Underwritten
Offering (or Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, as applicable) shall be included in the following order:
(i)    In the case of an exercise of any registration rights by the Apollo Stockholders or any other holder of Registrable Securities possessing such
rights:
(1)    first, the securities held by the Person(s) exercising such registration rights and the holders of registrable securities requested to be
included in such registration pursuant to the terms of this Section 3 or pursuant to any other agreement containing piggyback registration
rights, pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered by each such Person in connection with such
registration; and
(2)    second, the securities to be issued and sold by the Corporation in such registration.
(ii)    In all other cases:
(1)    first, the securities to be issued and sold by the Corporation in such registration; and
(2)    second, the securities held by the Apollo Stockholders or other applicable holders of registrable securities requested to be included in
such registration pursuant to the terms of this Section 3 or pursuant to any other agreement containing piggyback registration rights, pro
rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered by each such Person in connection with such registration.
(c)    Corporation Control. Except for a Registration Statement being filed in connection with the exercise of a Registration Request, a Short Form
Registration or a Shelf Registration subject to Section 2, the Corporation may decline to file a Registration Statement after giving the Initial Notice, or
withdraw any such Registration Statement after filing but prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement; provided that the Corporation shall
promptly notify each Apollo Stockholder who was to participate in such offering in writing of any such action; provided, further, that the Corporation
shall bear all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Apollo Stockholder or otherwise in connection with such unfilled or
withdrawn Registration Statement, up to a maximum of $50,000 for the Apollo Stockholders in the aggregate, and no Apollo Stockholders shall be deemed
to have made a Registration Request with respect to the unfilled or withdrawn Registration Statement. Except as provided in Section 2(g), the Corporation
shall have sole discretion to select any and all underwriters that may participate in any Underwritten Offering.
(d)    Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No Person may participate in any Underwritten Offering hereunder unless such Person agrees to sell such
Person’s securities on the basis provided in any customary underwriting arrangements approved by the Corporation and provides the questionnaires,
powers of attorney, customary indemnities, underwriting agreements, and other documents required for such underwriting arrangements. Nothing in this
Section 3(d) shall be construed to create any additional rights regarding the piggyback registration of Registrable Securities in any Person otherwise than
as set forth herein.
(e)    Expenses. As between the Corporation and the Apollo Stockholders, the Corporation will pay all registration fees and other expenses in connection
with each registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to Section 2 and this Section 3; provided that each Apollo Stockholder shall pay all
applicable underwriting fees, discounts and similar charges (pro rata based on the securities sold) and that the Apollo Stockholders shall be entitled to a
single counsel (at the Corporation’s expense) to be selected by the Apollo Stockholders.
Section 4.    Indemnification.
(a)    Indemnification by the Corporation. The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each selling Apollo
Stockholder, its officers, managers, employees,
 
E-20
Table of Contents
representatives, Affiliates, and any portfolio companies of any Apollo Stockholder or its Affiliates, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as
the same may be caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder for use therein;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is caused
by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission was caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder
expressly for use therein and has not been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to the Person
asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense.
(b)    Indemnification by Selling Apollo Stockholder. Each selling Apollo Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted
by law, the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees and representatives and each Person who controls the Corporation (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Corporation by such selling Apollo Stockholder expressly for use therein and has not been corrected in a
subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the securities to the Person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. In no
event shall the liability of any selling Apollo Stockholder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such selling
Apollo Stockholder upon the sale of the securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation (except in the event of liability for fraud by such selling
Apollo Stockholder). The Corporation and the selling Apollo Stockholder shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer
managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with respect to information
so furnished in writing by such Persons specifically for inclusion in any Registration Statement or Prospectus.
(c)    Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt (but in any event within thirty
(30) days after such Person has actual knowledge of the facts constituting the basis for indemnification) written notice to the indemnifying party of any
claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party
of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure; provided, further, however, that
any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such
claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay
such fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of
such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (C) in the reasonable
judgment of any such Person, based upon advice of counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party with
respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If such
defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent
(but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnified party shall not have any obligation to consent to any settlement involving the
imposition of equitable remedies or involving the imposition of any material obligations on such
 
E-21
Table of Contents
indemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. No indemnified party will have any
obligation to consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Whenever the indemnified party or the
indemnifying party receives a firm offer to settle a claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder, it shall promptly notify the other of such offer. If
the indemnifying party refuses to accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such offer (or of notice thereof), such claim shall
continue to be contested and, if such claim is within the scope of the indemnifying party’s indemnity contained herein, the indemnified party shall be
indemnified pursuant to the terms hereof. If the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing that the indemnifying party desires to accept
such offer, but the indemnified party refuses to accept such offer within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the indemnified party may
continue to contest such claim and, in such event, the total maximum liability of the indemnifying party to indemnify or otherwise reimburse the
indemnified party hereunder with respect to such claim shall be limited to and shall not exceed the amount of such offer, plus reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) to the date of notice that the indemnifying party desires to accept such
offer; provided that this sentence shall not apply to any settlement of any claim involving the imposition of equitable remedies, to any settlement
imposing any material obligations on such indemnified party other than financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be indemnified
hereunder, or to any settlement that does not include an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject
matter of such claim or proceeding. An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense or a claim will not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim in any one
jurisdiction, unless in the written opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party, use of one counsel
would be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such
claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of each additional counsel.
(d)    Other Indemnification. Indemnification similar to that specified in this Section 4 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Corporation
and each selling Apollo Stockholder with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under federal or state law or regulation of
governmental authority other than the Securities Act.
(e)    Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in Section 4(a) and Section 4(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient
to hold such indemnified party harmless as contemplated by Section 4(a) and Section 4(b), then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits received by the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, but also the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided that no selling Apollo Stockholder shall be required to contribute in an amount
greater than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such selling Apollo Stockholder with respect to the sale of any securities hereunder. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not itself guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Assumptions, Qualifications and Limiting Conditions
In performing its analyses and rendering this Opinion with respect to the Proposed Transaction, Duff & Phelps, with the Company’s consent:
 
1.
Relied upon the accuracy, completeness, and fair presentation of all information, data, advice, opinions and representations obtained from public
sources or provided to it from private sources, including Company management and Target management, and did not independently verify such
information;
 
2.
Relied upon the fact that the Board of Directors and the Company have been advised by counsel as to all legal matters with respect to the Proposed
Transaction, including whether all procedures required by law to be taken in connection with the Proposed Transaction have been duly, validly and
timely taken;
 
3.
Assumed that any estimates, evaluations, forecasts and projections furnished to Duff & Phelps were reasonably prepared and based upon the best
currently available information and good faith judgment of the person furnishing the same, and Duff & Phelps expresses no opinion with respect to
such projections or the underlying assumptions;
 
4.
Assumed that information supplied and representations made by Company management and Target management are substantially accurate
regarding the Company, the Target, and the Proposed Transaction;
 
F-2
Table of Contents
SYNNEX Corporation
Page 3 of 4
March 16, 2021
 
5.
Assumed that the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement are substantially accurate;
 
6.
Assumed that the final versions of all documents reviewed by Duff & Phelps in draft form conform in all material respects to the drafts reviewed;
 
7.
Assumed that there has been no material change in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects of the
Company or the Target since the date of the most recent financial statements and other information made available to Duff & Phelps, and that there
is no information or facts that would make the information reviewed by Duff & Phelps incomplete or misleading;
 
8.
Assumed that all of the conditions required to implement the Proposed Transaction will be satisfied and that the Proposed Transaction will be
completed in accordance with the Merger Agreement without any amendments thereto or any waivers of any terms or conditions thereof; and
 
9.
Assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Proposed Transaction will be
obtained without any adverse effect on the Company, the Target, or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Proposed Transaction.
To the extent that any of the foregoing assumptions or any of the facts on which this Opinion is based prove to be untrue in any material respect, this
Opinion cannot and should not be relied upon. Furthermore, in Duff & Phelps’ analysis and in connection with the preparation of this Opinion, Duff &
Phelps has made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, market and economic conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of any party involved in the Proposed Transaction.
Duff & Phelps has prepared this Opinion effective as of the date hereof. This Opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other
conditions as they exist and can be evaluated as of the date hereof, and Duff & Phelps disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of
any change in any fact or matter affecting this Opinion which may come or be brought to the attention of Duff & Phelps after the date hereof.
Duff & Phelps did not evaluate the Target’s solvency or conduct an independent appraisal or physical inspection of any of the Target’s specific assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise). Duff & Phelps has not been requested to, and did not, (i) initiate any discussions with, or solicit any indications of
interest from, third parties with respect to the Proposed Transaction, the assets, businesses or operations of the Target, or any alternatives to the
Proposed Transaction, (ii) negotiate the terms of the Proposed Transaction, and therefore, Duff & Phelps has assumed that such terms are the most
beneficial terms, from the Company’s perspective, that could, under the circumstances, be negotiated among the parties to the Merger Agreement and the
Proposed Transaction, or (iii) advise the Board of Directors or any other party with respect to alternatives to the Proposed Transaction.
Duff & Phelps is not expressing any opinion as to the market price or value of the Company’s common stock (or anything else) after the announcement or
the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. This Opinion should not be construed as a valuation opinion, credit rating, solvency opinion, an
analysis of the Target’s credit worthiness, as tax advice, or as accounting advice. Duff & Phelps has not made, and assumes no responsibility to make,
any representation, or render any opinion, as to any legal matter.
In rendering this Opinion, Duff & Phelps is not expressing any opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any of the
Company’s or the Target’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be paid by the Company in the
Proposed Transaction, or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
This Opinion is furnished solely for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the Proposed Transaction and is
not intended to, and does not, confer any rights or remedies
 
F-3

upon any other person, and is not intended to be used, and may not be used, by any other person or for any other purpose, without Duff & Phelps’
express consent. This Opinion (i) does not address the merits of the underlying business decision to enter into the Proposed Transaction versus any
alternative strategy or transaction; (ii) does not address any transaction related to the Proposed Transaction; (iii) is not a recommendation as to how the
Board of Directors or any stockholder should vote or act with respect to any matters relating to the Proposed Transaction, or whether to proceed with the
Proposed Transaction or any related transaction, and (iv) does not indicate that the consideration paid is the best possibly attainable under any
circumstances; instead, it merely states whether the consideration in the Proposed Transaction is within a range suggested by certain financial analyses.
The decision as to whether to proceed with the Proposed Transaction or any related transaction may depend on an assessment of factors unrelated to the
financial analysis on which this Opinion is based. This letter should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of Duff & Phelps to any
party.
This Opinion is solely that of Duff & Phelps, and Duff & Phelps’ liability in connection with this letter shall be limited in accordance with the terms set
forth in the engagement letter between Duff & Phelps and the Company dated February 15, 2021 (the “Engagement Letter”). This letter is confidential,
and its use and disclosure is strictly limited in accordance with the terms set forth in the Engagement Letter.
Disclosure of Prior Relationships
Duff & Phelps has acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors and will receive a fee for its services. No portion of Duff & Phelps’ fee is
contingent upon either the conclusion expressed in this Opinion or whether or not the Proposed Transaction is successfully consummated. Pursuant to
the terms of the Engagement Letter, Duff & Phelps’ fee is payable upon Duff & Phelps informing the Board of Directors that it is prepared to deliver the
Opinion. During the two years preceding the date of this Opinion, Duff & Phelps has provided financial opinions and valuation services to the Company,
and has provided valuation services to the Target’s private equity sponsor, Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its affiliates. For these prior
engagements, Duff & Phelps received customary fees, expense reimbursement, and indemnification.
Conclusion
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, Duff & Phelps is of the opinion that as of the date hereof the consideration to be paid by the Company in the
Proposed Transaction is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and its stockholders (without giving effect to any impact of the Proposed
Transaction on any particular stockholder other than in its capacity as a stockholder).
This Opinion has been approved by the Opinion Review Committee of Duff & Phelps.

                     Defendants.
 
  
  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
Plaintiff, as and for his complaint for securities fraud under California Corporations Code §25401, intentional misrepresentation and concealment, and
negligent misrepresentation and concealment, alleges upon personal knowledge as to himself and his own acts, and upon information and belief derived
from, inter alia, documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and publicly available news sources, as to all other matters, as
follows:
NATURE OF THE ACTION
1. This lawsuit is brought pursuant to California Corporations Code §25401 and the common law of California against SYNNEX Corporation (“SYNNEX”
or the “Company”), its board of directors (collectively the “Board” or the “Director Defendants”) as well as Tech Data Corporation (“Tech Data”).
Plaintiff, a shareholder of SYNNEX, asserts claims under California law in connection with SYNNEX’s transfer of $ 1.61 billion in cash and 44 million newly
issued shares of SYNNEX’s common stock (the “Share Issuance”), representing 45% of SYNNEX’s voting stock, to funds affiliated with private equity
fund Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the “Apollo Funds”) in exchange for Tech Data (the “Sale”), a corporation wholly owned by the Apollo Funds.
The Sale consideration amounts to $7.2 billion, or $1.2 billion more than the $6 billion that the Apollo Funds paid to purchase Tech Data almost one
year ago. Even the valuation prepared by Defendants’ financial advisor indicates that Defendants are overpaying for Tech Data.
 
G-1
COMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATIONTable of Contents
2. The transaction is being driven by the Defendants’ personal interests in empire building. The Sale will result in the combined company becoming the
world’s largest IT distributor, nearly $10 billion larger than its nearest competitor. Following the Sale, Dennis Polk, SYNNEX’s current Chief Executive
Officer, will serve as Executive Chairman of the combined Company and a majority of SYNNEX’s current, highly compensated directors will become
directors of the significantly larger, merged company and will receive additional compensation as a result of the merger.
3. The Sale and Share Issuance are subject to the approval of the shareholders of SYNNEX, including Plaintiff.
4. On or about May 3, 2021, in connection with soliciting action by Plaintiff in connection with the Sale and Share Issuance, the Defendants caused a
proxy statement (the “Proxy”) to be distributed to Plaintiff and other SYNNEX’s shareholders soliciting and urging shareholders, including Plaintiff, to
vote in favor of the Sale and Share Issuance.
5. The Proxy violates California Corporations Code §25401 and the common law of California because it contains intentionally false and misleading
statements regarding, among other things, the conflicts of interest of those promoting the Sale, and the financial information upon which SYNNEX’s
financial advisor, Duff & Phelps, LLC (“Duff & Phelps”), relied in formulating its opinion that the Sale consideration is fair to SYNNEX shareholders.
6. This action seeks, inter alia, to enjoin the Defendants from continuing to violate California Corporations Code §25401 and California common law and
to remedy the false and misleading statements in the Proxy.
7. This complaint asserts claims under California law only and specifically excludes, does not allege and disclaims any and all claims (i) asserted
derivatively on behalf of the corporation, (ii) for breach of fiduciary duties, (iii) arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (“DGCL”) or the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, and/or (iv) governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
JURISDICTION
8. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to the California Constitution, Article VI, Section 10, because this case is an
action not given by statute to other trial courts.
9. This Court has jurisdiction over the Defendants in this action pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 410.10 because SYNNEX is headquartered and has its
principal place of business in this State, the Director Defendants are residents of this State and/or and the improper conduct alleged in this Complaint
occurred in and/or was directed at this state.
10. Venue lies in this Court because certain Defendants, including, upon information and belief, Dwight Steffensen, are residents of San Luis Obispo
County.
THE PARTIES
11. Plaintiff Joel Zalvin has owned shares of SYNNEX at all relevant times.
12. Defendant SYNNEX is a corporation headquartered at 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont, California 94538. The Company is a Fortune 200 corporation and a
provider of a comprehensive range of distribution, systems design, and integration services for the technology industry to a wide range of enterprises.

technology distributors. Tech Data was a publicly traded corporation until June 2020 when it was acquired by the Apollo Funds for $6 billion. This Court
has jurisdiction over Tech Data because its actions challenged in this Complaint occurred in substantial part, were directed at, and/or were meant to have

SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS
25. On March 22, 2021, it was announced that SYNNEX would transfer $ 1.61 billion in cash and 44 million shares of SYNNEX’s common stock to the
Apollo Funds in exchange for ownership of Tech Data. The Sale consideration amounts to $7.2 billion, or $1.2 billion more than the $6 billion that the
Apollo Funds paid to purchase Tech Data just over a year ago. As noted public company merger and acquisition expert and Delaware Vice Chancellor
Travis Laster has written in a peer reviewed academic law journal:
Empirical studies of acquisitions consistently find that public company bidders often overpay for target’s, imposing significant losses on
bidder shareholders. Research also indicates that the losses represent true wealth destruction in the aggregate and not simply a wealth
transfer from bidder shareholders to target shareholders. Numerous studies have connected bidder overpayment with managerial agency
costs and behavioral biases that reflect management self-interest.
Afra Afsharipour and J. Travis Laster, Enhanced Scrutiny on the Buy Side, 53 GEORGIA LAW REVIEW 443, 446 (2019) (citations omitted, emphasis
added).
26. The Sale is being driven by Synnex management’s interest in empire building. Notably, it will result in the combined company becoming the world’s
largest IT distributor, nearly $ 10 billion larger than its nearest competitor. Following the Sale, Dennis Polk, SYNNEX’s current Chief Executive Officer, will
serve as Executive Chairman of the Company and six of SYNNEX’s current directors will become directors of the combined $57 billion company and will
benefit from a merger-related increase in personal compensation that is material to each. See Afra Afsharipour and J. Travis Laster, Enhanced Scrutiny on
the Buy Side, 53 GEORGIA LAW REVIEW 443, 447-448, 453 (2019) (“[n]umerous studies provide evidence that acquisitions offer significant benefits to
the bidder... in the form of increased compensation, power, and prestige” which can contaminate a Board’s judgment) (emphasis added).

27. The SYNNEX Board is highly entrenched. The average director has held his SYNNEX Board position for over 12 years, and several have remained on
the Board for nearly two decades.
28. The Director Defendants have caused SYNNEX to complete 21 acquisitions since SYNNEX went public in 2003. This has resulted in substantial
increases in director and officer compensation, which is tied to SYNNEX’s size and market capitalization.
29. CEO Polk’s compensation has tripled from $2,048,229 in 2015 to $6,202,995 in 2019. During that time, SYNNEX completed four large acquisitions
(Minacs, Tigerspike, Westcon-Comstor Americas, Convergys).
30. SYNNEX’s long-tenured non-employee directors have also benefited richly from the Board’s empire building strategy. Defendant Steffensen’s director
compensation has increased from $ 199,132 in 2009 to $315,118 in 2020. Defendant Breidenbach’s director compensation has increased from $ 159,339 in
2009 to $235,118 in 2020. Defendant Miau’s director compensation has increased from $ 165,411 in 2009 to $235,118 in 2020. Defendant Zitner’s director
compensation has increased from $ 158,511 in 2009 to $249,026 in 2020. During that time, the Board caused SYNNEX to complete 13 acquisitions. The
other non-employee directors have benefited from similar increases during their board tenure.
31. Consistent with past practice, SYNNEX’ acquisition of Tech Data is intended to and will likewise substantially and materially enhance director and
officer compensation.
32. The Director Defendants have publicly admitted that their personal financial interests in transaction-related compensation pose a director conflict of
interest that provides each with an incentive to favor the Sale regardless of whether it is in the best interests of SYNNEX shareholders:
SYNNEX’ stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of SYNNEX have interests in the [Sale] that are different from, or
in addition to, those of SYNNEX’ stockholders generally. These interests include the continued employment of certain executive officers of
SYNNEX by the combined company, the continued service of certain directors of SYNNEX as directors of the combined company, the treatment
in the [Sale] of outstanding equity, equity-based and incentive awards, severance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements,
and the right to continued indemnification of former directors and officers by the combined company.
Proxy at 22 (emphasis added).
33. In an attempt to justify this self-serving transaction, the Defendants have forecast large synergies —- over $200 million —- that the merger will
purportedly yield. But even if the synergies are realized, the $7.2 billion in cash and stock that SYNNEX will pay for Tech Data is grossly in excess of its
intrinsic value. The Board’s own financial adviser, Duff & Phelps, concluded that Tech Data is worth no more than $7.182 billion, even if all of the
predicted synergies are realized. And, without the synergies, Duff & Phelps concluded that Tech Data is worth as little as $5.542 billion. Thus, the
Director Defendants are overpaying anywhere from $38 million to $ 1.678 billion for Tech Data.
34. Legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett has criticized boards for doing exactly what the SYNNEX Board is doing here:
overpaying for a company that a CEO desires to acquire and using synergies to justify the acquisition:
Once [those who run a company] hunger[] for a deal, [they] will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinates will be
cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporate size. Investment bankers,
smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.) lf the historical performance of the
target falls short of validating its acquisition, large “synergies” will be forecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.

(emphasis added).
35. While the majority of SYNNEX’s directors will benefit from the Sale, it is to the detriment of Plaintiff and other SYNNEX shareholders. Apart from the
fact that SYNNEX is grossly overpaying for Tech Data, following the Sale, SYNNEX shareholders will own no more than approximately 55% of the
combined entity, while the remaining 45% block will be held by Apollo Funds. As a result, Apollo will have tremendous influence over the Company.
 
B.
The Materially Misleading and/or Incomplete Proxy
36. The Sale and Share Issuance Proposal are subject to the approval of SYNNEX’s public shareholders, including Plaintiff.
37. In connection therewith, SYNNEX has disseminated the Proxy to Plaintiff (and other SYNNEX shareholders) recommending that they vote in favor of
the Sale and Share Issuance. However, the Proxy misrepresents and/or omits material information as follows:
 
 
(i)
The Defendants admit that they have interests in the Sale including the continued employment of certain executive officers of SYNNEX by
the combined company, the continued service of certain directors of SYNNEX as directors of the combined company, the treatment in the
Sale of outstanding equity, equity-based and incentive awards, severance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements, and
the right to continued indemnification of former directors and officers. However, the Proxy does not disclose the extent of those interests
with regard to each of the Defendants. Among other things, the Proxy does not disclose (a) the identity of the directors who will continue to
serve as directors of the combined company, (b) the compensation that the executive officers will receive in connection with their continued
employment, (c) the compensation that the continuing directors will receive, (d) the payments that each director will receive in connection
with the accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards, (e) the substance of any and all discussions had by SYNNEX’s Board
regarding the composition of the company’s Board following the Sale, including the continuation of certain SYNNEX directors as directors
of the post-Sale Company, and (f) the substance of any and all discussion had by the Board regarding the continuation of CEO Polk as the
Executive Chairman, of the post-Sale company.
The conflicts of interest of SYNNEX’s directors are material and must be disclosed.
 
 
(ii)
According to the Proxy, during the two years preceding the date of its Fairness Opinion, Duff & Phelps provided financial opinions and
valuation services to SYNNEX and provided valuation services to Tech Data’s private equity sponsor, Apollo and its affiliates (collectively
“Apollo”). The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose (a) the total amounts paid by each of SYNNEX and Apollo to Duff & Phelps
for providing financial opinions and/or valuation services during the two years preceding the date of its Fairness Opinion, (b) the extent to
which Duff & Phelps was providing services to Apollo and its affiliates at the same time it was advising SYNNEX on its acquisition of Tech
Data and rendering the Fairness Opinion on the same, including the nature of such services and (c) the extent to which Duff & Phelps has
an expectation for providing future service to Apollo and the anticipated compensation in connection therewith.
The conflicts of interest of SYNNEX’S financial advisor are material and must be disclosed.
 
 
(iii)
According to the Proxy, on February 24, 2021, representatives of Tech Data and Apollo provided representatives of SYNNEX with updates
(the “February 24, 2021 Tech Data Projections”) to the Tech Data financial information that had been provided on January 20, 2021 (the
“January 20, 2021 Tech Data Projections”), which updates showed an improvement to Tech Data’ s financial forecasts. Also according to
the Proxy, in connection with formulating its Fairness Opinion, Duff & Phelps reviewed
 
G-7
COMPLAINT FOR INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION
Table of Contents
 
financial projections for Tech Data prepared by Tech Data’s management and also those as adjusted by SYNNEX’ management. While the
Proxy provides a summary of the Tech Data Projections, it is deficient because it does not (a) identify whether that summary is of the
January 10, 2021 projections or the February 24, 2021 projections, (b) disclose what accounts for the improvement in Tech Data’s financial
forecasts, and (c) a summary of the missing set of projections, i.e. if the Tech Data projections included in the proxy are the January 20, 2021
Tech Data Projections, then the February 24, 2021 Tech Data Projections and vice versa.
Information upon which the Director Defendants and their advisors relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.
This is especially so where, as here, the Company is to pay a $1.6 billion premium over what the Apollo Funds paid for Tech Data less than
one year ago.
 
 
(iv)
According to public sources, in June 2020, the Apollo Funds purchased Tech Data for $6 billion. The Proxy fails to disclose the
(a) substance of the discussions had by the Board regarding the payment of a $1.2 billion premium for Tech Data less than a year later and
(b) the Board’s rationale for failing to pursue Tech Data when it was for sale in 2019.
Information upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.
 
 
(v)
According to the Proxy, on February 18, 2021, the Board met via video conference to discuss the potential strategic transaction between
SYNNEX and Tech Data. SYNNEX’ management, among other things, provided an update on certain diligence matters, including recent
distributions to Apollo Funds’ affiliate, Tiger Holdings and redemptions of certain Tiger Holdings units paid by Tech Data. Following this,
the Board discussed the various matters presented by management, including whether there should be a renegotiation of the consideration
proposed in the transaction. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of the Board’s discussion of a renegotiation
of the consideration proposed in the transaction.
Information upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed. This is especially so
where, as here, the Company is to pay a $1.6 billion premium over what the Apollo Funds paid for Tech Data less than one year ago.
 
 
(vi)
According to the Proxy, on February 23, 2021, the Board met via video conference to discuss the potential strategic transaction between
SYNNEX and Tech Data. The Board discussed various matters relating to the transaction, including whether the purchase price should be
renegotiated. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of the Board’s discussion regarding whether the purchase
price should be renegotiated.
Information upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed. This is especially so
where, as here, the Company is to pay a $1.6 billion premium over what the Apollo Funds paid for Tech Data less than one year ago.
 
 
(vii)
According to the Proxy, at a March 2, 2021 meeting SYNNEX’s management provided an update on, among other things, the composition of
the Board post-closing and the Board discussed the composition of the Board following the transaction and potential changes in
management. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of (a) SYNNEX’s management’s update on composition of
the Board post-closing and (b) the Board’s discussion of the composition of the Board following the transaction and potential changes in
management.
Information upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.
 
 
(viii)
According to the Proxy, on March 10, 2021, representatives of each of Tech Data and Apollo called Mr. Polk to propose that, in addition to
the previously discussed purchase price of 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock together with the $1.61 billion payout for
outstanding preferred units of Tiger Holdings, Apollo make a $500 million equity contribution to Tech Data at the close of the

transaction (which would result in a net cash payment for the outstanding preferred units to Tiger Holdings of $1.11 billion in the Sale). The
Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance of Mr. Polk’s discussion with Tech Data’s and Apollo’s representatives of
Tech Data and Apollo’s proposal to make a $500 million equity contribution to Tech Data at the close of the transaction.
Information upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.
 
 
(ix)
According to the Proxy, at a March 11, 2021 Board meeting, the Board discussed the potential transaction, including the proposed
$500 million investment by Apollo as well as the appropriate composition of the Board following the potential transaction. The Proxy is
deficient because it does not disclose the substance of the Board’s discussion regarding (a) the proposed $500 million investment by
Apollo and (b) the appropriate composition of the Board following the potential transaction, including the identity of the SYNNEX’s
directors who would continue to serve on the Company’s Board post-Sale.
Information upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.
 
 
(x)
According to the Proxy, at a March 15, 2021 Board meeting, the Board discussed, among other things, the proposed composition for the
Board following the closing and the appointment of the Apollo director designees. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the
substance of the Board’s discussion regarding the proposed composition for the Board following the closing, including the identity of the
SYNNEX’s directors who would continue to serve on the Company’s Board post-Sale.
Information upon which the Director Defendants relied in connection with the Sale is material and must be disclosed.
 
 
(xi)

and (2) Diligence Discussion Materials Presentation dated January 2021. The Proxy is deficient because it does not disclose the substance

VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE § 25401
(Against all Defendants)
55. Plaintiff repeats and realleges all previous allegations as if set forth in full herein.
56. On or about May 3, 2021, SYNNEX and the Director Defendants disseminated and circulated the Proxy to the shareholders of SYNNEX, including
Plaintiff.

58. Tech Data participated in the dissemination of the Proxy by supplying information to SYNNEX with knowledge that it would be included in the Proxy.

importance to the facts omitted or misrepresented in determining whether to vote for or against the Sale and Share Issuance.
60. As members of SYNNEX’s board of directors, the Director Defendants were responsible for and had ultimate authority over the false and misleading

shareholders with knowledge of its falsity intending SYNNEX shareholders to rely on the false and misleading statements and omissions.

statements and omissions promulgated by the Defendants in the Proxy disseminated to Plaintiff and the other SYNNEX shareholders.
63. By reason of the foregoing, the Defendants have violated 25401 and should be II enjoined from continuing such violation.
64. Absent an injunction, Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm.

Plaintiff, by his undersigned attorneys, for this complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon
information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:
BACKGROUND
1. This action concerns a proposed transaction (“Proposed Transaction”) announced on March 22, 2021, pursuant to which SYNNEX Corp., (“SYNNEX”
or the “Company”) will merge with Tiger Parent Corporation (“Tiger Parent”), the indirect parent of Tech Data Corporation (“Tech Data”), which is wholly
owned by funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (“Apollo Funds”).
2. On March 22, 2021, SYNNEX’s Board of Directors (the “Board” or “Individual Defendants”) caused the Company to enter into an agreement and plan
of merger (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Apollo Funds will receive 1.61 billion in cash and 44 million shares
of SYNNEX common stock plus the refinancing of existing Tech Data net debt and redeemable preferred shares of approximately $2.7 billion. (the “Merger
Consideration”).
3. Upon closing of the transaction, SYNNEX shareholders will own approximately 55% of the combined company, with Apollo Funds owning
approximately 45%.
4. On May 3, 2021, in order to convince SYNNEX’s Shareholders to vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, Defendants filed a materially incomplete
and misleading Proxy Statement (the “Proxy”) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
5. The Proxy Statement omits material information with respect to the Proposed Transaction, which renders the Proxy Statement false and misleading.
Accordingly, Plaintiff alleges herein that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”) in
connection with the Proxy.
6. In addition, a special meeting of SYNNEX’s stockholders will be held to vote on the Proposed Transaction (the “Stockholder Vote”). It is therefore
imperative that the material information that has been omitted from the Proxy is disclosed prior to the Stockholder Vote so SYNNEX’s stockholders can
properly exercise their corporate voting rights and make an informed decision on whether to vote in favor of the merger.

Most Admired Companies for 11 straight years.
25. On March 22, 2021, SYNNEX’s Board caused the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement.
According to the press release announcing the Proposed Transaction:
FREMONT, CA and CLEARWATER, FL, March 22, 2021 – SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE: SNX) and Tech Data today announced they have entered
into a definitive merger agreement under which SYNNEX and Tech Data will combine in a transaction valued at approximately $7.2 billion, including
net debt. The combined company, with approximately $57 billion in estimated pro forma annual revenues and a team of over 22,000 associates and
colleagues, will provide customers and vendors with expansive reach across products, services, and geographies to accelerate technology
adoption.
“We are excited to partner with a world-class industry leader like Tech Data and believe that this combination will benefit all our stakeholders,” said

cloud, data, and IoT technologies, which are experiencing explosive growth due to work from home and return to office trends. We could not have
reached this milestone without the hard work of our colleagues, and we look forward to working together with the SYNNEX team to seamlessly
bring our companies together and to create meaningful value for all our stakeholders.”

Key Transaction Details
 
 
•
 Under the terms of the agreement, Apollo Funds will receive an aggregate of 44 million shares of SYNNEX common stock plus the
refinancing of existing Tech Data net debt and redeemable preferred shares of approximately $2.7 billion.
 
 
•
 Upon closing of the transaction, SYNNEX shareholders will own approximately 55% of the combined entity, with Apollo Funds owning
approximately 45%.
 
 
•
 Rich Hume will lead the combined company as CEO. Dennis Polk will be Executive Chair of the Board of Directors and will take an active role
in the ongoing strategy and integration of the business, among other responsibilities.
 
 
•
 The combined company will have an eleven-member board, including Rich Hume, with six individuals appointed by SYNNEX and with
Apollo Funds to have Board designation rights based on ownership, initially including four total directors, two of whom will be
independent.
 
 
•
 Non-GAAP diluted EPS accretion of more than 25% is expected in year one post close, with further accretion expected in year two.
 
 
•
 Net optimization and synergy benefits of $100 million are expected in the first year after closing, achieving a minimum of $200 million by the
end of the second year.
 
H-3
Table of Contents
 
•
 The combined company will benefit from a strong financial foundation and an investment grade profile. Based on LTM pro-forma adjusted
EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and expected combined debt of approximately $4.0 billion at close, debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is
expected to be approximately 2.7x at transaction close and is expected to decline to approximately 2x within 12 months.
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including
approval by SYNNEX stockholders and regulatory approvals. MiTAC Holdings Corporation and its affiliates, which collectively owned
approximately 17% of SYNNEX shares as of January 22, 2021, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the transaction. Until the transaction is
completed, the companies will continue to operate independently.
***
26. The Merger Consideration is unfair because, among other things, the intrinsic value of the Company is in excess of the amount the Company’s
stockholders will receive in connection with the Proposed Transaction.
27. It is therefore imperative that the Company’s shareholders receive the material information that Defendants have omitted from the Proxy so that they
can meaningfully assess whether the Proposed Transaction is in their best interests prior to the vote.
28. Section 7.10 of the Merger Agreement has an “acquisition proposals” clause that prevents SYNNEX from soliciting alternative proposals and
constraints its ability to negotiate with potential buyers:
(a) Acquisition Proposals
Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers not to, and shall not
permit its and their other respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with any person
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term
sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with
this Section 7.10) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Each party will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other
than Parent or the Company, as applicable, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and request the return or destruction of any confidential
information previously delivered to any such person pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement to the extent provided by such
agreement.
29. In addition, Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement requires SYNNEX to pay up to $131,683,200.00 “termination fee” in the event this agreement is
terminated by SYNNEX and improperly constrains the Company from obtaining a superior offer. Such a termination fee is excessive and unduly restrictive
to SYNNEX’s ability to consider other offers.
30. Defendants filed the Proxy with the SEC in connection with the Proposed Transaction.
31. The Proxy omits material information concerning SYNNEX’s and Tech Data’s financial projections and some of the significant factors considered by
the Board supporting its decision to approve the Merger.
 
H-4
Table of Contents
32. With respect to SYNNEX’s financial projections, the Proxy fails to disclose (i) all line items used to calculate non-GAPP net income and adjusted
EBITDA; and (ii) a reconciliation of all non-GAAP to GAAP metrics.
33. With respect to Tech Data’s financial projections, the Proxy fails to disclose (i) all line items used to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash
flow; and (ii) a reconciliation of all non-GAAP to GAAP metrics.
34. The disclosure of projected financial information is material information necessary for stockholders to gain an understanding of the basis for any
projections as to the future financial performance of the combined company. In addition, this information is material and necessary for stockholders to
understand the financial analyses performed by the companies’ financial advisors rendered in support of any fairness opinion.
35. Second, the Proxy omits material information regarding the analyses performed by the Company’s financial advisor Duff Phelps, LLC (“Duff Phelps
Advisors”) in connection with the Proposed Transaction.
36. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors’ Discounted Cash Flow Analyses for Tech Data, the Proxy fails to disclose (1) unlevered free cash flows and all
underlying line items; (2) the terminal/continuing value of the Company; (3) the individual inputs and assumptions underlying the (i) discount rate range
of 10% to 11% (ii) terminal growth rates of 2.5%, (4) the alternative investment opportunities with similar risk profiles from which security holders could
expect a similar rate of return.
37. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors’ Selected Public Company Analyses for Tech Data, the Proxy fails to disclose Duff Phelps’s bases for selecting
each of the companies observed.
38. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors’ Public Companies / Selected M&A Transactions Analyses for Tech Data, the Proxy fails to disclose the
individual inputs and assumptions underlying the (i) LTM EBITDA multiple ranged of 9.0x to 10.0x; (ii) NTM EBITDA multiple ranged of 8.5x to 9.5x; and
(iii) NTM + 1 EBITDA multiple ranged of 8.0x to 9.0x.
39. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors’ Discounted Cash Flow Analyses for SYNNEX, the individual inputs and assumptions underlying the
(i) discount rate range of 10% to 11% and (ii) terminal growth rate of 2.5%
40. With respect to Duff Phelps Advisors’ Synergies Analyses the Proxy fails to disclose (1) the projected net Synergies for fiscal years January 2022 to
January 2024; (2) the terminal/continuing value of net Synergies; the individual inputs and assumptions underlying terminal growth rate of 2.5% .
41. Third, the Proxy Statement fails to disclose the terms of the confidentiality agreements, including whether the agreements contained standstill and/or
“don’t ask, don’t waive” provisions.
42. Fourth, the Proxy fails to disclose sufficient information regarding communications about post-transaction employment and directorship during the
negotiation of the Proposed Transaction.
43. Fifth, the Proxy omits material information regarding the engagement of Duff Phelps including the amount of the customary fees, expense
reimbursement, and indemnification Duff Phelps received from SYNNEX during the two years preceding the date of its Opinion and the amount of the
hourly rates Duff Phelps will charge for any time incurred should Duff & Phelps becalled upon to support its findings subsequent to the delivery of its
Opinion.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I
(AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS FOR VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 14(a) OF THE
EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 14a-9 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER)
44. Plaintiff incorporates each and every allegation set forth above as if fully set forth herein.
45. Rule 14a-9, promulgated by the SEC pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, requires that proxy communications with stockholders shall not
contain “any statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading.” 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a -9.
46. Defendants issued the Proxy with the intention of soliciting stockholder support for the Proposed Transaction. Each of the Defendants reviewed and
authorized the dissemination of the Proxy and the use of their name in the Proxy, which fails to provide critical information regarding, among other things,
the financial projections that were prepared by the Company and relied upon by the Board in recommending the Company’s stockholders vote in favor of
the Proposed Transaction.
47. In so doing, Defendants made untrue statements of fact and/or omitted material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading. By
virtue of their roles as officers and/or directors, each of the Individual Defendants were aware of the omitted information but failed to disclose such
information, in violation of Section 14(a). The Individual Defendants were therefore negligent, as they had reasonable grounds to believe material facts
existed that were misstated or omitted from the Proxy, but nonetheless failed to obtain and disclose such information to stockholders as required.
48. The preparation of a Proxy by corporate insiders containing materially false or misleading statements or omitting a material fact constitutes negligence.
Defendants were negligent in preparing and reviewing the Proxy. Defendants were also negligent in choosing to omit material information from the Proxy
or failing to notice the material omissions in the Proxy upon reviewing it, which they were required to do carefully.
49. The misrepresentations and omissions in the Proxy are material to Plaintiff, who will be deprived of her right to cast an informed vote if such
misrepresentations and omissions are not corrected prior to the vote on the Proposed Transaction. Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.
COUNT II
(AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS FOR VIOLATIONS OF
SECTION 20(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT)
50. Plaintiff incorporates each and every allegation set forth above as if fully set forth herein.
51. The Individual Defendants acted as controlling persons of the Company within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as alleged herein.
By virtue of their positions as directors of the Company, and participation in and/or awareness of the Company’s operations and/or intimate knowledge of
the incomplete and misleading statements contained in the Proxy filed with the SEC, they had the power to influence and control and did influence and
control, directly or indirectly, the decision making of the Company, including the content and dissemination of the various statements that Plaintiff
contends are materially incomplete and misleading.
 
H-6
Table of Contents
52. Each of the Individual Defendants was provided with or had unlimited access to copies of the Proxy and other statements alleged by Plaintiff to be
misleading prior to and/or shortly after these statements were issued and had the ability to prevent the issuance of the statements or cause the
statements to be corrected.
53. In particular, each of the Individual Defendants had direct and supervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Company, and, therefore,
is presumed to have had the power to control or influence the particular transactions giving rise to the Exchange Act violations alleged herein, and
exercised the same. The omitted information identified above was reviewed by the Board prior to voting on the Proposed Transaction. The Proxy at issue
contains the unanimous recommendation of the Board to approve the Proposed Transaction. The Individual Defendants were thus directly involved in
the making of the Proxy.
54. In addition, as the Proxy sets forth at length, and as described herein, the Individual Defendants were involved in negotiating, reviewing, and
approving the Merger Agreement. The Proxy purports to describe the various issues and information that the Individual Defendants reviewed and
considered. The Individual Defendants participated in drafting and/or gave their input on the content of those descriptions.
55. By virtue of the foregoing, the Individual Defendants have violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
56. As set forth above, the Individual Defendants had the ability to exercise control over and did control a person or persons who have each violated
Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9, by their acts and omissions as alleged herein. By virtue of their positions as controlling persons, these defendants are liable
pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. As a direct and proximate result of Individual Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed.
57. Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment and relief as follows:
A. Preliminarily and permanently enjoining defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the
Proposed Transaction;
B. In the event defendants consummate the Proposed Transaction, rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages;
C. Directing the Individual Defendants to disseminate a proxy that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material
facts required in it or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading;
D. Declaring that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the 1934 Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder;
E. Awarding Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable allowance for Plaintiff’s attorneys’ and experts’ fees; and
F. Granting such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.
