Merger Sub, an Ohio corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding and was formed on July 1, 2022, solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in any business activities other than as incidental
to its formation and in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and arranging of the equity financing and the debt
financing in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into Meridian, with Meridian surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding.
The Merger (see page 31)",9,10
MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,The Merger,"The Merger (see page 31)
The merger agreement provides for the acquisition of Meridian by Columbus Holding through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Meridian, which
we refer to as the “merger.” Meridian will be the surviving entity in the merger and, following the merger, be a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus
Holding. We anticipate that at the closing of the merger, SDB will own approximately 60% of Columbus Holding and SJL will control (directly or
through its affiliate) a special purpose vehicle that will own approximately 40% of Columbus Holding. As a result of the merger, Meridian common
stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market, which we refer to as the “NASDAQ.” In addition,
Meridian common stock will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the “Exchange Act,” and
Meridian will no longer file periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC.” If the
merger is completed, you will no longer own any shares of the capital stock of Meridian. The time at which the merger will become effective will
occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
2Table of Contents
OGCL. We refer to the time of such filing and the acceptance for record by the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, or such later time as may be
agreed in writing by Columbus Holding and Meridian and specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the OGCL, as the “effective time.”

If the merger agreement is not adopted by the Meridian shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Meridian shareholders
will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger, Meridian will remain an independent public company, and Meridian
expects that management will operate Meridian’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that Meridian
shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely
that the price of Meridian common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Meridian common
stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, Meridian may be required to pay Columbus Holding a termination
fee in an amount equal to $45,960,000.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Meridian common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares held in the treasury of the Company, owned by Columbus Holding, Merger
Sub, or owned by a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Meridian, Columbus Holding, or Merger Sub, immediately prior to the effective
time, and other than certain of such shares held on behalf of third parties, which we refer to collectively as “excluded shares,” and (ii) shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the merger and who
have properly exercised dissenters’ rights with respect to their shares in accordance with, and who have complied with, Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85
of the OGCL, which we refer to as “dissenting shares,” will be converted into the right to receive cash in the amount of $34.00, subject to any
required tax withholding.

Stock Options. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Meridian common stock granted under
Meridian’s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan or 2021 Omnibus Award Plan (collectively, the “Meridian stock plans”), whether vested or unvested, will be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Meridian common stock subject to
such option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share of Meridian common stock set forth in such
option. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days) following the effective time.
Restricted Share Units. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian restricted share unit granted under the Meridian stock plans will
be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the number of
shares of Meridian common stock underlying the Meridian restricted share unit. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10
business days) following the effective time; provided, however, that the cash payments in respect of four restricted share unit grants made in
connection with Meridian’s acquisition of EUPROTEIN Inc. in April 2022 will not accelerate in connection with the merger and will be paid out in
substantially equal installments in accordance with the remaining vesting schedule.

Performance Share Units. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian performance share unit granted under the Meridian stock
plans will be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the
number of shares of Meridian common stock determined as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved for the measurement period at the
target level of performance. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days) following the effective time.

After careful consideration, the Meridian board unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in
the best interests of Meridian and its shareholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (iii) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by Meridian; (iv) directed

As of December 2, 2019, Meridian retained Rothschild & Co US Inc., which we refer to as “Rothschild & Co,” as its financial advisor in connection
with its evaluation of the potential sale, merger or other business/strategic combination involving Meridian, including, without limitation, with
respect to the merger. Meridian selected Rothschild & Co based on its qualifications, expertise and familiarity with Meridian’s business and industry.
In connection with Rothschild & Co’s engagement, the Meridian Board requested that Rothschild & Co evaluate the fairness, from a financial point
of view, to the holders of Meridian common stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) of the merger consideration payable to such
holders in the merger. As part of its investment banking business, Rothschild & Co regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and other transactions.
On July 6, 2022, at a meeting of the Meridian Board held to evaluate the merger, Rothschild & Co delivered to the Meridian Board its oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 6, 2022, to the effect that, as of such date and on the basis of and
subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth in the written opinion, the merger consideration payable to the holders of
Meridian common stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Rothschild & Co’s written opinion, dated July 6, 2022, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is
incorporated herein by reference. Meridian’s shareholders are urged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. The summary of
Rothschild & Co’s opinion contained in Annex B is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion.

based interests) pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and to pay all related expenses, which would be approximately $1.53 billion based
upon the shares (and our other equity-based interests) outstanding as of September 2, 2022, will be funded through cash of SDB.",12,13

The exchange of Meridian common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should read
the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and consult your tax adviser regarding the particular tax

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters. The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, which we refer to as the “HSR Act,” which prevents Meridian and SDB from completing the merger until required information and
materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the “DOJ,” and the Federal Trade Commission,
which we refer to as the “FTC,” and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. Meridian and SDB submitted the requisite notification and
report forms under the HSR Act on July 21, 2022. The parties withdrew and resubmitted the merger control filing to the FTC and DOJ on August 22,
2022. The waiting period will expire at 11:59 PM on September 21, 2022.
CFIUS Approval. The merger is subject to approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), which we refer to as
the “CFIUS approval,” which requires that Meridian and Columbus Holding: (i) have received written notice from CFIUS pursuant to Section 721 of
the U.S. Defense Production Act of 1950, which we refer to as the “DPA,” indicating that (i) CFIUS has concluded all action with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or (ii) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the United States requesting the President’s
decision on the CFIUS notice submitted by Meridian and Columbus Holding and either (A) the period under the DPA during which the President
may announce his decision to take action to suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
has expired without any such action being taken, or (B) the President has announced a decision not to take any action to suspend, prohibit or place
any limitations on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The parties submitted a formal draft filing relating to the merger to CFIUS
on August 19, 2022, and received comments from CFIUS on August 30, 2022.
Foreign Regulatory Clearances. The parties have also filed merger notifications on August 19, 2022 pursuant to foreign antitrust and foreign
investment laws, and completion of the merger is further conditioned upon:
•
receipt of a clearance or non-objection from the German Federal Cartel Office and the Romanian Competition Council, or expiration of
the applicable waiting periods, or alternatively, if the matter is referred to the European Union, receipt of clearance or non-objection
from the European Union, or expiration of the applicable waiting period;
•
the approval or notification of non-objection to the merger from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy in the
United Kingdom under the UK National Security and Investment Act 2021; and
•
receipt of a certificate of non-objection from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action pursuant to the
German Foreign Trade and Payment Ordinance of 2 August 2013, as amended by Article 2 of the Ordinance of 25 August 2021.
At any time, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the laws of their jurisdictions, which could include
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seek to impose regulatory conditions on completion of the merger. Private parties may also seek to
take legal action under the antitrust laws
5Table of Contents
under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is
made, that it would not be successful. For more information about regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see the sections entitled “The Merger
(Proposal 1)—Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the
Merger.”
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances
and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the
imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or
obligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.",13,14

We expect to complete the merger in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. The merger is subject to various regulatory clearances and approvals and
other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Meridian, SDB or Columbus Holding could result in the merger being
completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We
expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.

As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the merger agreement, each party’s obligation to complete the merger depends on a number of
conditions being satisfied, including, without limitation:
•
adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of
Meridian common stock;
•
the absence of any injunction or order of any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction preventing completion of the merger in

which Meridian or SDB has material business operations;
•
the receipt of the regulatory clearances and approvals described under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Regulatory Clearances and
Approvals Required for the Merger”; and
•
making any other filing and obtaining any other permit imposed or required by any governmental entity in connection with the
completion of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, other than such filings and permits the
failure of which to be made or obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to Meridian and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or SDB and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
The obligations of Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub to effect the merger are also subject to the satisfaction (or valid waiver) of the following
conditions:
•
the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Meridian in the merger agreement (other than certain representations
described in the following bullets), subject to a material adverse effect standard;
•
certain of Meridian’s representations and warranties, among others, relating to Meridian’s organization and authorization, the financial
opinion provided by Rothschild & Co and brokers and finders, being true and correct in all material respects;
6Table of Contents

outstanding, being, in all but de minimis respects, true and correct;
•
performance in all material respects by Meridian of the agreements and covenants of Meridian in the merger agreement at or prior to the
closing;
•
the absence of a material adverse effect at Meridian since the date of the merger agreement that is continuing;
•
in relation to the United States DOJ’s ongoing investigation relating to the Magellan LeadCare product line, which we refer to as the
“DOJ Investigation,” Meridian has received the DOJ’s position of the potential liability Meridian may face as a result of the DOJ

•
the DOJ has not indicted Meridian or any of its subsidiaries on one or more felony criminal charges as result of the DOJ Investigation,
other than in connection with a negotiated resolution of the DOJ Investigation by Meridian in connection with the entry into or
proposed entry into a deferred prosecution agreement, and neither Meridian nor any of its subsidiaries has been excluded from any
Federal health care program (each of which events must continue to be ongoing for the failure of this condition to be asserted), and
neither of the events described in this bullet point is reasonably likely to occur.
The obligation of Meridian to effect the merger is also subject to the satisfaction (or valid waiver) of the following conditions:
•
the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub in the merger agreement (subject
generally to a material adverse effect standard, with different standards applicable to certain representations and warranties); and
•
performance in all material respects by Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub of the agreements and covenants of Columbus
Holding, SDB and Merger Sub in the merger agreement at or prior to the closing.",14,15

Subject to certain exceptions, Meridian has agreed that it will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce, knowingly assist or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the
submission or announcement by any person of, any proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be

furnish any information regarding Meridian or any of its subsidiaries to any person, or afford access to Meridian’s or its subsidiaries’

•
engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any takeover
proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any takeover proposal;
•
adopt, approve or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, purchase
agreement, or similar document, agreement, or commitment with respect to any takeover proposal, other than an acceptable
confidentiality agreement; or
•
agree to do any of the foregoing actions.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, neither Meridian nor any of its subsidiaries is prohibited from amending, modifying or granting any waiver or release
under any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement of
7Table of Contents
Meridian or any of its subsidiaries, but solely to the extent necessary to allow for a takeover proposal to be made to Meridian or the Meridian Board,
if the Meridian Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Meridian Board under applicable law.

not result from a material breach by Meridian of the non-solicitation covenant of the merger agreement or in certain other circumstances relating to
unforeseen material events, change its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement and, in the case of a superior proposal, may authorize
Meridian to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept the superior proposal, subject to complying with certain notice and other specified
conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including giving Columbus Holding the opportunity to make adjustments to the terms of the merger
agreement in response to the superior proposal so that such proposal no longer constitutes a superior proposal. If the Meridian Board changes its
recommendation with respect to the merger agreement, Columbus Holding may terminate the merger agreement and may request to collect a
termination fee of $45,960,000. For details regarding such termination fee, please refer to the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination

The merger agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the effective time by the mutual written consent of Meridian and
Columbus Holding.
The merger agreement may be terminated prior to the effective time by either Meridian or Columbus Holding if:
•
the merger has not been completed on or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 6, 2023 (the “outside date”) provided, however, that
(1) subject to certain conditions in the merger agreement, the outside date will automatically be extended to be 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time

the merger agreement in each case, where such breach primarily caused the failure to complete the merger;
•

prohibiting or making illegal the completion of the merger, such that the corresponding condition set forth in the merger agreement
cannot be satisfied; or

Meridian has agreed to pay to Columbus Holding a termination fee of $45,960,000 in cash, which we refer to as the “termination fee,” if the merger
agreement is terminated:
•
by Columbus Holding because the Meridian Board or committee thereof has made a change in recommendation (with such right of
termination exercisable by Columbus Holding for a period of 10 business days after such change in recommendation and prior to the
time at which Meridian shareholders adopt the merger agreement), or if either Columbus Holding or Meridian terminates the merger
agreement for any reason at such time as Columbus Holding could have terminated the merger agreement in the foregoing
circumstances described in this bullet point;
•
by Columbus Holding if Meridian has breached its non-solicitation covenants in the merger agreement described under “The Merger
Agreement—Non-Solicitation Covenant,” in a manner that would result in a failure of a condition to the completion of the merger, and
such breach is not cured prior to the earlier of the outside date and 30 days following Columbus Holding providing written notice to
Meridian stating its intention to terminate the merger agreement and the basis for such termination (except that Columbus Holding may
not terminate the merger agreement under these circumstances if it is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in the merger agreement);
•
by Meridian prior to the receipt of the shareholder approval for adoption of the merger agreement, in order to concurrently enter into an
acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal, provided that Meridian has complied with its non-solicitation covenants in
connection with such superior proposal in all material respects; or
9Table of Contents
•
by either Columbus Holding or Meridian under certain circumstances if the merger has not been completed on or before the outside
date or if the shareholders’ meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) concluded without obtaining the required
shareholder approval for adoption of the merger agreement, and in the case of any such termination (1) prior to such termination any
person publicly announces a takeover proposal or a takeover proposal becomes publicly known (which prior to such termination, in the
case of a termination due to the merger not being completed prior to the outside date, or at least three business days prior to the special
meeting, in the case of a termination due to shareholder approval of the adoption of the merger agreement not being obtained, has not
been withdrawn), and (2) at any time on or prior to the 12-month anniversary of such termination Meridian consummates a transaction
that constitutes a takeover proposal relating to 50% of Meridian’s shares or assets with the person that made the takeover proposal or
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a takeover proposal relating to 50% of Meridian’s shares or assets with the person
that made the takeover proposal.
In the case of termination by Columbus Holding, the termination fee shall be paid within two business days after such termination. In the case of
termination by Meridian, the termination fee shall be paid prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination; provided, however, in the case
of the last bullet above, Meridian will pay the termination fee upon the first to occur of the consummation of, or entry into a definitive agreement
with respect to, the applicable takeover proposal. In no event will Meridian be obligated to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion.
Columbus Holding’s receipt of the termination fee from Meridian will constitute liquidated damages, and from and after payment of such termination
fee, Meridian will not have further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with the merger agreement or the termination contemplated
thereby.",17,18

If the merger agreement is adopted by Meridian’s shareholders, Meridian shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and who properly demand payment of fair cash value of their shares are entitled to certain dissenters’ rights pursuant to Sections 1701.84
and 1701.85 of the OGCL. Section 1701.85 of the OGCL generally provides that Meridian shareholders will not be entitled to such rights without strict
compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, and failure to timely take any one of the required steps may result in the
termination or waiver of such rights. Specifically, any Meridian shareholder who is a record holder of Meridian common stock on September 2, 2022,
the record date for the special meeting, and whose shares are not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, may be entitled to be paid
the fair cash value of such shares after the completion of the merger in lieu of any applicable merger consideration.
To be entitled to such payment, a shareholder must, among other things, deliver to Meridian a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of
the shares held by such shareholder with the information provided for in Section 1701.85(A)(4) of the OGCL before the vote to adopt the merger
agreement is taken, not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and otherwise comply with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. A
shareholder’s failure to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of such shareholder’s dissenters’ rights as
long as such shareholder does not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. However, a proxy submitted but not marked to specify
voting instructions will be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and will be deemed a waiver of dissenters’ rights. Any written
demand must specify the
10Table of Contents
shareholder’s name and address, the number and class of shares held by him, her or it on the record date, and the amount claimed as the fair cash
value of such shares of common stock.
Shareholders holding Meridian common stock considering seeking payment of fair cash value of their shares should be aware that the fair cash
value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek payment of the fair cash value of their shares. For shares listed on a
national securities exchange (such as NASDAQ, on which the Meridian common stock is currently listed) immediately before the effective time of
the merger, the fair cash value will be the closing sale price of the shares as of the close of trading on the day before the vote of Meridian’s
shareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Dissenters’ Rights” and the text of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, which is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference, for more specific information on the procedures to be followed in
exercising dissenters’ rights. Shareholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect
to the exercise of dissenters’ rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process and because failure to follow fully and precisely the procedural
requirements of the statute may result in termination or waiver of such rights.

Certain executive officers of Meridian have arrangements that provide for severance payments or benefits, as well as other payments or
benefits upon completion of the merger and/or if their employment or service is terminated under certain circumstances in connection
with the merger.
•
The directors and executive officers of Meridian have rights to indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that will

Columbus Holding and Merger Sub have agreed that the surviving corporation will assume all identified rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time, that exist in favor of each present and former director or
officer of Meridian and each of its subsidiaries, and each person that is or was serving at the request of Meridian as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans
maintained or sponsored by Meridian, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators (each, an “indemnified party”).
Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub have agreed, and have agreed to cause the surviving company, to indemnify and hold harmless each
indemnified party with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), for six years after the effective time.
For a period of six years after the effective time, Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub will cause to be maintained (or provide substitute policies)
a six-year “tail policy” with reputable insurers on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Meridian and its subsidiaries as of the date of the merger

The following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a shareholder of Meridian, may have regarding the merger agreement, the merger, the
special meeting and the proposals being considered at the special meeting. Meridian urges you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement
and the full text of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, because the information in this section does not provide all the
information that might be important to you with respect to the merger agreement, the merger and the special meeting. Additional important
information is also contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
The Meridian Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of Meridian common stock in connection
with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the special meeting.
Q:
What is the purpose of the special meeting?
A:
At the special meeting, shareholders will consider and act upon the matters outlined in the notice of meeting on the cover page of this proxy
statement, namely:
•
the adoption of the merger agreement;
•
the approval of the compensation proposal; and
•
the approval of the adjournment proposal.
Q:
Where and when is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via the Internet on October 10, 2022 at 10 a.m., Eastern Time. We believe that hosting a virtual
meeting provides expanded access, improved communication and cost savings to our shareholders and Meridian, and aligns with our interests in
the health and safety of our shareholders and employees during this time when COVID-19 remains a concern. As such, the special meeting will be
held solely by means of remote communication rather than in person. You will be able to attend the special meeting online and to vote your shares
electronically at the special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VIVO2022SM.
Q:
How does the Meridian Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
A:
The Meridian Board unanimously recommends that you vote as follows:
•
“FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement;
•
“FOR” the approval of the compensation proposal; and
•
“FOR” the approval of the adjournment proposal.
Q:
What will happen in the merger?
A:
If the merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meridian, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Meridian
will be the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding. As a result of the merger, Meridian common stock will
no longer be publicly traded, and you will no longer have any interest in Meridian’s future earnings or growth. In addition, Meridian common stock
will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Meridian will no longer be required to file periodic reports with
the SEC with respect to Meridian common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.
13Table of Contents
Q:
Who will own Meridian after the merger?
A:
Immediately following the merger, Meridian will be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding. We anticipate that SDB will own
approximately 60% of Columbus Holding and SJL will control (directly or through its affiliate) a special purpose vehicle that will own approximately
40% of Columbus Holding.
Q:
What will I receive in the merger?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration of $34.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of
Meridian common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of Meridian common stock, you are entitled to receive $3,400.00 in cash
in exchange for your shares of Meridian common stock, without interest.
Q:
What will I receive in the merger in exchange for my equity awards?
A:
Stock Options. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Meridian common stock granted under the
Meridian stock plans, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Meridian common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price
per share of Meridian common stock set forth in such option. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days)
following the effective time.
Restricted Share Units. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian restricted share unit granted under the Meridian stock plans
will be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the number of
shares of Meridian common stock underlying the Meridian restricted share unit. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10
business days) following the effective time; provided, however, that the cash payments in respect of four restricted share unit grants made in
connection with Meridian’s acquisition of EUPROTEIN Inc. in April 2022 will not accelerate in connection with the merger and will be paid out in
substantially equal installments in accordance with the remaining vesting schedule.
Performance Share Units. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian performance share unit granted under the Meridian stock
plans will be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the
number of shares of Meridian common stock determined as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved for the measurement period at
the target level of performance. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days) following the effective time.
Q:
Am I entitled to dissenters’ rights instead of receiving the merger consideration?
A:
Under Ohio law, holders of record of Meridian common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly
demand payment of fair cash value of their shares are entitled to certain dissenters’ rights pursuant to Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL if
the merger is completed. Shareholders holding Meridian common stock considering seeking payment of the fair cash value of their shares should
be aware that the fair cash value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL could be more than, the same as, or less
than the value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek payment of fair cash value of their shares. To be
entitled to such payment, a shareholder must, among other things, deliver to Meridian a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of the
shares held by such shareholder with the information provided for in Section 1701.85(A)(4) of the OGCL before the vote to adopt the merger
agreement is taken, not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and otherwise comply with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Failing to
vote does not waive a dissenting shareholder’s dissenters’ rights. However, a proxy submitted but
14
Table of Contents
not marked to specify voting instructions will be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and will be deemed a waiver of dissenters’
rights. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL will result in the loss of dissenters’
rights. Please see the section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights” and the text of the Ohio dissenters’ rights statute, Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the
OGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their
entirety.
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the total outstanding shares of
Meridian common stock. A failure to vote your shares of Meridian common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the compensation proposal?
A:
Assuming a quorum of Meridian shareholders is present at the special meeting, approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of votes cast on the compensation proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to vote your shares
of Meridian common stock or abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the compensation proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
A:
Whether or not a quorum of Meridian shareholders is present at the special meeting, approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of votes cast on the adjournment proposal at the special meeting. If you fail to vote your shares of Meridian common stock or
abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal whether or not a quorum is present.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Meridian’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger?
A:
The SEC’s rules require Meridian to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will or may be made to
Meridian’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. For additional
information, see the section entitled “Advisory Vote on the Compensation Proposal (Proposal 2).”
Q:
What will happen if Meridian shareholders do not approve the compensation proposal?
A:
The vote to approve the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Approval of the
compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning that it will not be binding on
Meridian. Accordingly, while the Meridian Board intends to consider the vote resulting from this proposal, if the merger is completed, then the
compensation that is related to the merger will be payable to the extent that Meridian is contractually obligated to pay such compensation,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
In order to complete the merger, the following conditions to closing must be satisfied: (i) Meridian must obtain the shareholder approval for
adoption of the merger agreement, as described in this proxy statement, (ii) Meridian must receive the required regulatory approvals specified in the
merger agreement, (iii) the DOJ has not indicted Meridian or any of its subsidiaries on one or more felony criminal charges as result of the
15
Table of Contents
DOJ Investigation, other than in connection with a negotiated resolution of the DOJ Investigation by Meridian in connection with the entry into or
proposed entry into a deferred prosecution agreement, and neither Meridian nor any of its subsidiaries has been excluded from any Federal health
care program (each of which events must continue to be ongoing for the failure of this condition to be asserted), and neither of these two events
are reasonably likely to occur, and (iv) certain other closing conditions under the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived by the parties. The
parties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the merger in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, although Meridian cannot assure
completion by any particular date, if at all. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be
determined at this time.
Q:
Do you expect the merger to be taxable to Meridian shareholders?
A:
The exchange of Meridian common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should read
the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and consult your tax adviser regarding the particular tax
consequences of the merger to you, including any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is September 2, 2022. Only common shareholders of record at the close of business on that date, or their
duly appointed proxies, are entitled to attend virtually and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Each share of
Meridian common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting.
Q:
Who may attend the special meeting?
A:
Common shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting. “Street
name” holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee) should obtain a specific control number from, and follow the
instructions provided by, their broker, bank or other nominee.
We believe that hosting a virtual meeting provides expanded access, improved communication and cost savings to our shareholders and Meridian,
and aligns with our interests in the health and safety of our shareholders and employees during this time when COVID-19 remains a concern. As
such, the special meeting will be held solely by means of remote communication rather than in person. You will be able to attend the special meeting
online and to vote your shares electronically at the special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VIVO2022SM.
Q:
Who is soliciting my vote?
A:
The Meridian Board is soliciting your proxy, and Meridian will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Morrow Sodali LLC, which we refer to as “Morrow
Sodali,” has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Morrow Sodali will be paid a fee of approximately $25,000 and will be reimbursed
for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be
made by mail and email. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the
beneficial owners of shares of Meridian common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by Morrow Sodali or, without
additional compensation, by Meridian, or certain of Meridian’s directors, officers and employees.

Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including its annexes. Whether or
not you expect to attend the special meeting virtually, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may
be represented and voted at the special meeting. A failure to vote your shares of Meridian common stock or an abstention from voting will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?
A:
If you are a shareholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:
•
Internet: To vote over the internet, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote over the internet, you do not have to mail
in a proxy card.
•
Telephone: To vote by telephone, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in a
proxy card.
•
Mail: To vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly in the postage paid envelope provided. If you return your
signed proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.
•
Virtually: To vote virtually, attend the special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VIVO2022SM.
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting virtually, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the
meeting and vote virtually if you have already voted by proxy. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to vote
over the internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail.
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?
A:
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in “street name,” you will receive a voting instruction form
from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other
nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you
may change or revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:
•
You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before
your proxy is exercised at the special meeting;
•
You may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Meridian’s Vice President, Investor Relations at
mbi@meridianbioscience.com or 3471 River Hills Dr. Cincinnati, Ohio 45244 provided such written notice is received before your proxy is
exercised at the special meeting; or
•
You may attend the special meeting and revoke your proxy and vote virtually. Simply attending the special meeting virtually will not, by
itself, revoke your proxy.
If your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker or bank to change
or revoke your proxy.

Q:
If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the per share merger consideration for my shares of Meridian common stock?
A:
Following the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the
per share merger consideration. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for
the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates or book-entry shares for
the per share merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may
receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name”
shares in exchange for the per share merger consideration.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common stock now or with your proxy card.
If the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging
your shares of common stock for the per share merger consideration.
Q:
How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the special meeting?
A:
The presence at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of
a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Meridian to additional expense.
Q:
What if I abstain from voting?
A:
If you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Abstentions and a failure to vote your shares of Meridian common stock (including the failure of
a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a broker to give voting
instructions to the broker) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. However, if you fail to vote
your shares of Meridian common stock or abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the outcome of the compensation proposal (assuming a
quorum is present at the special meeting) or the adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting). For shares of
Meridian common stock held in “street name,” only shares of Meridian common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.

Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote by telephone, over the internet or virtually?
A:
If you are a registered shareholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote by telephone, over the internet or virtually, your shares
will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
If your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your broker may vote your shares at its discretion on
routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters. Under applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy
statement are non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name” and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your
shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
You will have the right to receive the merger consideration if the merger is adopted by the Meridian shareholders and subsequently completed even
if your shares are not voted at the special meeting.
Q:
What is a broker non-vote?
A:
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers that are present virtually or by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker is not
instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on
such proposal. Because brokers do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy
statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Meridian common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, then
those shares will not be present virtually or by proxy at the special meeting. Consequently, it is not expected that there will be any broker non-votes
present at the special meeting. Broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, the compensation
proposal. For shares of Meridian common stock held in “street name,” only shares of common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.
Q:
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record,
any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered
forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a
separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity
must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the
account. Please vote each and every proxy you receive to ensure all your accounts are voted.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
A:
This means you own shares of Meridian common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you
may own some shares directly as a shareholder of record and other shares through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker.
In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions
for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you
receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope
that accompanies that proxy card.

Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the special meeting virtually, we encourage you to send in your proxy card or to vote by telephone or over the internet.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
Meridian intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be
filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Meridian files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by the Meridian shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Meridian shareholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of Meridian common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Meridian will remain an
independent public company and shares of Meridian common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ. The merger agreement
provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Meridian may be required to pay to Columbus Holding the
termination fee. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Meridian” for a discussion of the circumstances
under which such a termination fee may be required to be paid.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about Meridian?
A:
Meridian will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2021 Annual Report to Shareholders, including
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, without charge to any shareholder who makes a written request to
Meridian’s Vice President, Investor Relations at mbi@meridianbioscience.com or 3471 River Hills Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. Meridian’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings may also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on Meridian’s Investor Relations website at
investor.meridianbioscience.com. Meridian’s website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or
accessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to
our website provided in this proxy statement.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another shareholder?
A:
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to
two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. Meridian and some brokers
may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple shareholders who request a copy and share an
address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in
householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you
wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or
Meridian if you are a shareholder of record by sending a written request to Meridian’s Vice President, Investor Relations at
mbi@meridianbioscience.com or 3471 River Hills Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244, or by calling (513) 271-3700. In addition, Meridian will promptly
deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.

statements are based on current beliefs and assumptions that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors, including, without limitation:
1.
Economic or other conditions in the markets in which Meridian operates, including those as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or the
Russia-Ukraine conflict;
2.
The timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals of the merger that could reduce
anticipated benefits or cause the parties to abandon the merger;
3.
The occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to a termination of the merger agreement, including the
possibility that Meridian’s shareholders may not adopt the merger agreement, the occurrence of a specified outcome of Meridian’s current
investigation by the United States Department of Justice, or the receipt of certain injunctions or orders making the completion of the merger
illegal;
4.
The risk that the parties to the merger agreement may not be able to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the merger in a timely
manner or at all;
5.
Risks related to distraction of Meridian’s management time from ongoing business operations due to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement;

The risk that Meridian may be adversely affected by other economic, business, or competitive factors;

The effect of the announcement of the transaction on the ability of Meridian to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships
with customers, suppliers and others with whom Meridian does business, or on Meridian’s operating results and business generally;
11.
Information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, and cybersecurity, malware
or ransomware attacks;
12.
Significant transaction costs related to the merger; and
13.
Liquidity challenges.
Additional factors that may affect the future results of Meridian are set forth in its filings with the SEC, including Meridian’s most recently filed Annual
Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, including the information contained under the caption “Risk Factors,” and
information in the consolidated
22Table of Contents
financial statements and notes thereto, as well as Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described
above are not exclusive and further information concerning Meridian and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect its
businesses, financial condition or operating results, may emerge from time to time. Should one or more of these or other known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by the
forward-looking statements included in this proxy statement or any document to which Meridian refers in this proxy statement. Therefore, you should not
place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this proxy statement speak only as of the date of

At the special meeting, Meridian shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)” and “The Merger Agreement” of this
proxy statement;
•
to approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis the compensation proposal, which is discussed under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)
—Interests of Meridian’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” of this proxy statement; and
•
to approve the adjournment proposal.
Meridian shareholders must adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If Meridian shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement, the merger
will not occur, and the Meridian shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Meridian common stock in connection with the merger.
Meridian does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If any other matters
are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have
discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.
Recommendation of the Meridian Board of Directors
After careful consideration, the Meridian board unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the
best interests of Meridian and its shareholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement; (iii) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by Meridian; (iv) directed that the merger
agreement be submitted to the Meridian shareholders for adoption; and (v) recommended that Meridian shareholders adopt the merger agreement.

will constitute a quorum. Any shares of Meridian common stock held by Meridian or by any of its subsidiaries are not considered to be outstanding for
purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting; provided that Meridian shareholders
present in person or by proxy, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn the meeting without notice, other than by announcement at the meeting.
Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Meridian to additional
expense. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any

An abstention occurs when a shareholder of record attends a meeting, virtually or by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special meeting, abstentions
will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Abstentions and a failure to vote your shares of Meridian common stock (including the
failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a
26Table of Contents
broker to give voting instructions to the broker) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. However,
abstentions or a failure to vote your Meridian common stock will have no effect on the outcome of the compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is
present at the special meeting) or the adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting). For shares of Meridian common
stock held in “street name,” only shares of common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be counted as a
vote in favor of such proposal.
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be

Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers that are present virtually or by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker is not
instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such
proposal. Meridian does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only
provide them with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the special
meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of Meridian common stock at the
special meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or, assuming a quorum is

any difficulties accessing the virtual special meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on

your control number, please contact the bank, broker or other organization that holds your shares. Please note that if your shares of Meridian common
stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the special meeting and did not obtain a control number, you must contact
your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number to vote your shares by ballot at the special meeting.
You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the proxy card by mail, through the internet, or
by telephone. Although Meridian offers four different voting
27Table of Contents
methods, Meridian encourages you to vote over the internet or by phone as Meridian believes they are the most cost-effective methods. We also
recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the special meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. Both the
internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over
the internet or by telephone, there is no need for you to mail back your proxy card.
To Vote Over the Internet:
Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the special meeting. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
October 9, 2022. Once you enter the Internet voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions. If you have any questions
about www.proxyvote.com, please contact the bank, broker, or other organization that holds your shares. If you vote over the internet, you do not have to
mail in a proxy card.
To Vote By Telephone:
Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours a day in the United States until 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on October 9, 2022. Once you enter the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change)
your voting instructions. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in a proxy card.
To Vote By Proxy Card:
If you received a proxy card, mark your voting instructions on the card, complete and sign the proxy card and mail it to the address indicated on the proxy
card.
If you sign and return your signed proxy card without indicating how you want your shares of Meridian common stock to be voted with regard to a
particular proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but do not indicate a choice on the
compensation proposal or adjournment proposal, your shares of Meridian common stock will be voted in favor of each such proposal. Proxy cards that
are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting and cannot be voted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee
seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide
or revoke your instructions. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by
following the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
Revocation of Proxies
Any proxy given by a Meridian shareholder may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by doing any of the following:
•
if a proxy was submitted by telephone or through the Internet, by submitting another proxy by telephone or through the Internet, in
accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Special Meeting—Voting at the Special
Meeting” at any time before your proxy is exercised at the special meeting;
•
by delivering a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to Meridian’s Vice President, Investor
Relations at 3471 River Hills Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio 45244, stating that the proxy is revoked, provided such written notice is received before
your proxy is exercised at the special meeting;
28
Table of Contents
•
by submitting a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares of Meridian common stock; or
•
by attending the special meeting and voting virtually (your attendance at the special meeting virtually will not, by itself, revoke your proxy;
you must vote virtually at the special meeting).
“Street name” holders of Meridian common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to revoke or
change their proxies.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Meridian, with Meridian surviving the
merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Meridian common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive cash
without interest in the amount of $34.00, subject to any required tax withholding. At the effective time, all of the shares of Meridian common stock will
cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and each certificate or book entry formerly representing any of the shares of Meridian
common stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will thereafter represent only the right to receive the per share merger consideration of
$34.00 for each such share upon surrender of either a stock certificate formerly representing such share or a book-entry share in the manner provided in
the merger agreement.
Each excluded share will no longer be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no payment or other consideration will be made with
respect to such shares.
Each share of common stock, without par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value per share, of the surviving company in the merger
and, thereafter, will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving company in the merger.
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Meridian common stock granted under the Meridian stock plans,
whether vested or unvested, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Meridian common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share of Meridian
common stock set forth in such option. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days) following the effective time.
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian restricted share unit granted under the Meridian stock plans will be converted into a right to
receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the number of shares of Meridian common stock
underlying such Meridian restricted share unit. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days) following the effective
time; provided, however, that the cash payments in respect of four restricted share unit grants made in connection with Meridian’s acquisition of
EUPROTEIN Inc. in April 2022 will not accelerate in connection with the merger and will be paid out in substantially equal installments in accordance with
the remaining vesting schedule.
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian performance share unit granted under the Meridian stock plans will be converted into a right
to receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the number of shares of Meridian common stock
determined as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved for the measurement period at the target level of performance. Such cash payments

MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,Effects on Meridian if the Merger Is Not Completed,"Effects on Meridian if the Merger Is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not adopted by the Meridian shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Meridian shareholders will
not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, Meridian will remain an independent public company. In addition, if the
merger is not completed, Meridian expects that management will operate Meridian’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated
today and that Meridian shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including,
without limitation, risks related to the competitive industry in which Meridian operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely that
the price of Meridian common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Meridian common stock would
return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares
of Meridian common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Meridian Board will continue to evaluate and review Meridian’s business operations,
properties, dividend policy and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify
strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. If the merger agreement is not adopted by the Meridian shareholders or if the merger is not completed
for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Meridian will be offered or that Meridian’s business, prospects
or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, Meridian may be required to pay Columbus Holding a termination fee in
an amount equal to $45,960,000. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Meridian” for details.
Background of the Merger",40,40
MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of its ongoing evaluation of Meridian’s long-term strategic plans and goals, the Meridian Board and Meridian’s senior management periodically
review and assess Meridian’s business, operations and financial performance, as well as the general state of the industries Meridian operates in, as they
may affect those plans and goals. Such review and assessment has included, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for
mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, and other financial and strategic alternatives, some of which were proposed to Meridian from
time to time by third parties on an unsolicited basis. In late 2019, Meridian began to consider the acquisition of Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. (which was
announced on February 19, 2020) and the Meridian Board began to monitor whether Meridian could become subject to unsolicited takeover attempts or
activist trading as a result of a decline in its stock price during 2019. In order to assist with the review and assessment of potential strategic and business
alternatives, including the Exalenz acquisition, and evaluation of Meridian’s market trading, and their financial implications, Meridian engaged Rothschild
& Co as Meridian’s financial advisor. On December 2, 2019, Meridian and Rothschild & Co entered into a letter agreement governing such engagement.
The Meridian Board selected Rothschild & Co to serve as Meridian’s financial advisor due to, among other things, Rothschild & Co’s extensive
experience in Meridian’s industry and its familiarity with Meridian’s business, together with the business of other strategic companies and financial
sponsors that could be interested in acquiring Meridian.
Between December 2019 and April 2021, various financial sponsors periodically reached out to Meridian’s management and expressed interest in various
business collaborations or potential strategic transactions with Meridian. In a number of those outreaches, the financial sponsors asked to partner with
Meridian to acquire other companies or businesses.
In early April 2021, “Party A,” a financial sponsor with whom Meridian’s management had periodically had informal contacts during the previous months,
reached out to Meridian’s management to discuss its interest in acquiring Meridian’s diagnostics business.
32Table of Contents
On April 26 and April 27, 2021, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian’s management, representatives of Rothschild & Co
and representatives of Keating Muething & Klekamp PLL, which we refer to as “KMK,” Meridian’s long-standing outside corporate legal counsel, were
present. At the meeting, representatives from Rothschild & Co reviewed the outreach from Party A, the strategic transaction proposed by Party A
involving a sale of Meridian’s diagnostics business, and a preliminary financial analysis. The Meridian Board also discussed then existing market
dynamics and the increase in value attributed to companies in the life science sector, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the
Meridian Board expressed the view that Meridian was not for sale at that time and that the Meridian Board was optimistic about Meridian’s standalone
strategy and its prospects in the near and long-term, consistent with the exercise of its business judgement and fiduciary duties, the Meridian Board
determined that if it were presented with a proposal that it believed was in the best interests of Meridian and its shareholders, which would likely need to
provide for an acquisition of the entire company, then the Meridian Board would consider such an offer. To that effect, the Meridian Board instructed
Meridian’s management to work with Rothschild & Co to perform a market check involving Party A and identified other financial sponsors to inquire
whether they would have an interest in acquiring Meridian and, if so, to obtain an indication of the purchase price and other terms such parties would
offer. We refer to this process as the “2021 market check.” Meridian refrained from including strategic operating companies in the 2021 market check at
that time, because, up to that time, Meridian had only been contacted by financial sponsors and had not had any interactions with strategic companies
that had expressed any interest in a potential acquisition of the company or other potential strategic transactions. In addition, the Meridian Board
believed that strategic parties would not be interested in an acquisition of the whole company, including because of the disparate nature of the
diagnostics and life science business.
Accordingly, in June 2021 and the following weeks, representatives of Rothschild & Co reached out to five other financial sponsors to inquire whether
they would have an interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction with Meridian. Mr. Jack Kenny, Meridian’s Chief Executive Officer, and other
members of Meridian’s senior management had introductory meetings with representatives of four of those financial sponsors and with representatives
of Party A. In each of those meetings, Mr. Kenny and the other members of Meridian’s senior management provided a high-level overview of Meridian’s
businesses based on publicly available information.
On July 28, 2021, representatives of Rothschild & Co had a call with Party A. Party A indicated that it may be interested in an acquisition of all of
Meridian, rather than just its diagnostic business, but that to do so it would propose to partner with another financial sponsor, Party B. Following the
introductory meetings, Meridian’s management, prepared a management presentation and financial projections for Meridian. Party A, Party B and “Party
C,” another financial sponsor contacted during the 2021 market check, entered into confidentiality agreements with Meridian, and in August 2021,
Meridian provided the management presentations and the financial projections to those three parties. Afterwards, Meridian’s management held additional
meetings with those parties to provide additional information regarding Meridian’s businesses.
On September 14, 2021, Party C submitted a non-binding indicative proposal to acquire Meridian for $26.00 per share in cash. On September 14, 2021,
Meridian’s closing stock price was $19.60 per share. The other parties contacted in the 2021 market check, including Party A and Party B, ultimately
declined to submit any proposals for the acquisition of Meridian.
On September 16, 2021, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian’s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co and
KMK were present. At this meeting, the Meridian Board reviewed and discussed with Meridian’s management, and the representatives from Rothschild
& Co and KMK the indicative proposal submitted by Party C and the broader outcome of the 2021 market check, including the fact that no other party
had provided a proposal to acquire Meridian, and Meridian’s current strategy, plan and prospects as a standalone company. Following such discussions,
the Meridian Board concluded that Party C’s proposal undervalued Meridian and, in consultation with Rothschild & Co, determined that it was very
unlikely that Party C would improve its proposal to a purchase price that would be acceptable to the Meridian Board or that any of the other parties
contacted in the 2021 market check would submit a proposal to acquire Meridian. Therefore, the Meridian Board decided to not engage further with Party
C or any of the other parties at that time.

In December 2021, representatives from Piper Sandler & Co., which we refer to as “Piper Sandler,” contacted Mr. Kenny to discuss a potential strategic
opportunity for Meridian. On December 20, 2021, members of Meridian’s senior management, including Mr. Kenny, held an initial call with representatives
of Piper Sandler who indicated that a Korean party was interested in speaking with Meridian about potential business collaboration opportunities. In
subsequent conversations with representatives of Piper Sandler, Meridian’s management learned that such Korean party was SDB, and that SDB was
partnering with SJL to inquire as to whether Meridian was interested in considering strategic or business opportunities. On January 4, 2022, Meridian,
SDB and SJL executed a confidentiality agreement. We refer to SDB and SJL collectively as the “buyer consortium.”
On January 11, 2022, Mr. Kenny and other members of Meridian’s senior management held an introductory meeting with representatives of the buyer
consortium, including Dr. Young Shik Cho, Chairman of SDB, Mr. Steve Sukjung Lim, Chairman and Managing Partner of SJL, and Mr. Sungjae Lee,
Managing Director of SJL. During this conversation, the representatives of the buyer consortium expressed a strong interest in some type of transaction
or collaboration with Meridian, possibly a joint venture, a distribution partnership or an acquisition of Meridian. Meridian’s management made clear in
that meeting that Meridian was not actively seeking to initiate a sales process for Meridian. At the conclusion of the meeting, the representatives of the
buyer consortium requested additional conversations to learn more about Meridian’s business operations and in order to determine what type of
transaction or collaboration, if any, the buyer consortium might want to propose.
On January 26, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian’s management and representatives of KMK, were present.
During such meeting, Mr. Kenny provided a summary of the introductory meeting of Meridian’s management team with representatives of the buyer
consortium. The Meridian Board then discussed with Meridian’s management team the possible strategic opportunities and instructed Meridian’s
management to further explore whether the buyer consortium was interested in an acquisition transaction, distribution partnership, joint venture or other
type of transaction. During the discussion with Meridian’s management team regarding potential next steps, the Meridian Board expressed the view that
Meridian was not for sale at that time and that the Meridian Board was optimistic about Meridian’s standalone strategy and its prospects in the near and
long-term, but, consistent with the exercise of its business judgement and fiduciary duties, if the Meridian Board were presented with an acquisition offer
that it believed was in the best interests of Meridian and its shareholders, then the Meridian Board would consider such an offer. The Meridian Board
also requested that Meridian’s management be judicious in the use of its time engaging in discussions with the buyer consortium in order to avoid
creating significant distractions from the day-to-day operation of Meridian’s business.
On February 3, 2022, Mr. Kenny and other members of Meridian’s management team held additional conversations via telephone with representatives of
the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler to convey the message of the Meridian Board that Meridian was not for sale and that the Meridian Board had
concerns about distractions for Meridian’s management. The representatives of the buyer consortium provided additional details regarding SDB’s
business and indicated that they believed, based on the initial conversations, that Meridian would be a good strategic fit for the buyer consortium. At the
conclusion of this meeting, the representatives of the buyer consortium expressed its preference for an acquisition of Meridian’s whole business, rather
than a collaboration, distribution arrangement or acquisition of just certain assets or one of the business units, and requested an in-person meeting in
mid-February 2022 to further discuss the buyer consortium’s interest. Following this conversation, Mr. Kenny informed John McIlwraith, the Chairman of
the Meridian Board, about the outcome of the meeting and the buyer consortium’s interest in acquiring the entire company. Mr. McIlwraith then
convened a call with the Meridian Board to discuss the buyer consortium’s interest and the desirability of an in-person meeting.
Following those conversations, on February 14, 2022, members of Meridian’s management consisting of Mr. Kenny, Mr. Tony Serafini-Lamanna,
Executive Vice President, Diagnostics, Mr. Charles Wood, Vice President—Corporate Strategy, Business Development & Investor Relations, and Ms. Julie
Smith, Senior Vice President, Controller & Principal Accounting Officer held a meeting with representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler and
also provided a tour of Meridian’s facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio. At this
34
Table of Contents
meeting, the representatives of the buyer consortium expressed that Meridian was a strong strategic fit with SDB and its affiliate BioNote, and for that
reason, the buyer consortium intended to submit a non-binding expression of interest for the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of
Meridian. At this meeting, Mr. Kenny reiterated that Meridian was not for sale, but that he would bring the buyer consortium’s expression of interest to
the Meridian Board for consideration.
On March 3, 2022, at Meridian’s request, the buyer consortium executed a new confidentiality agreement with Meridian on a form prepared by KMK. Mr.
Kenny had informed Mr. McIlwraith about the execution of a new confidentiality agreement, which Meridian’s management deemed preferable before
engaging in further discussions with the buyer consortium. This new form included a customary standstill provision that would fall away if Meridian
entered into a definitive agreement providing for, among other things, a merger following which Meridian shareholders would own less than 50% of the
voting securities of the surviving company. On March 5, 2022, members of Meridian’s management provided the buyer consortium with the financial
projections for Meridian that were used in connection with the 2021 market check, but updated for Meridian’s actual financial performance for those
periods that had then transpired. We refer to these financial projections as the “Preliminary Meridian projections.”
On March 18, 2022, the buyer consortium submitted a written, non-binding proposal (the “indicative proposal”) to Meridian under which the buyer
consortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price in the range of $31.00 to $33.00 per share in cash. On March 17,
2022, the closing price of the Meridian common stock was $25.67 per share. The indicative proposal stated that the acquisition would be completed
through a to be formed entity that would be owned approximately 60% by SDB and approximately 40% by SJL and that the offer was not subject to any
financing contingencies as the buyer consortium had sufficient financial resources to consummate the proposed transaction. In its indicative proposal,
the buyer consortium indicated additional key diligence materials that it would need to review to make a definitive proposal to acquire Meridian and noted
that the valuation range reflected the buyer consortium’s limited insight into the growth assumptions underlying the Preliminary Meridian projections.
The indicative proposal stated that if the buyer consortium could gain greater conviction regarding the Preliminary Meridian projections it could
potentially offer a higher price.
Shortly after Meridian’s receipt of the indicative proposal, representatives of Piper Sandler reached out to representatives of Rothschild & Co to discuss
the content of the indicative proposal and to ask about Meridian’s reaction to the indicative proposal.
On March 21, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian’s management, and representatives of Rothschild & Co and
KMK were present. At the meeting, representatives of KMK provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties under Ohio law in the context of their
consideration of a proposal to acquire Meridian. Mr. Kenny then summarized the indicative proposal, as well as previous interactions described above
between Meridian’s senior management and representatives of the buyer consortium. The Meridian Board discussed the indicative proposal and
potential responses, considering Meridian’s standalone plan, the uncertainty and challenges created by the current economic environment, and the
uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as potential short- and long-term execution risks to Meridian’s financial plan. Representatives of
Rothschild & Co reviewed their preliminary perspectives on the financial aspects of the indicative proposal. The representatives of Rothschild & Co
expressed the view that, from their initial review, the buyer consortium represented a credible group capable of completing a transaction of this size. The
Meridian Board discussed potential next steps and directed Meridian’s senior management to work with Rothschild & Co and KMK to further evaluate
the indicative proposal from a financial and legal perspective. The Meridian Board instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co to respond to the
buyer consortium that the indicative proposal did not sufficiently value Meridian, but that the Meridian Board would agree to provide the additional key
due diligence information that had been requested so that the buyer consortium could increase its offer.
Following such meeting, on March 22, 2022, the representatives of Rothschild & Co contacted representatives of Piper Sandler to clarify the details of the
indicative proposal, including key diligence information requested
35
Table of Contents
therein, to request further information relevant to transaction certainty, to convey the decision of the Meridian Board that the indicative proposal did not
sufficiently value Meridian and to seek confirmation that the buyer consortium was willing and able to increase the purchase price above the price range
included in the indicative proposal.
On March 25, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian’s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co and
KMK were present. In this meeting, representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed their preliminary analysis of Meridian and the indicative proposal and
their discussions with representatives of Piper Sandler. The representatives of Rothschild & Co reported further that the buyer consortium, through Piper
Sandler, had clarified the financial data and projections that it was seeking from Meridian and indicated that on the basis of updated projections,
additional information providing confidence that the underlying assumptions used in preparation of those projections were reasonable, and the receipt of
additional financial and business diligence, including additional information regarding Meridian’s life science business and strategy, a further indicative
offer would likely be at the higher end of the $31.00 to $33.00 per share range.
Following this discussion, the Meridian Board instructed Meridian’s management to inform the buyer consortium that the Meridian Board had considered
the indicative proposal, that Meridian was not actively in a process to sell the company, and that the indicative proposal did not sufficiently value
Meridian. The Meridian Board also instructed Meridian’s management to indicate that the Meridian Board would, together with Meridian’s management
team and its outside advisors, analyze an improved offer from the buyer consortium. The Meridian Board further instructed Meridian’s management and
representatives of Rothschild & Co to provide the key diligence information, including the updated management financial projections, requested by the
buyer consortium in the indicative proposal so that the buyer consortium would be in a position to improve the indicative proposal.
In the same meeting, in order to provide a more efficient process for engaging with Meridian’s legal and financial advisors on day-to-day aspects of the
engagement with buyer consortium, the Meridian Board formed and authorized a special committee of the Meridian Board, comprised of Mr. Anthony P.
Bihl, Ms. Felicia Williams and Mr. John McIlwraith (the “special committee”), to act on behalf of the Meridian Board and Meridian in connection with the
proposal by the buyer consortium and any other proposals to acquire the company, subject to continuing oversight by the full Meridian Board and
without the power to approve a definitive transaction, which was reserved for the full Meridian Board.
Subsequent to the meeting, Meridian’s senior management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information of Meridian, which were derived
from the projections for Meridian’s business used during the 2021 market check and from regular updates regarding Meridian’s financial conditions and
prospects that had been provided by Meridian’s management to the Meridian Board at prior meetings, and which we refer to as the “Updated Meridian
projections.” As a result, the Meridian Board was familiar with the framework underlying the Updated Meridian projections that were later provided to the
buyer consortium. Please see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Certain Financial Projections” for further information relating to a summary
of the Updated Meridian projections.
On March 28, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co informed representatives of Piper Sandler that Meridian would be willing to engage with the buyer
consortium on a limited basis by providing the additional key financial diligence information requested, including Meridian management financial
projections, and making members of Meridian management available to meet with senior representatives of the buyer consortium, with the expectation
that the buyer consortium would respond with an improved proposal, including robust deal certainty assurances. Following such conversation, on April
5, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co provided representatives of Piper Sandler with the Updated Meridian projections that had been prepared by
Meridian’s management.
On April 7, 2022, Meridian’s management provided a detailed presentation to representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler, including a
review of Meridian’s strategy for its life science and diagnostics
36
Table of Contents
business units and a discussion of the framework for potential synergies between Meridian and SDB and its subsidiaries. Representatives of Rothschild
& Co also attended. During this meeting, Meridian’s management reiterated that the current proposal from the buyer consortium was not acceptable to
the Meridian Board.
On April 11, 2022, representatives from Meridian’s management team met again with representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler to discuss
some of the assumptions underlying the Updated Meridian projections. Representatives of Rothschild & Co also attended. During this meeting,
representatives of the buyer consortium requested more detailed historical financial information for Meridian’s business.
On April 13, the special committee engaged Jones Day to represent Meridian, the special committee and the Meridian Board in connection with the
potential sale of Meridian. The special committee selected Jones Day to serve as Meridian’s legal advisor in connection with the potential transaction due
to, among other things, Jones Day’s extensive experience in Meridian’s industry and qualifications and deep expertise in merger transactions and the
other matters that were to be considered by the Meridian Board.
Later in the day, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian’s senior management and representatives of Rothschild & Co, KMK
and Jones Day were present. Meridian’s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co summarized for the special committee the most recent
interactions with the representatives of buyer consortium and Piper Sandler, and Mr. Kenny described the additional diligence requests made by the
buyer consortium. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reported that the representatives of Piper Sandler had advised them that upon receipt of the
additional information, the buyer consortium would be better enabled to justify and present a higher price range in a revised offer.
On April 14, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co contacted representatives of Piper Sandler to inform them that the Meridian Board was expecting a
revised proposal from the buyer consortium that would include an increase in price based on the parties’ discussions of the Updated Meridian
projections and underlying assumptions, and was seeking assurances that any remaining diligence requests would be limited.
On April 15, 2022, the buyer consortium submitted a written, non-binding proposal (the “revised proposal”) to Meridian under which the buyer
consortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price in the range of $33.50 to 34.00 per share in cash. On April 14, 2022,
the closing price of the Meridian common stock was $27.94. The revised proposal again confirmed that the offer was not subject to any financing
contingencies, as SDB had sufficient financial resources to consummate the proposed transaction, and that although the transaction would be effected
through a to be newly formed joint venture entity of SDB and SJL, SDB would fully backstop the obligations of the buyer consortium under the definitive
merger agreement. The revised proposal indicated the buyer consortium’s expectation that consummation of the proposed transaction would be
conditioned solely on receipt of the requisite approval the Meridian shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals, including from the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States, and customary antitrust clearances from necessary jurisdictions. The buyer consortium indicated its confidence
that approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States would not likely be an impediment to completion of the transaction. The
revised proposal reiterated the buyer consortium’s view that the diligence information provided by Meridian to date had continued to provide the buyer
consortium with limited insight into the drivers of the growth assumptions underlying the Updated Meridian projections as well as product line
profitability and indicated that access to further due diligence information requested in the revised proposal could allow the buyer consortium to provide
a specific proposed purchase price, rather than the revised offer price range.
Later in the day, the Meridian Board held a meeting at which members of Meridian’s senior management and representatives of Rothschild & Co, Jones
Day and KMK were present, to discuss the revised proposal in detail. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed the terms of the revised proposal
and its preliminary financial analysis of Meridian relative to the revised proposal. The Meridian Board, along with representatives of Jones Day and
Rothschild & Co then discussed issues of transaction certainty, the remaining due diligence information requested by the buyer consortium, and the
buyer consortium’s sources of funds, noting that SJL indicated it

would seek to raise funds from current investors in addition to the $1.6 billion of cash SDB held at that time. Following this discussion, the consensus of
the Meridian Board was that the revised proposal was not sufficiently compelling to warrant further negotiations with the buyer consortium. The
Meridian Board directed representatives of Rothschild & Co to advise the buyer consortium of the Meridian Board’s decision to reject the $33.50 to
$34.00 per share range as a basis for further negotiations, but also communicate that the Meridian Board would be open to the buyer consortium’s
highest and best proposal.
On April 16, 2022, after representatives of Rothschild & Co conveyed the Meridian Board’s decision to reject the revised proposal, a representative of
Piper Sandler sent an email to representatives of Rothschild & Co stating that based on the information previously provided by Meridian, the buyer
consortium was not in a position to further increase the purchase price and was therefore terminating the discussions. The representative of Piper Sandler
stressed that the buyer consortium’s strategic motivation remained strong and that they were disappointed that a transaction was not possible at that
time.
On April 18, 2022, Mr. McIlwraith discussed Piper Sandler’s message with the other members of the special committee, Mr. Kenny, and representatives of
Rothschild & Co and Jones Day. Based on those discussions, the special committee determined to not change the Meridian Board’s decision with respect
to the revised proposal. Mr. McIlwraith instructed representatives of Rothschild & Co to convey to representatives of Piper Sandler that Meridian’s
position remained unchanged and discuss with them whether there was a way to continue the discussions with the buyer consortium. Separately, Mr.
Kenny called Mr. Lim to reiterate the special committee’s position and discuss perceived differences in valuation. At the conclusion of this conversation,
Mr. Lim indicated he would reconsider and explore internally whether the buyer consortium could revert with a higher price range.
On April 22, 2022, the buyer consortium submitted a further revised written, non-binding proposal (the “further revised proposal”) to Meridian, under
which the buyer consortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price in the range of $34.00 to $35.00 per share in cash.
On April 21, 2022, the closing price of the Meridian common stock was $27.35. The further revised proposal was conditioned on the express
understanding that the buyer consortium would receive the previously requested due diligence information and that the buyer consortium would be able
to achieve a sufficient level of comfort that the Updated Meridian projections are reasonable and achievable on a stand-alone basis. In the further revised
proposal, the buyer consortium requested that Meridian agree to a 40-day period during which Meridian would negotiate exclusively with the buyer
consortium regarding a sale transaction.
On April 26, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting at which members of Meridian’s senior management, and representatives of Rothschild & Co, Jones
Day, and KMK were present. At this meeting, the representatives of Jones Day discussed with the directors their fiduciary duties in the context of a
potential strategic transaction. Meridian’s senior management, and representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co then reviewed with the Meridian
Board the further revised proposal in detail. The representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of Meridian relative to the
financial terms of the further revised proposal. After a discussion among the Meridian Board, Meridian’s senior management and its advisors regarding
the current status of discussions with the buyer consortium, the deal structure and the timeline of the possible transaction, the Meridian Board decided
that in light of the revised offer range, Meridian should provide the requested further due diligence materials to the buyer consortium. The Meridian
Board also discussed the buyer consortium’s request that Meridian agree to a 40-day exclusivity period. Consistent with the previous decision of the
Meridian Board to not enter into exclusive negotiations with the buyer consortium, the Meridian Board determined that it would be more advantageous
for Meridian and its shareholders and consistent with the Meridian Board’s exercise of its business judgement and fiduciary duties for Meridian to not
enter into an exclusivity agreement with the buyer consortium at that point.
Following such meeting of the Meridian Board, representatives of Rothschild & Co conveyed to representatives of Piper Sandler the decisions taken by
the Meridian Board in response to the further revised proposal, including that in light of the revised offer range, Meridian would provide the requested
further due diligence materials to the buyer consortium, but continued to reject the buyer consortium’s request to enter into an exclusivity agreement with
the buyer consortium.

On May 23, 2022 and May 24, 2022, Meridian’s management provided further presentations to representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler.
Representatives of Rothschild & Co also attended. Topics covered included operations, R&D, and strategy of the diagnostics and life science
businesses, description of Meridian’s human resources and regulatory capabilities, and details and assumptions underlying financial projections.
Additionally, Meridian management and Jones Day presented details on the status and chronology of the DOJ Investigation relating to the Magellan
LeadCare product line. Representatives of Paul Hastings were present during the May 23, 2022 presentation.
On May 25, 2022, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings LLP, which we refer to as “Paul Hastings,” the buyer consortium’s legal advisor in connection
with the potential transaction, a draft merger agreement governing the proposed acquisition of Meridian by the buyer consortium.
In the period from May 26, 2022 through June 23, 2022, members of the Meridian management team and representatives of Jones Day, Rothschild & Co
and KMK held due diligence sessions with representatives of the buyer consortium, Paul Hastings and Piper Sandler on various topics, including
financial, commercial and tax, the DOJ Investigation, trade and export control and other regulatory aspects of the proposed transaction, information
technology and cybersecurity, data privacy, human resources and employee benefits.
From June 1, 2022 through June 3, 2022, Mr. Kenny, Mr. Andrew Kitzmiller, Meridian’s Chief Financial Officer and other members of Meridian’s senior
management visited SDB’s headquarters in South Korea. The discussions during this visit were focused on SDB’s and BioNote’s businesses and to
further assess the buyer consortium’s capabilities. Representatives of the buyer consortium also conducted a visit of SDB’s and BioNote’s facilities with
Meridian’s management team and discussed the operating plan for the combined businesses going forward. During the course of these meetings,
representatives of SJL requested that certain members of management agree to reinvest into the buyer a portion of the proceeds they would receive in
connection with an acquisition of Meridian by the buyer consortium. The members of Meridian’s senior management indicated that they would be
interested in remaining with Meridian in a long term role and would also be interested in potentially investing in Meridian, but that they could not agree
to any proposals or arrangements at that time.
On June 6, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian’s senior management team, and representatives of Rothschild & Co
and Jones Day were present. At the meeting, Meridian’s senior management team provided to the special committee an update on their visit to SDB’s
headquarters in South Korea. Representatives of Rothschild & Co provided an update of the buyer consortium’s diligence process and anticipated
completion thereof. The special committee then discussed performing a further market check in advance of signing a definitive agreement with the buyer
consortium. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed with the special committee a list of certain potential strategic and financial buyers that had
been previously discussed with Meridian’s senior management, and Meridian’s prior outreach to some of these parties in connection with the 2021 market
check. The potential buyers on this list were selected based on their perceived likely interest in an acquisition of Meridian, and financial capability to
complete a deal, as well as existing experience and activity in the industry, including taking into account that the transaction proposed by the buyer
consortium was for all of Meridian and certain parties may only be interested in Meridian’s life science business or diagnostics business. After
consulting with Meridian’s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co, the special committee instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co
to contact a specified subset of the potential parties and balancing the risk that reaching out to parties that may not be interested in, or able to complete a
transaction with Meridian could put the sale process at risk if it was made public. The special committee then discussed: the risk of potential leaks; the
potential that the buyer consortium would disengage if it learned that Meridian was in discussions with third parties; a no shop provision that the buyer
consortium would likely require to be included in a definitive agreement; a termination fee that would likely be included in a definitive agreement; and the
ability of potential acquirors to make offers after a definitive agreement has been signed and announced. The special committee determined that it was in
Meridian’s and its shareholders’ best
interest to authorize the representatives of Rothschild & Co to conduct a market check with the identified parties
39
Table of Contents
and instructed them to reach out to these parties, which comprised seven financial sponsors and six strategic operating companies. Rothschild & Co
promptly began its market check efforts on behalf of Meridian.
On June 10, Jones Day received a revised draft of the merger agreement from Paul Hastings. Among other items, this draft included a request by the
buyer consortium for certain members of Meridian’s management to enter into employment agreements with Meridian concurrently with the execution of
the merger agreement and to reinvest into buyer a portion of the proceeds they would receive in connection with an acquisition of Meridian by the buyer
consortium.
On June 13, Jones Day discussed with Meridian’s management the key issues arising from the revised draft of the merger agreement provided by the
buyer consortium as well as potential reactions and responses.
On June 15, 2022, as part of a status update call between the parties, Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller discussed with Messrs. Lim and Lee some of the
material issues identified by Jones Day in the revised draft of the merger agreement provided by Paul Hastings. Among the topics discussed were the
potential treatment of the ongoing DOJ Investigation in the merger agreement, potential insurance coverage for the financial outcome of the DOJ
Investigation, maintenance of broad-based employee benefits plans post-closing, treatment of all equity awards in connection with a transaction, and
reconfirming that the transaction will not be subject to any financing contingencies. Messrs. Lim and Lee confirmed that the buyer consortium intended
to deliver its binding offer by June 24, 2022 and indicated that they will remain within the price range ($34.00 to $35.00 per share) previously
communicated. Mr. Lim also reiterated the buyer consortium’s request that certain members of Meridian’s senior management enter into a commitment to
reinvest into buyer a portion of the proceeds they would receive in connection with an acquisition of Meridian by the buyer consortium. On this point,
Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller again indicated that they were interested in remaining with Meridian in a long term role and that they would be interested in
potentially investing a portion of their merger consideration in Meridian following the closing, but that they could not agree to any proposals or
arrangements in this regard until, at the earliest, following execution of the merger agreement.
On June 16, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian’s senior management and representatives of Rothschild & Co,
Jones Day and KMK were present. Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller provided a summary of their discussion with Messrs. Lim and Lee. After discussing
with representatives of Jones Day, the special committee determined and instructed that Meridian’s management should refrain from negotiating any
post-closing employment arrangements, including any potential future equity participation in the combined entity or any of its affiliates by any of the
members of Meridian’s management until, at the earliest, after the execution of any merger agreement. Jones Day then provided a detailed summary to the
special committee of the revised draft of the merger agreement received from the buyer consortium. Jones Day reviewed with the special committee the
key issues included therein and proposed responses, including in relation to the DOJ Investigation and the proposal regarding the level of efforts that
the buyer consortium would commit to in order to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
During the June 16, 2022 meeting of the special committee, Mr. Kenny also updated the members of the special committee that “Party D,” a global life
science investor, and its portfolio company, “Party E,” had reached out to Mr. Kenny and expressed interest in acquiring Meridian’s life science business.
However, they did not indicate any interest in also acquiring Meridian’s diagnostics business. A discussion ensued whether Party D and Party E should
be added to the market check process. The special committee discussed the value of Meridian as a whole compared to the values of the life science and
diagnostic business units if they were to be sold separately, potential tax inefficiencies resulting from the separate sale of one of Meridian’s business
units, and the fact that the remaining company comprised of only one of the two business units would not be large enough to be viable as a public
company. Based on those considerations, the special committee expressed the view that the sale of Meridian as a whole would likely generate
substantially more value for the Meridian shareholders than separate business unit sales and determined not to include Party D and Party E in the market
check at that stage. The special committee determined to nonetheless keep the communication with Party D and Party E open in the event that they were
to become open to an acquisition of the entire company.

On June 21, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day were present. The representatives of Jones Day reviewed
the status of negotiations of the merger agreement, including, among other issues, whether SDB would be a party to the merger agreement or only
provide a guaranty of the SDB/SJL joint venture that would be formed to acquire Meridian and regarding the treatment of governmental approvals
necessary to complete an acquisition of Meridian. The representatives of Jones Day also discussed with members of the special committee various
alternative approaches that could be taken in response to the buyer consortium’s positions. At the conclusion of these discussions, the special
committee instructed Jones Day to respond to the buyer consortium’s draft of the merger agreement consistent with the special committee’s
determinations.
Later on June 21, 2022, Jones Day provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul Hastings reflecting, among other changes, the revised
proposals for resolution of the key issues approved by the special committee.
On June 24, 2022, following the substantial completion of the buyer consortium’s due diligence, the buyer consortium submitted its written final proposal
(the “final proposal”) to Meridian, under which the buyer consortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price of
$34.00 per share in cash. The buyer consortium expressed in the final proposal that this price incorporated an estimated settlement amount (net of
potential insurance reimbursements) relating to the DOJ Investigation. The buyer consortium also conceded in the final proposal to make SDB a party to
the merger agreement, directly undertaking the obligation to pay, or cause to be paid, the merger consideration. The final proposal indicated that the
buyer consortium intended to retain the current management team of Meridian and offer them a compensation program that is largely similar to Meridian’s
existing compensation program, consisting of a base salary, annual cash-based incentives linked to performance and longer-term equity incentive
opportunities that are in line with U.S. private equity standards. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Piper Sandler contacted representatives of
Rothschild & Co to indicate that the buyer consortium would be providing a revised draft of the merger agreement with the buyer consortium’s proposed
resolutions of the other remaining issues. On June 27, 2022, Jones Day received a revised draft of the merger agreement from Paul Hastings. This draft
included the buyer consortium’s proposal to address risk allocation related to the DOJ Investigation as well as risk allocation on antitrust and foreign
direct investment approvals, including approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Due to the subjectivity of the proposed
language and the broad application of trigger events for a termination right of Columbus Holding, Jones Day was of the view that the approach
introduced significant risk to deal certainty.
On June 28, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting at which members of Meridian senior management, and representatives of Jones Day, Rothschild &
Co and KMK were present. At the meeting, representatives of Jones Day provided the Meridian Board with a presentation of the key outstanding issues
presented in the most recent draft of the merger agreement provided by Paul Hastings. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed its preliminary
financial analysis of Meridian and the $34.00 per share offer price proposed by the buyer consortium. The representatives of Rothschild & Co indicated
that for purposes of its preliminary financial analysis, Meridian’s management had instructed Rothschild & Co to use the Updated Meridian projections
provided to the buyer consortium but revised by Meridian management for the periods through May 31, 2022 for Meridian’s actual performance, which
was modestly lower than the Updated Meridian projections for such periods. Meridian management did not adjust the Updated Meridian projections for
the month of June 2022, but because the Updated Meridian projections were prepared on a quarterly basis, used one-third of the projected amounts for
the quarter ended June 30, 2022 for the month of June 2022. Meridian’s management had instructed Rothschild & Co to continue to use the forecasts
included in the Updated Meridian projections for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and all following fiscal years included in the Updated Meridian
projections. The Meridian Board discussed with representatives of Meridian management Meridian’s expected financial performance for the quarter
ended June 30, 2022, challenges associated with Meridian achieving the Updated Meridian projections, and potential risks associated with the DOJ
investigation. The Meridian Board then discussed potential strategies in responding to the most recent proposal of the buyer consortium on both price
and legal terms, how various Meridian shareholders may view the offer price included in the final proposal and potential reasons that the buyer
consortium had not provided an offer at the top end of their previously indicated range of $34.00 to $35.00. After discussion with representatives of
Rothschild & Co and Jones Day, the Meridian Board instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co to challenge some of the financial assumptions
that had been made by the buyer consortium and, on that basis, ask that the buyer consortium increase its offer price to
41
Table of Contents
$35.00 per share of Meridian common stock, the high end of the previously indicated price range. During the course of the discussions, the Meridian
Board also further discussed the lack of closing certainty associated with the buyer consortium mark-up of the DOJ and antitrust portions of the merger
agreement. It was the consensus of the Meridian Board that the special committee, working with Jones Day, should provide feedback to the buyer
consortium indicating that the proposed treatment in the merger agreement of the DOJ Investigation and the antitrust and foreign direct investment
matters was unacceptable as it failed to provide a sufficient level of closing certainty. The Meridian Board also authorized the special committee, working
with Jones Day, to propose revised contractual provisions relating to the DOJ Investigation and the antitrust and foreign direct investment approvals to
the buyer consortium.
At the June 28, 2022 Meridian Board meeting, Representatives of Rothschild & Co also reported to the Meridian Board that, by June 28, 2022, as part of
the market check previously authorized by the Meridian Board, Rothschild & Co (on behalf of Meridian) had reached out to various potential
counterparties that might be interested in acquiring Meridian, including seven financial sponsors, which, among others, included Party A, Party B and
Party C that had also been included in the 2021 market check, and six strategic operating companies, to inquire whether they would have an interest in
acquiring Meridian. Out of those parties, six financial sponsors, including Party A, Party B and Party C, and one strategic operating company, “Party F,” a
large U.S.-based public company active in the same space as Meridian, executed confidentiality agreements with Meridian, while one financial sponsor
and five strategic operating companies indicated for various reasons that they were not interested in an acquisition of Meridian. As part of the diligence
that such potential counterparties performed, Meridian provided to those parties who executed confidentiality agreements, among other materials, a
management presentation, certain financial information and the Updated Meridian projections. Due, however, to competitive sensitivity Meridian
provided Party F with a summary of the Updated Meridian projections, rather than a fully detailed set of projections. Rothschild & Co received verbal
feedback from Party C indicating that it would not be in a position to offer a price that would be materially higher than the $26.00 proposed in September
2021. Except for Party C and Party F, all potential counterparties ultimately indicated that they would not be interested in acquiring Meridian, with a
majority citing concerns regarding Meridian’s near and medium-term financial performance as the COVID-19 pandemic matures and COVID-19-related
testing continues to decline. Party F had requested additional diligence information that was broad in scope and competitively sensitive and Meridian’s
management team reported that additional time to negotiate the scope of, and respond to Party F’s request would be needed.
On June 29, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co were present. At the meeting,
representatives of Jones Day reviewed with the special committee proposed responses to the material open issues discussed during the meeting of the
Meridian Board the previous day, including with respect to the proposed price, approach to dealing with the DOJ Investigation and the insufficient
proposal from the buyer consortium regarding the antitrust and foreign direct investment aspects of the merger agreement. The special committee
discussed and determined proposed responses that would appropriately address the need for greater deal certainty and various strategic considerations
and instructed the representatives of Jones Day to engage with representatives of Paul Hastings and respond as instructed by the special committee. The
special committee separately instructed representatives of Rothschild & Co to provide a similar response on the key issues to representatives of Piper
Sandler. The responses provided by Jones Day and Rothschild & Co included (i) tying any conditions to closing of the merger in relation to the DOJ
Investigation to an objective standard of measure as to satisfaction and minimizing any such subjective standards of measure that could reduce deal
certainty, (ii) the expectation that the buyer consortium commit to a level of efforts satisfactory to Meridian to obtain the required antitrust and foreign
direct investment approvals and (iii) challenging the buyer consortium’s financial assumptions in proposing a $34.00 per share purchase price, and
requesting that buyer consortium increase its purchase price to the higher end of the previously indicated price range. The special committee further
instructed representatives of Rothschild & Co to request that the buyer consortium increase its offer price and propose its best price for the Meridian
Board to consider.
Later on June 29, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co conveyed to representatives of Piper Sandler the message discussed with the special
committee and shortly thereafter, representatives of Jones Day discussed the same issues with representatives of Paul Hastings.

Table of Contents
Later on June 29, 2022, Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller held a call with Messrs. Lim and Lee, to convey Meridian’s responses on the key open issues
discussed with the special committee. Messrs. Lim and Lee appeared to understand the Meridian Board’s focus on, and need for, deal certainty.
On June 30, 2022, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting the points approved by the special committee.
In the morning of July 1, 2022, Mr. Lee, on behalf of the buyer consortium, responded to Meridian’s challenge to the assumptions of the buyer consortium
in offering $34.00 per share and request that the buyer consortium increase its price to $35.00. Mr. Lee stated that the buyer consortium was unable to
further increase the price per share above $34.00 based on the Updated Meridian projections, its assessment of the underlying assumptions of the
Updated Meridian projections, and its own analysis. The buyer consortium further indicated to Meridian that it had concerns regarding Meridian’s ability
to meet the financial projections that had been provided to the buyer consortium. In the interest of reaching an agreement with Meridian as soon as
possible, however, the buyer consortium nonetheless decided to remain within the previously communicated price range of $34.00 to $35.00, which from a
valuation standpoint the buyer consortium regarded as a “best and final” proposal.
Later in the morning of July 1, 2022, Paul Hastings, in accordance with the instructions provided by the buyer consortium, provided a revised proposal
addressing the provisions of the merger agreement dealing with the DOJ Investigation, the antitrust and foreign direct investment control approvals and
the actions and divestitures that the buyer consortium will be obligated to undertake to obtain the required governmental approvals necessary to
complete an acquisition of Meridian.
On July 1, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian’s senior management, and representatives of Jones Day and
Rothschild & Co were present. The members of the special committee reviewed the revised proposal from the buyer consortium received earlier in the day
from Paul Hastings. The special committee, working with representatives of Jones Day, discussed the risks posed by the construct regarding the closing
condition and termination right associated with the DOJ Investigation proposed by the buyer consortium, including the nature of certain of the proposed
events. Representatives of Rothschild & Co then joined the meeting and the special committee then discussed with representatives of Jones Day and
Rothschild & Co the likely timing for execution of a transaction with the buyer consortium, the current trading price of Meridian’s stock and the response
from the buyer consortium that it would be unwilling to increase its offer price above the existing $34.00 per share proposal. The special committee
continued to be of the view that deal certainty was of paramount importance.
During the July 1, 2022, special committee meeting, the special committee and representatives of Rothschild & Co also discussed the status of the
process with Party F. The special committee instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co to request a revised question list from Party F and offer a
time for a meeting during the week of July 4, 2022. The special committee concluded that it would be preferrable to meet with Party F in advance of
executing a definitive agreement with the buyer consortium, if possible, but that transaction certainty was also of paramount concern. Members of
Meridian’s management expressed concerns about Party F’s bona fide interest in acquiring the company based on the scope of the diligence requests
and the lengthy period of time (almost three weeks) to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Meridian.
Between July 1, 2022 and July 4, 2022, representatives of Jones Day and representatives of Paul Hastings negotiated the outstanding issues to be
reflected in the merger agreement.
On July 3, 2022, Mr. Lee sent a preliminary term sheet to Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller proposing a capital structure for the surviving company and that
each of Messrs. Kenny, Kitzmiller, Serafini-Lamanna, and Dr. Lourdes Weltzien would invest 50% of such executive’s after-tax merger consideration into
preferred stock of the surviving company at the same price as SJL would subscribe for shares of preferred stock in the surviving company, but such price
was not proposed.
On July 4, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co and members of Meridian’s senior
management were present. The representatives of Jones Day reviewed in
43
Table of Contents
detail with the members of the special committee the revised proposals provided by the buyer consortium addressing the treatment of the DOJ
Investigation and other matters, with a focus on the closing condition, and termination rights in favor of SDB. The special committee in coordination with
Jones Day determined a counterproposal to the outstanding issues and instructed Jones Day to provide Paul Hastings with a revised draft of the merger
agreement reflecting such counterproposal.
Later on July 4, 2022, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings a revised proposal regarding the treatment of the DOJ Investigation. In the evening of July 4,
2022, Jones Day received a further revised draft of the merger agreement from Paul Hastings. Such revised draft accepted Meridian’s changes to the
provisions of the merger agreement dealing with the DOJ Investigation.
On July 5, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co were present. At the meeting, the
special committee discussed that the buyer consortium had provided the term sheet on July 3, 2022 and again expressed a desire to discuss proposed
employment and reinvestment terms with Meridian’s management. After discussing with representatives of Jones Day and consistent with the Meridian
Board’s and the special committee’s prior directives, the special committee reiterated that Meridian’s management should not negotiate employment or
post-closing reinvestment terms at least until after execution of a definitive merger agreement. The special committee and representatives of Jones Day
also reviewed the proposed communications plan associated with the transaction and the most recent proposal from the buyer consortium regarding the
antitrust provisions of the merger agreement. Consistent with the authorization of the Meridian Board at its June 28, 2022 meeting, the special committee
then authorized Jones Day to respond to the proposal regarding the merger agreement.
Later on July 5, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings a revised draft of the merger agreement, reflecting a few outstanding issues.
On July 6, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting (the “July 6 meeting”) at which members of Meridian’s senior management and representatives of
Jones Day and Rothschild & Co were present. At the July 6 meeting, representatives of Jones Day again reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties under
Ohio law against the background of the final and best offer from the buyer consortium, the level of transaction certainty under the revised draft of the
merger agreement, the results of the market check performed by Meridian with the assistance of Rothschild & Co and other relevant factors. The Meridian
Board then reviewed the status of discussions with Party F. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reported that Party F had not responded to Rothschild &
Co’s request to schedule a meeting with a revised agenda. Meridian’s senior management indicated that given the lack of a response from Party F to
Rothschild & Co’s request to schedule a meeting and the time it took Party F to enter into a confidentiality agreement, they continued to have concerns
about Party F’s bona fide interest in acquiring the company. After further discussions among the Meridian Board, including with members of Meridian’s
senior management, and representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co, the Meridian Board unanimously determined to not further pursue a
potential transaction with Party F at this time, as it did not appear likely to the Meridian Board that Party F would provide a competitive offer to acquire
the company on a timely basis, or at all.
In the July 6 meeting, representatives of Jones Day also provided to the members of the Meridian Board an overview of the key terms and conditions of,
and the remaining open issues raised in, the revised draft of the merger agreement, and the most recent discussions regarding those issues between
representatives of Jones Day and representatives of Paul Hastings, emphasizing the proposed resolutions reached between such representatives
regarding the required antitrust and foreign direct investment approvals and the DOJ Investigation. The members of the Meridian Board concluded that
the proposed provisions addressing the DOJ Investigation and the antitrust and foreign direct investment approvals constituted an acceptable
compromise regarding these issues. The Meridian Board discussed with Meridian’s management and representatives of Jones Day the last remaining
merger agreement issues and instructed the representatives of Jones Day on how they should resolve those issues with the buyer consortium and
proceed to finalize the merger agreement.

Table of Contents
In the July 6 meeting, representatives of Rothschild & Co also reviewed Rothschild & Co’s financial analysis of the Company and the proposed
transaction with the buyer consortium. Rothschild & Co then rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated July 6, 2022, to the Meridian Board to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and
assumptions stated in such opinion, the $34.00 in cash per share of Meridian common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of Meridian common
stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
At the conclusion of the July 6 meeting, the Meridian Board unanimously (1) deemed it advisable and in the best interests of Meridian and the Meridian
shareholders to enter into the merger agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger; (2)
determined that the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement by Meridian are fair to and in the best interests of Meridian and the
Meridian shareholders; and (3) recommended that the Meridian shareholders adopt the merger agreement.
Early in the morning on July 7, 2022, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement, following which time the parties issued a press release
announcing the transaction.

In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Meridian Board consulted with Meridian’s management and its outside financial and legal
advisors and, in reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger, the Meridian Board considered a variety of factors,
including the following:
•
Meridian’s business, current and projected financial condition, earnings and prospects;
•
the Meridian Board’s belief that the $34.00 per share merger consideration exceeds Meridian’s likely value that could otherwise be achieved,
including taking into account Meridian’s potential for, and risks to, future growth as well as the potential value that could be realized from
alternatives reasonably available to Meridian, including, but not limited to, special dividends or distributions, leveraged stock repurchases,
an acquisition or a series of acquisitions, an asset sale or divestiture of a business segment of Meridian and the continued operation of
Meridian on a stand-alone basis;
•
the anticipated future trading prices of Meridian common stock on a standalone basis, based on management estimates and adjusted for
different scenarios, and the uncertainties of continuing on a standalone basis as a public company;
•
the fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash, providing Meridian shareholders with certainty of value and liquidity upon
consummation of the merger;
•
recent and historical market prices for Meridian common stock, including the market performance of the Meridian common stock relative to
those of other participants in Meridian’s sector and general market indices, and as compared to the merger consideration, including the fact
that the merger consideration of $34.00 per share represents an approximate premium of:
•
32% to Meridian’s per share closing price of $25.67 on March 17, 2022 (which is the day immediately preceding the date on which the
buyer consortium submitted the indicative proposal); and
•
16% to the $29.31 per share of Meridian common stock based on the one-month average price per share of Meridian common stock
commencing on June 7, 2022, the date on which, at Meridian’s direction, Rothschild & Co began contacting certain potential other
acquirors of Meridian to determine whether another party may be willing to pay more than the buyer consortium;
•
the opinion of Rothschild & Co, financial advisor to Meridian, that, as of July 6, 2022, and based upon and subject to the qualifications,
limitations and assumptions stated in such opinion, the $34.00 in cash per share of Meridian common stock to be paid to the holders (other

a financial point of view to such holders, and the financial analyses related thereto prepared by Rothschild & Co and described below under
“The Merger (Proposal 1)—Opinion of Meridian’s Financial Advisor”;
•
the course and history of the negotiations between Meridian and Columbus Holding, as described under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Background of the Merger,” including the Meridian Board’s and management’s belief that Columbus Holding’s offer of $34.00 per share was
Columbus Holding’s best and final offer;
•
the fact that Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub agreed to (and agreed to cause their controlled affiliates and SJL to) use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary governmental approvals with respect to the merger, including divesting assets as necessary
to obtain any such approval, subject to certain limitations;
•
the Meridian Board’s belief, after consultation with Meridian’s financial advisor, the 2021 and 2022 market checks conducted in the past two
years, and its knowledge of the industry and the operations of Meridian, that it was unlikely that any other financial sponsor or strategic
buyer (i) would be willing to acquire Meridian at a price in excess of $34.00 per share in cash, and (ii) would ultimately consummate the
transaction on terms similar to or more favorable to Meridian than those set forth in the merger agreement, even if Meridian were to conduct
other solicitations of alternative acquisition proposals, including:
•
that positive macroeconomic and industry factors had increased demand for Meridian’s products and services during and as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk that such demand could subside as the pandemic moves to an endemic phase, and internal
factors, such as Meridian management’s valuation and projections, each suggested that this would be an opportune time to explore a
sale process and obtain maximum value for Meridian shareholders;
•
that Meridian had conducted a lengthy and thorough process, both in 2021 and in 2022 since the buyer consortium submitted its
initial offer to acquire Meridian, involving outreach to 13 potential acquirers, of which seven entered into non-disclosure agreements
with Meridian and received due diligence, and no other potential acquiror provided an indication of interest or definitive proposal to
acquire Meridian for $34.00 per share or more; and
•
that the financial projections set forth in the Updated Meridian projections were subject to certain market and sector risks not viewed
by Meridian’s management as within the control of Meridian that, based upon the Meridian Board’s knowledge of Meridian’s
business and that potential counterparties and market analysts had expressed views with respect to broader sector conditions and
competitive dynamics that might adversely affect Meridian’s ability to realize the Updated Meridian projections;
•
the Meridian Board’s belief that the provisions of the merger agreement providing for the payment of a termination fee by Meridian, and
other limitations applicable to, among other things, the ability of the Meridian Board to make a change of recommendation and review and
consider unsolicited alternative acquisition proposals were reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially
capable potential acquirer from submitting a proposal to acquire Meridian following the announcement of the merger;
•
the fact that Meridian’s outside financial and legal advisors were involved in the negotiations and updated the chairman of the Meridian
Board, the special committee and the Meridian Board directly and regularly throughout the process, which provided oversight and
additional perspectives on the negotiations in addition to those of Meridian’s management;
•
the fact that, under applicable Ohio law, the Meridian shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and
otherwise comply with the requirements of Ohio law would have the right to pursue their dissenters’ rights under Ohio law if the merger is
completed; and

Table of Contents
•
the Meridian Board’s review of the structure of the merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement, including, among
others, the following terms of the merger agreement:
•
the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the Meridian Board believed are reasonable and customary in
number and scope and are reasonably likely to be satisfied;
•
representations from SDB and Columbus Holding that they will have available all funds necessary for the payment of the aggregate
merger consideration, and the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement;
•
a review of SDB’s balance sheet and consideration of its cash on hand and likely borrowing ability;
•
the ability of the Meridian Board, subject to certain conditions, to provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations
with a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal if the Meridian Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a superior proposal, and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties;
•
the ability of the Meridian Board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation that Meridian shareholders approve
and adopt the merger agreement and, in addition, to cause Meridian to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement that constitutes a superior proposal, if the Meridian Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
•
the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Meridian in the merger agreement;
•
the fact that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement minimize, to the extent reasonably practical, the risk that a condition to
closing would not be satisfied and also provide reasonable flexibility to operate Meridian’s business during the pendency of the
merger, including with respect to actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•
Meridian’s ability, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement, to specifically enforce SDB’s and Columbus Holding’s
obligation to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
In the course of its deliberations, the Meridian Board, in consultation with Meridian’s management and Meridian’s outside financial and legal advisors,
also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the merger agreement and the merger, including the following:
•
the fact that, subsequent to completion of the merger, Meridian will no longer exist as a public company and that the nature of the
transaction as a cash transaction would prevent Meridian shareholders from being able to participate in any value creation that Meridian
could generate going forward, as well as any future appreciation in value of Meridian;
•
the covenants in the merger agreement prohibiting Meridian from soliciting other potential acquisition proposals, and restricting its ability
to entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain conditions are satisfied;
•
the fact that Meridian would be obligated to pay a termination fee of $45,960,000 under certain circumstances, including the potential impact
of such termination fee on the willingness of other potential acquirers to propose alternative transactions, although the Meridian Board
believed that the termination fee was reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquirer
from submitting a proposal to acquire Meridian following the announcement of the merger;
47
Table of Contents
•
the fact that Columbus Holding’s, SDB’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the merger are subject to conditions, and the
possibility that such conditions may not be satisfied, including as a result of events outside of Meridian’s control, and the fact that, if the
merger is not consummated:
•
Meridian’s directors, officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant
distractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction, and Meridian will have incurred significant transaction costs
attempting to consummate the transaction;
•
the market’s perception of Meridian’s continuing business could potentially result in a loss of customers, suppliers, distributors,
business partners, collaboration partners and employees; and
•
the trading price of Meridian common stock could be adversely affected;
•
the potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on Meridian’s business and relationships with customers, suppliers,
distributors, business partners, collaboration partners and employees, including the risk that certain key members of Meridian management
might choose not to remain employed with Meridian prior to the completion of the merger, regardless of whether or not the merger is
completed;
•
the fact that Meridian is obligated to provide Columbus Holding with notice of any acquisition proposal and the opportunity within four
business days of such notice, subject to extension under certain circumstances, to match any competing acquisition proposal that
constitutes a superior proposal, although the Meridian Board believed this would not preclude a potential acquirer from submitting a
proposal to acquire Meridian;
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Meridian has agreed to restrictions on the conduct of its business before completion
of the merger, generally requiring Meridian to use commercially reasonable efforts to carry on its business in all material respects in the
ordinary course and, subject to specified exceptions, that Meridian will not take a number of actions related to the conduct of its business
without Columbus Holding’s prior written consent, and the possibility these terms may limit the ability of Meridian to pursue business
opportunities that it would otherwise pursue, which actions could create additional shareholder value;
•
the fact that certain of Meridian’s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from, and in addition to,
those of Meridian’s other shareholders. See “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Meridian’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger”;
•
the fact that Meridian has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the proposed
transaction, regardless of whether the merger is consummated;
•
the fact that the exchange of Meridian common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; and
•
the fact that the merger consideration represented a premium of 8.5% over the closing price of the Meridian shares on July 5, 2022, the day
prior to the date on which the Meridian Board approved the merger agreement and the merger, which premium was lower than the premium
to the price of the Meridian share at the time the buyer consortium provided the indicative proposal and lower than the premiums in certain
other selected transactions.
After considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Meridian Board concluded that the potentially positive factors
substantially outweighed the potentially negative factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Meridian Board is not exhaustive but is intended to reflect the material factors
considered by the Meridian Board in its consideration of the merger. In view of the complexity and the large number of the factors considered, the
Meridian Board, both individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various factors. Rather, the Meridian
Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members of the Meridian
Board may have given different weights to different factors. The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The foregoing discussion of the
information and factors

As of December 2, 2019, Meridian retained Rothschild & Co as its financial advisor in connection with its evaluation of the potential sale, merger or other
business/strategic combination involving Meridian, including, without limitation, with respect to the merger contemplated by the merger agreement.
Meridian selected Rothschild & Co based on its qualifications, expertise and familiarity with Meridian’s business and industry. As part of its investment
banking business, Rothschild & Co regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
restructurings and other transactions.
On July 6, 2022, at a meeting of the Meridian Board held to evaluate the proposed transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, Rothschild & Co
delivered to the Meridian Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery to the Meridian Board of a written opinion dated July 6,
2022, to the effect that, as of such date and on the basis of and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth in the written opinion,
the merger consideration payable to the holders of Meridian common stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) in the merger pursuant to
the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Rothschild & Co’s written opinion, dated July 6, 2022, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is
incorporated herein by reference. Meridian shareholders are urged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. The summary of Rothschild &
Co’s opinion contained in Annex B is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion.
Rothschild & Co’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Meridian Board in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the merger.
Rothschild & Co’s opinion should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on Rothschild & Co’s part to any party. Rothschild & Co’s opinion
was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Meridian common stock of the merger consideration payable to such
holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement. Rothschild & Co was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion as to the terms, other than the
merger consideration to the extent expressly set forth in its opinion, of the merger, the merger agreement or any other agreement entered into in
connection with the merger. Rothschild & Co expressed no opinion as to the price at which Meridian common stock would trade at any future time. In
addition, Rothschild & Co did not express any opinion as to Meridian’s underlying business decision to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the
merger as compared to any alternative transaction. Rothschild & Co’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Meridian Board as to whether
to approve the merger or a recommendation as to how any holder of Meridian common stock should vote or otherwise act with respect to the merger or
any other matter. In addition, Rothschild & Co was not asked by the Meridian Board to address, nor did Rothschild & Co’s opinion address, (i) the
fairness to, or any other consideration of, the holders of any class of securities, other than holders of Meridian common stock and then only to the extent
expressly set forth in Rothschild & Co’s opinion, or creditors or other constituencies of Meridian or (ii) the
49Table of Contents
fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of SDB, SJL, Columbus Holding,
Meridian, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise.
In connection with its opinion, Rothschild & Co, among other things:
•
reviewed the draft of the merger agreement dated July 6, 2022 provided to the Meridian Board in connection with its meeting on July 6, 2022;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information that Rothschild & Co deemed to be generally relevant concerning
Meridian and the industry in which it operates, including certain publicly available research analyst reports and the reported price and
historical trading activity for the shares of Meridian common stock;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies
Rothschild & Co deemed generally relevant and the consideration received in such transactions;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of Meridian with publicly available information concerning certain other public
companies Rothschild & Co deemed generally relevant, including data relating to public market trading levels and implied trading multiples;
•
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Meridian, including
the Updated Meridian projections prepared by the management of Meridian. Please refer to the section under the heading “The Merger
(Proposal 1)—Certain Financial Projections” for more details; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as Rothschild & Co deemed appropriate for the
purposes of its opinion.
In addition, Rothschild & Co held discussions with certain members of the management of Meridian regarding the merger, the past and current business
operations and financial condition and prospects of Meridian, the Updated Meridian projections and certain other matters Rothschild & Co believed
necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In arriving at its opinion, with Meridian’s consent, Rothschild & Co relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished or made available to Rothschild & Co by or on behalf of Meridian and its
associates, affiliates and advisors, or otherwise reviewed by or for it, and Rothschild & Co did not assume any responsibility or liability therefor.
Rothschild & Co did not conduct any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities of Meridian, nor were any such valuations or appraisals provided
to Rothschild & Co, and Rothschild & Co did not express any opinion as to the value of such assets or liabilities. Rothschild & Co did not evaluate the
solvency or fair value of Meridian, SDB or Columbus Holding under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
In addition, Rothschild & Co did not assume any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or the facilities of Meridian, SDB or
Columbus Holding. At the direction of the management of Meridian, Rothschild & Co used and relied upon the Updated Meridian projections for
purposes of its opinion. In relying on the Updated Meridian projections, Rothschild & Co assumed, at the direction of Meridian, that they were
reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by Meridian’s management as to the expected
future results of operations and financial condition of Meridian. Rothschild & Co did not express any view as to the reasonableness of the Updated
Meridian projections and the assumptions on which they are based.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Rothschild & Co assumed that the merger would be consummated as contemplated in the merger agreement
without any waiver or amendment of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the parties would comply with all material terms of the
merger agreement and that in connection with the receipt of all necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the
merger, no material delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed. For purposes of
50
Table of Contents
rendering its opinion, Rothschild & Co assumed that there had not occurred any material change in the assets, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of Meridian since the date of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, relating to
Meridian made available to Rothschild & Co, and that there was no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by
Rothschild & Co incomplete or misleading. Rothschild & Co did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that may result from the
merger, nor did its opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters. Rothschild & Co relied as to all legal, tax and regulatory matters
relevant to rendering its opinion upon the assessments made by Meridian and its other advisors with respect to such issues. In arriving at its opinion,
Rothschild & Co did not take into account any litigation, regulatory or other proceeding that was pending or may be brought against Meridian or any of
its affiliates. In addition, Rothschild & Co relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the final form of the merger agreement would
not differ in any material respect from the draft copy of the merger agreement reviewed by it. Rothschild & Co’s opinion was necessarily based on
securities markets, economic, monetary, financial and other general business and financial conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and the
information made available to Rothschild & Co as of, the date of the opinion and the conditions and prospects, financial and otherwise, of Meridian as
they were reflected in the information provided to Rothschild & Co and as they were represented to Rothschild & Co in discussions with the management
of Meridian. Although subsequent developments may affect Rothschild & Co’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, Rothschild & Co does
not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion.
The following represents a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Rothschild & Co, each of which is a standard valuation methodology
customarily undertaken in transactions of this type, in connection with providing its opinion, dated July 6, 2022, to the Meridian Board. The summary of
these analyses is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors considered by Rothschild & Co. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex analytical process that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application
of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. No one method of
analysis should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Rothschild & Co. Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and
weaknesses, and the nature of the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques. The conclusion reached by Rothschild & Co
was based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole and also on application of Rothschild & Co’s experience and judgment, which conclusion may
involve significant elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Some of the summaries of financial analyses performed by Rothschild & Co
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Rothschild & Co, the tables must be read
together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth
in the tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Rothschild & Co. The order of analyses described below
does not represent the relative importance or weight given to the analysis by Rothschild & Co.
As used in this section, (a) all references to “fully diluted” shares and phrases of similar import, when used in relation to Meridian, mean the number of
fully diluted outstanding shares of Meridian common stock (including all performance-based restricted stock units, time-based restricted stock units, and
stock options, calculated on a treasury stock method basis) based on the most recently available information as of July 6, 2022 as provided by the
management of Meridian to Rothschild & Co, which number of fully diluted shares was equal to 45,058,656, (b) the “EV” of a company as of any given
time refers to the enterprise value of such company (calculated as further discussed below) at such time, and (c) the “EBITDA” of a company for any
given period means the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of such company during such period and includes the expense of
stock-based compensation.
Selected Public Company Analysis
Rothschild & Co performed a selected public companies analysis in order to derive an implied per share equity value reference range for the Meridian
common stock from the market value and trading multiples of other
51
Table of Contents
publicly traded companies and then compared this implied per share equity value reference range with the merger consideration provided for in the
merger agreement. While none of the following companies are identical to Meridian, Rothschild & Co selected these companies because they operate in
the life sciences or diagnostics industries, have publicly traded equity securities and were deemed by Rothschild & Co, based on its professional
judgment and experience, for purposes of this analysis, to be similar to Meridian in one or more respects, including size, lines of business, business
models, areas of diagnostic testing (including for detecting SARS-CoV-2) and end-market exposure. The publicly traded companies selected by
Rothschild & Co for purposes of this analysis included the companies listed in the chart below, which Rothschild & Co refers to, collectively, as the
“selected public companies.”
For purposes of its analysis of the selected public companies, Rothschild & Co (i) reviewed, among other things, for each of the selected public
companies, the per share stock price of such selected public companies as of July 5, 2022, public filings made by such selected public companies for
certain historical financial information and data for such selected public companies that Rothschild & Co obtained from broker research, (ii) calculated the
EV of each of the selected public companies as a multiple of the estimated revenue for calendarized fiscal years ending September 30, 2022 and September
30, 2023, which multiple Rothschild & Co refers to as “EV/Revenue,” and (iii) calculated the EV of each of the selected public companies as a multiple of
the estimated EBITDA for calendarized fiscal years ending September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which multiple Rothschild & Co refers to as
“EV/EBITDA.”
EV was calculated as fully diluted equity market value based on per share stock prices plus, with respect to each of the selected public companies, such
company’s most recently disclosed net debt and other adjustments or with respect to Meridian, EV was calculated as Meridian’s fully diluted market
valued based on its per Meridian common share prices plus Meridian’s debt, government grants, and other debt-like items, less Meridian’s consolidated
cash and cash equivalents, each as of May 31, 2022 and as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Meridian. With
respect to two of the selected publicly traded companies, R&D had been capitalized under International Financial Reporting Standards and Rothschild &
Co adjusted their respective EVs as if R&D had been fully expensed. With respect to five of the eight peers, underfunded pensions were treated as debt-
like items and added back to their respective EVs. With respect to Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., its 30% stake in Sartorius AG was treated as a cash
equivalent for the purposes of calculating its respective EV.
The results of Rothschild & Co’s review of the EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA are summarized in the charts below:

Based on the 2022E EV/Revenue and 2023E EV/Revenue multiples calculated above and on Rothschild & Co’s professional judgment, Rothschild & Co
applied an illustrative range of EV/ Revenue of 2.25x to 3.75x and 2.75x to 3.75x to the estimated consolidated revenue of Meridian for its fiscal years 2022
and 2023, respectively, each as provided in the Updated Meridian projections, to reach a range of implied EVs for Meridian for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.
Based on the 2022 estimated EV/EBITDA and 2023 estimated EV/EBITDA multiples calculated above and on Rothschild & Co’s professional judgment,
Rothschild & Co applied an illustrative range of EV/EBITDA of 11.0x to 13.5x and 11.5x to 14.0x to the estimated EBITDA of Meridian for its fiscal years
2022 and 2023, respectively, each as provided in the Updated Meridian projections, to reach a range of implied EVs for Meridian for fiscal years 2022 and
2023. To calculate implied equity values, Rothschild & Co then subtracted from such implied EVs the amount of Meridian’s debt, government grants, and
other debt-like items, and added to such implied EVs the amount of Meridian’s consolidated cash and cash equivalents, each as of May 31, 2022 and as
provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Meridian. Rothschild & Co then divided such implied equity values by the
number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Meridian common stock, as provided by the management of Meridian and approved for Rothschild & Co’s
use, to reach the following implied per share equity value reference ranges for Meridian, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as compared to the merger
consideration:

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Rothschild & Co performed a selected precedent transactions analysis in order to derive an implied per share equity value reference range for Meridian
from implied transaction enterprise value multiples in merger or acquisition transactions involving other companies that occurred since 2010 and then
compared this implied per share equity value reference range with the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement. Using publicly available
information, Rothschild & Co analyzed the enterprise value multiples in the 20 selected transactions listed in the table below involving target companies
with business operations in the life sciences industry and the diagnostics industry that in Rothschild & Co’s view based on its professional judgement
and experience generally reflected similar characteristics to Meridian’s business operations. In the table below, Rothschild & Co refers to “last twelve
months” as “LTM” and “next twelve months” as “NTM.”

Based on its professional judgment and experience, Rothschild & Co deemed these transactions relevant to consider in relation to Meridian and the
merger. No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Meridian or the merger. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this
54
Table of Contents
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which
Meridian or the merger was compared.
For purposes of this analysis, Rothschild & Co calculated the enterprise value of each of the target companies in the selected precedent transactions
based on the market and financial data of the target companies as well as the following metrics:
•
the implied EV of the target company of the selected transaction as a multiple of the LTM Revenue, LTM EBITDA, NTM Revenue, and
NTM EBITDA of the target company that was publicly disclosed at the time each such selected transaction was announced or, where
available, as a multiple of the LTM Revenue and LTM EBITDA of the target company during the 12-month period ending closest to the date
of announcement of the merger or acquisition for which such information was publicly available, which multiples Rothschild & Co refers to
as EV/LTM Revenue and EV/LTM EBITDA, as a multiple of the NTM Revenue and NTM EBITDA of the target company during the 12-
month period following closest to the date of announcement of the merger or acquisition for which such information was publicly available,
which multiples Rothschild & Co refers to as EV/NTM Revenue and EV/NTM EBITDA; and
•
underfunded pensions were treated as debt-like items and added back to EV for precedent transactions involving a target that was public at
the time of the merger or acquisition.

Table of Contents
Based on the EV/LTM Revenue multiple calculated for the selected transactions and on Rothschild & Co’s professional judgment, Rothschild & Co
applied an illustrative range of EV/LTM Revenue of 3.5x to 4.5x to the estimated LTM Revenue of Meridian for the period ended September 30, 2022, as
provided in the Updated Meridian projections, to reach a range of implied EVs for Meridian. Based on the EV/LTM EBITDA multiple calculated for the
selected transactions and on Rothschild & Co’s professional judgment, Rothschild & Co applied an illustrative range of EV/LTM EBITDA of 13.5x to
15.5x to the estimated LTM EBITDA of Meridian for the period ended September 30, 2022, as provided in the Updated Meridian projections, to reach a
range of implied EVs for Meridian. Based on the EV/NTM Revenue multiple calculated for the selected transactions and on Rothschild & Co’s
professional judgment, Rothschild & Co applied an illustrative range of EV/NTM Revenue of 3.5x to 4.5x to the estimated NTM Revenue of Meridian for
the period ended September 30, 2023, as provided in the Updated Meridian projections, to reach a range of implied EVs for Meridian. Based on the
EV/NTM EBITDA multiple calculated for the selected transactions and on Rothschild & Co’s professional judgment, Rothschild & Co applied an
illustrative range of EV/NTM EBITDA of 12.0x to 14.5x to the estimated NTM EBITDA of Meridian for the period ended September 30, 2023, as provided
in the Updated Meridian projections, to reach a range of implied EVs for Meridian. To calculate implied equity values, Rothschild & Co then subtracted
from such implied EVs Meridian’s debt, government grants, and other debt-like items and added to such implied EVs, Meridian’s consolidated cash and
cash equivalents, each as of May 31, 2022 and as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Meridian. Rothschild & Co
then divided such implied equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Meridian common stock, as provided by the management of
Meridian and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use, to reach the following implied per share equity value reference ranges for Meridian, rounded to the
nearest $0.05, as compared to the merger consideration:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Rothschild & Co performed a discounted cash flow analysis for Meridian in order to derive an implied per share equity value reference range for the entire
company if it were to remain an independent public company, and then compared this implied per share equity value reference range with the merger
consideration provided for in the merger agreement. In this analysis, Rothschild & Co calculated a range of implied EVs for Meridian by adding (i) the
estimated unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Meridian was forecasted to generate from the four months ended September 30, 2022 through the end
of fiscal year 2027 based on the Updated Meridian projections provided by the management of Meridian, discounted to present value, as of May 31, 2022,
after the application of a range of illustrative discount rates, which were based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which Rothschild &Co
refers to as “WACC,” for Meridian to (ii) the present value, as of May 31, 2022 of the implied terminal value of Meridian, after the application of a range of
illustrative discount rates based on the estimated WACC for Meridian. Rothschild & Co estimated the terminal value of Meridian by applying an
illustrative range of growth rates in perpetuity of 2.25% to 3.25%, which Rothschild & Co selected using its experience and professional judgment, to the
estimated unlevered after-tax free cash flows included in the Updated Meridian projections for the terminal period, which resulted in a range of estimated
terminal values, after the application of a range of illustrative discount rates, the midpoint of which was $1.087 billion.
56
Table of Contents
Unlevered, after-tax free cash flows for the terminal period were calculated as net operating profit after taxes, which we refer to as “NOPAT,” after
application of the illustrative range of growth rates described above, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, less change in net
working capital. Rothschild & Co used the mid-year discounting convention and applied a range of illustrative discount rates of 9.5% to 11.0%, based on
an estimated WACC of 10.25%, which Rothschild & Co calculated using the traditional CAPM (capital asset pricing model).
Rothschild & Co calculated a range of implied equity values for Meridian by subtracting from the range of combined implied EVs the amount of
Meridian’s debt and government grants as of May 31, 2022, and by adding to the range of combined implied EVs the amount of Meridian’s consolidated
cash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2022, each as provided and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use by the management of Meridian. Rothschild &
Co then divided the ranges of implied equity values for Meridian by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Meridian common stock, as
provided by the management of Meridian and approved for Rothschild & Co’s use. These analyses indicated the following implied per share equity value
reference ranges for Meridian, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as compared to the merger consideration:

Other Factors
In rendering its opinion, for illustrative purposes only and not relied upon in reaching its conclusion, Rothschild & Co also reviewed and considered
other factors, including:
•
historic intraday prices, closing prices, and volume weighted average prices, which we refer to as “VWAPS,” of Meridian common stock,
noting, as reference points that (i) the intraday price of Meridian common stock, ranged from $17.04 to $31.93 in the 52-week period
preceding July 5, 2022, two trading days prior to public announcement of the transaction, with the merger consideration representing a
premium range of 6.5% to 99.5%, (ii) the closing price of Meridian common stock on March 17, 2022, the day prior to the first offer from SDB
and SJL, was $25.67, with the merger consideration representing a 32.5% premium, and the closing price of Meridian common stock on June
6, 2022, the day the Meridian Board authorized outreach by Rothschild & Co to potential acquirers, was $27.92, with the merger
consideration representing a 21.8% premium, and (iii) the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement as compared to various
VWAPs of Meridian common stock represents a 14.4% premium to the 1-month VWAP of $29.72, a 19.7% premium to the 2-month VWAP of
$28.41, a 21.6% premium to the 3-month VWAP of $27.95, and a 33.0% premium to the 6-month VWAP of $25.57, as of July 5, 2022; and
•
the premiums paid in selected precedent cash consideration transactions, involving U.S. listed targets announced since 2018 with implied
enterprise values greater than $500 million, noting that the first (1st) and third (3rd) quartile of premiums paid in these selected transactions
relative to the target company’s (i) closing stock price one day prior to announcement of the transaction ranged from 14.3% to 52.2% and
when applied to the closing price of $31.35 per share of Meridian common stock on July 5, 2022, the resulting range of implied prices was
$35.85 to $47.75 per share of Meridian common stock, (ii) average closing stock price for 20 trading days before transaction announcement
ranged from 18.2% to 53.3% and when applied to the average closing price for 20 trading days prior to July 5, 2022 of $29.03 per share of
Meridian common stock, the resulting range of implied prices was $34.30 to $44.50 per share of Meridian common stock, and (iii) 52-week
high stock price prior to announcement of the transaction ranged from (7.8%) to 20.3% and when applied to the 52-week high price of $31.93
per share of Meridian common stock on June 27, 2022, the resulting range of implied prices was $29.45 to $38.40 per share of Meridian
common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05.

The valuation and financial analyses set out above are not a comprehensive description of all analyses and examinations actually conducted by
Rothschild & Co in connection with its opinion and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion of Rothschild & Co
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
Miscellaneous
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
valuation and financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances involved, and therefore a fairness opinion
necessarily is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Rothschild & Co believes that its analyses and the summary set forth above
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all of the described analyses
and factors, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying Rothschild & Co’s analyses and opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Rothschild & Co considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered. Rather,
Rothschild & Co made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its
analyses. No company or transaction used in the analyses described above as a comparison is directly comparable to Meridian or the merger.
In performing its analyses, Rothschild & Co made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Meridian. Rothschild & Co’s analyses were based in part on the Updated
Meridian projections and other third-party research analyst estimates, which are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, and
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Rothschild & Co’s analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of
the analysis performed by Rothschild & Co with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Meridian common stock (other
than excluded shares and dissenting shares) of the merger consideration payable to such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, and
were provided to the Meridian Board in connection with the delivery of Rothschild & Co’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade at any time in the future.
As described above, Rothschild & Co’s opinion, together with the financial analyses performed by Rothschild & Co in connection with its opinion and
reviewed by the Meridian Board, were among the many factors that the Meridian Board took into consideration in making the recommendation of the
Meridian Board described in “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for the Merger.” Rothschild & Co was not requested to, and did not, recommend any
specific amount of consideration to the Meridian Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the
merger. The amount and type of consideration payable in the merger was determined through arms-length negotiations between Meridian, on the one
hand, and SDB and SJL, on the other hand. Consequently, Rothschild & Co’s opinion should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Meridian
Board or the management of Meridian with respect to the merger consideration or the merger, including whether the Meridian Board would have been
willing to determine that a different merger consideration was fair.
Rothschild & Co is acting as financial advisor to Meridian with respect to the merger contemplated by the merger agreement and will receive an aggregate
fee of approximately $22,200,000 from Meridian for its services, $1,500,000 of which became payable upon delivery of Rothschild & Co’s opinion and the
balance of which (currently, approximately $20,700,000) is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Meridian has also agreed to reimburse
Rothschild & Co for certain expenses and to indemnify Rothschild & Co against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two-year period ending on July 6, 2022, Rothschild & Co did not provide financial services to SDB, SJL, Columbus Holding or Meridian other
than, in the case of Meridian, with respect to Rothschild & Co’s
58
Table of Contents
financial advisory services in connection with its evaluation of the potential sale, merger or other business/strategic combination involving Meridian,
including, without limitation, with respect to the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. Rothschild & Co and its affiliates are engaged in a wide
range of financial advisory and investment banking activities. Rothschild & Co or its affiliates may in the future provide financial services to Meridian,
Columbus Holding, SDB, SJL and/or any of their respective affiliates in the ordinary course of Rothschild & Co’s businesses from time to time and may
receive fees for the rendering of such services. In addition, in the ordinary course of their asset management, merchant banking and other business
activities, affiliates of Rothschild & Co may trade in the securities of Meridian, Columbus Holding, SDB, SJL and any of their respective affiliates, for their
own accounts or for the accounts of their affiliates and customers, and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.
Rothschild & Co’s opinion was given and speaks only as of its date. Rothschild & Co’s opinion was approved by the Global Advisory Commitment
Committee of Rothschild & Co.

MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
Except for annual guidance, Meridian does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance, and has refrained from making
projections for extended periods, due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and
the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Meridian is including in this proxy statement the Meridian projections (as defined
below), which are a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information of Meridian on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the
merger, in order to provide Meridian shareholders access to information that was made available to the Meridian Board in connection with its evaluation
of the merger and the merger consideration. Preliminary Meridian projections were prepared by Meridian’s management and made available to the buyer
consortium on March 5, 2022. Updated Meridian projections were subsequently prepared by Meridian’s management and made available to the buyer
consortium on April 5, 2022, in connection with the buyer consortium’s due diligence review. We refer to the Preliminary Meridian projections provided
on March 5, 2022 and the Updated Meridian projections provided on April 5, 2022 collectively as “the Meridian projections.”
The Updated Meridian projections were made available to potential counterparties who executed a confidentiality agreement with Meridian in connection
with the market check performed by Meridian in June 2022 (see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Background of the Merger” for details
regarding the market check). The Updated Meridian projections were also made available to Rothschild & Co in connection with its review and advice to
the Meridian Board and special committee regarding the financial terms of the merger and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. At the
instruction of Meridian’s management, Rothschild & Co also used the Updated Meridian projections, as further updated for Meridian’s actual
performance between April 5, 2022 and June 30, 2022 as further described in the tables below, in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the
Meridian Board (see the section entitled “—Opinion of Meridian’s Financial Advisor” for details regarding Rothschild & Co’s opinion).
The Meridian projections shall be deemed to include for purposes of the disclaimers contained in this section, unless the context requires otherwise,
other prospective financial information included below. Meridian advised the recipients of the Meridian projections that its internal financial forecasts are
subjective in many respects. The inclusion of the Meridian projections should not be regarded as an indication that the Meridian Board, Rothschild &
Co, Meridian or its management or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future
results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.
The Meridian projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Meridian projections were based are subjective in many respects and are
subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of Meridian’s industry and based on actual experience and
business developments. The Meridian
59Table of Contents
projections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Meridian’s revenue, margin and expense, and other
performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are difficult
to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond Meridian’s control. Multiple factors, including those described in
the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” could cause the Meridian projections or the
underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Meridian projections will be realized or that actual results will
not be significantly higher or lower than projected. Because the Meridian projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less
reliable with each successive year. The Meridian projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they
were prepared, including the merger. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of
uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Meridian projections will be achieved. As a result, the inclusion of the Meridian projections in this
proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Meridian or any other person that the information is material. The summary of the
Meridian projections is not provided to influence Meridian shareholders’ decisions regarding whether to vote for the merger proposal or any other
proposal. The Meridian projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained
in Meridian’s public filings with the SEC.
The prospective financial information, including the Meridian projections, were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The prospective financial information,
including the Meridian projections, included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Meridian’s management. Ernst
& Young LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial
information, including the Meridian projections, and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with
respect thereto. Any Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Meridian’s previously issued financial
statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information, including the Meridian projections, and should not be read to do so.

Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP), LTM EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures
should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply
to non-GAAP financial measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the Meridian projections) in connection with a proposed transaction like
the merger when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP
financial measures were not relied upon by

For purposes of Rothschild & Co preparing its opinion dated July 6, 2022, Meridian’s management instructed Rothschild & Co to use the Updated
Meridian projections reflecting Meridian’s actual performance through May 31, 2022. Actual performance through May 31, 2022 was lower than the
forecast for such time period included in the Updated Meridian projections. Meridian management did not adjust the Updated Meridian projections for
the month of June 2022, but because the Updated Meridian projections were prepared on quarterly basis, used one-third of the projected amounts for
the quarter ended June 30, 2022 for the month of June 2022. Using actual and estimated performance through June 30, 2022 resulted in (i) 2022E total
revenue of $346 million (compared to $351 million in the Updated Meridian projections), (ii) gross profit of $202 million (compared to $209 million in the
Updated Meridian projections) and (iii) adj. EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $102 million (compared to $108 million in the Updated Meridian projections).
These actual and estimated financial performance numbers had no effect on the Updated Meridian projections for 2023E, 2024E, 2025E, 2026E, or
2027E.

Rothschild & Co for purposes of its opinion or by the Meridian Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. Accordingly, Meridian has not
provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Meridian projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
The Meridian projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Meridian of the merger and do not attempt to predict or
suggest future results following the merger. The Meridian projections do not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating, executing,
delivering or consummating the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the merger, the effect on Meridian of
any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed or the effect of any
business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered,
accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Meridian projections do not take into account the effect on Meridian of any
possible failure of the merger to occur.
For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after any portion of the Meridian projections was
prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted
reliance on the Meridian projections set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any investor or shareholder regarding the
information included in the Meridian projections. Neither Meridian nor any of its affiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness,
accuracy or completeness of the Meridian projections. Meridian urges all Meridian shareholders to review Meridian’s most recent SEC filings for a
description of its reported financial results. In addition, the Meridian projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after
the date the Meridian projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Meridian
does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Meridian projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date
when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.

In considering the recommendation of the Meridian Board that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR” the named executive officer merger-
related compensation proposal on a non-binding advisory basis, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the
merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meridian shareholders generally, as more fully described below. The Meridian Board
was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger
agreement and the merger, in approving the merger agreement and in recommending the applicable merger-related proposals.
The following discussion sets forth certain of these interests in the merger for each person who has served as an executive officer or non-employee
director of Meridian at any time since October 1, 2020.
i.
Treatment of Meridian Equity Awards
If the merger is completed, Meridian equity awards held by Meridian’s executive officers, including the named executive officers, and directors will be
cancelled and cashed out as follows:
1.
Stock Options
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Meridian common stock granted under the Meridian stock plans,
whether vested or unvested, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of

Executive Officer Severance Arrangements
1.
Employment Agreement with Jack Kenny
As of October 1, 2019, Meridian entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Jack Kenny (the “Kenny employment agreement”),
pursuant to which Mr. Kenny serves as Meridian’s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Kenny also serves as a member of the Meridian Board.
Under the Kenny employment agreement, in the event that Mr. Kenny’s employment is terminated by Meridian without “cause” or Mr. Kenny terminates
his employment for “good reason” (each as defined in the Kenny employment agreement), Mr. Kenny will be entitled to (i) continued base salary at his
then-current base salary rate for one year following such termination, payable in accordance with Meridian’s normal payroll practices and (ii) a lump sum
payment in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion of Mr. Kenny’s target annual bonus during the year of such termination, payable on the date that
annual bonuses are paid to similarly situated executives.
In addition, if, within 24 months following a “change in control” (as defined in the Kenny employment agreement and which includes the merger), Mr.
Kenny’s employment is terminated by Meridian without cause or due to a failure of Meridian to renew the Kenny employment agreement, or if Mr. Kenny
terminates employment for good reason, then upon such termination, Mr. Kenny will receive the following severance payments and benefits (in lieu of
those mentioned above):
•
a lump sum payment equal to two times Mr. Kenny’s then-current annual base salary;
•
a lump sum payment equal to two times Mr. Kenny’s then-current annual target bonus amount (or, if higher, Mr. Kenny’s annual target
bonus amount as in effect in the calendar year preceding the change in control); and
•
24 months’ continuation of such benefits and employment privileges and/or perquisites as are afforded to other senior officers of Meridian.
In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in the agreement or otherwise payable to Mr. Kenny would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the benefits under the agreement will be either delivered in full or delivered to a lesser extent
which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever is more beneficial to Mr. Kenny.
65
Table of Contents
The receipt of any severance payments and benefits pursuant to the Kenny employment agreement is conditioned on Mr. Kenny signing and not
revoking a general release of claims against Meridian. In addition, the Kenny employment agreement subjects Mr. Kenny to the following restrictive
covenants: (i) perpetual confidentiality, (ii) perpetual non-disparagement and (iii) non-competition and non-solicitation during employment and for two
years following any termination of employment.
For quantification of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Mr. Kenny in the event of a qualifying
termination immediately following the merger, see the section entitled “—Golden Parachute Compensation.”
2.
Change in Control Agreements
Meridian has entered into change in control agreements, which we refer to as “CIC agreements,” with the following executive officers: Dr. Lourdes
Weltzien, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Life Science; Mr. Tony Serafini-Lamanna, Executive Vice President, Diagnostics; and Mr. Andrew Kitzmiller,
Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the “participating executives”). The agreements include an initial term that (i) ended December 31, 2016 for Dr.
Weltzien, (ii) ended December 31, 2021 for Mr. Serafini-Lamanna, and (iii) ends December 31, 2022 for Mr. Kitzmiller, and, in each case, the term
automatically renews for additional one year periods; provided, however, that in the event of a “change in control” (as defined in the CIC agreements and
which includes the merger), the CIC agreements will expire no earlier than 24 months after the calendar month in which such change in control occurs.
Under the CIC agreements, if, within 24 months following a change in control, the executive’s employment with Meridian is terminated for any reason
other than (a) by Meridian for “cause” (as defined in the CIC agreements), (b) by reason of the executive’s death or disability, or (c) by the executive
without “good reason” (as defined in the CIC agreements), then, subject to the executive’s execution of a release of claims against Meridian, such
executive is entitled to:
•
a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the executive’s then-current annual base salary (or, if higher and as applicable, the annual base
salary as of immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event constituting good reason);
•
a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the executive’s then-current annual target bonus amount;
•
a lump sum cash payment for all of the executive’s earned but unused vacation time; and
•
24 months’ continuation of such benefits and employment privileges and/or perquisites as are afforded to other senior officers of Meridian.
The CIC agreements also provide that, upon any termination of employment following a change in control and during the term of the CIC agreement, each
participating executive is entitled to such executive’s annual bonus for the previously completed fiscal year to the extent unpaid.
In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in the CIC agreements or otherwise payable to a participating executive would be subject
to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such severance and/or benefits will be either delivered in full or delivered to a
lesser extent which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever is more beneficial to the executive.
For quantification of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Meridian’s applicable named executive
officers in the event of a qualifying termination immediately following the merger, see the section entitled “—Golden Parachute Compensation.”
3.
Meridian Severance Practice
Meridian does not have a formal severance policy, but in accordance with Meridian’s past practice for executives at comparable levels, Meridian
anticipates that Julie Smith would receive the following severance payments and
66
Table of Contents
benefits upon a qualifying termination, with the amounts of such benefits and the circumstances constituting a qualifying termination to be determined in
the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of Meridian:
•
a lump sum cash payment equal to a portion of her then-current annual base salary plus a prorated portion of her then-current annual
target bonus;
•
outplacement services for a certain period of time, likely not exceeding 12 months; and
•
continuation of certain health and welfare benefits for a certain period of time, likely not exceeding 12 months.
iii.
Meridian Transaction Bonus Arrangements
In connection with the completion of the merger, Andrew Kitzmiller and Julie Smith will receive cash-based transaction bonuses payable at closing in
amounts equal to $150,000 and $50,000, respectively.
iv.
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the surviving company in the merger will assume all specified rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time, existing in favor of Meridian’s directors and officers. For a
period of six years after the effective time, Columbus Holding has agreed to, and has agreed to cause the articles of incorporation and code of regulations
or similar organizational documents of the surviving company to contain provisions no less favorable to Meridian’s directors and officers with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of the merger agreement in Meridian’s constituent
documents.
Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub have agreed, and have agreed to cause the surviving company to indemnify and hold harmless each of
Meridian’s directors and officers with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), for six years after the effective
time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the
request of or for the benefit of Meridian).
For a period of six years after the effective time, Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub will cause to be maintained (or provide substitute policies) a six-
year “tail policy” with reputable insurers on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Meridian and its subsidiaries as of the date the merger agreement.
Such indemnification, advancement of expenses and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Directors’
and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.”
v.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about
certain compensation for each of Meridian’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, which we refer to as “merger-
based compensation,” and assumes, among other things, that each named executive officer incurs a qualifying termination of employment immediately
following completion of the merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments described below, see the discussion under the section
entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Meridian’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Please note that the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the
relevant date, including assumptions described below, and do not reflect
67
Table of Contents
certain compensation actions that may occur before the completion of the merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become
payable to Meridian’s named executive officers may differ materially from the amounts set forth below. For purposes of calculating such amounts,
rounded to the nearest whole dollar, we have assumed:
•
a hypothetical closing date of November 1, 2022 (solely for purposes of these calculations);
•
none of Meridian’s named executive officers receive any additional equity awards following September 2, 2022;
•
a termination of each named executive officer’s employment under circumstances entitling certain of the named executive officers to
severance benefits immediately following the merger; and
•
a transaction price of $34.00 per share.

Cash. Amounts in this column reflect the lump-sum severance payments that the named executive officers would be entitled to receive pursuant to
either the Kenny employment agreement or a CIC agreement, each as applicable and described above in the section entitled “—Executive Officer
Severance Arrangements.” These amounts are “double trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination within 24 months following
a change in control of Meridian in accordance with the provisions of the applicable agreement, subject to the execution of a release of claims. The
amount for Mr. Kenny consists of a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of (i) two times Mr. Kenny’s then-current annual base
salary; and (ii) two times Mr. Kenny’s then-current annual target bonus amount (or, if higher, Mr. Kenny’s annual target bonus in effect in the
calendar year preceding the change in control). Mr. Kenny would also be entitled to receive payment equal to the value of his earned but unused
vacation time. The amounts for Mr. Kitzmiller, Dr. Weltzien and Mr. Serafini-Lamanna consist of a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the
sum of (i) two times the executive officer’s then-current annual base salary (or, if higher and as applicable, the annual base salary as of immediately
prior to the first occurrence of an event constituting good reason); (ii) two times the executive officer’s then-current annual target bonus amount;
and (iii) the executive officer’s earned but unused vacation time.
For purposes of estimating the value of accrued but unused vacation time, the amounts included in the table below reflect a value equal to the product of
(i) each named executive officer’s aggregate maximum potential hours of accrued but unused vacation and paid time off as of November 1, 2022, and (ii)
such executive’s effective hourly pay rate.

Equity. Amounts in this column reflect the lump sum payments due to the named executive officers in connection with the merger as a result of the
cancellation of the outstanding Meridian equity awards, assuming solely for purposes of these calculations a hypothetical closing date of
November 1, 2022 and a transaction price of $34.00 per share. These amounts are “single trigger” and payable upon completion of the merger
pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreement and in accordance with or as permitted by, as applicable, the relevant Meridian plan documents
and award agreements. As described in more detail above in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Treatment of Meridian Equity
Awards,” all outstanding Meridian stock options, restricted share units and performance share units granted under the Meridian stock plans,
including those held by the named executive officers will be converted into a right to receive (i) in the case of stock options, cash payment equal to
the product of (x) the total number of shares of Meridian common stock subject to such option and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger
consideration over the exercise price per share of Meridian common stock set forth in such option, (ii) in the case of restricted share units, the
merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the number of shares of Meridian common stock
underlying such Meridian restricted share units, and (iii) in the case of performance share units, the merger consideration in respect of a number of
shares of Meridian common stock equal to the number of shares of Meridian common stock determined as if the applicable performance goals had
been achieved for the measurement period at the target level of performance.
The following table sets out the value payable to the named executive officers with respect to the cancellation of Meridian’s stock options, restricted
share units and performance share units based on a transaction price of $34.00 per share. The values set forth below with respect to Jack Kenny and
Tony Serafini-Lamanna do not include the value of certain Meridian restricted share units outstanding as of September 2, 2022, that, subject to each of
Mr. Kenny and Mr. Serafini-Lamanna’s satisfaction of the terms of their applicable award agreements, will have vested in the ordinary course and have
been settled in shares of Meridian common stock prior to a hypothetical closing date of November 1, 2022. Specifically, the amounts below do not include
(i) a value of $3,383,170 with respect to 99,505 Meridian restricted share units held by Mr. Kenny that are scheduled to vest in the ordinary course on
October 1, 2022 and (ii) a value of $40,800 with respect to 1,200 Meridian restricted share units held by Mr. Serafini-Lamanna that are scheduled to vest in
the ordinary course on September 16, 2022, assuming for these purposes a value of $34.00 per share.

Tax Reimbursements. The named executive officers are not entitled to tax reimbursements or gross-ups in connection with the merger. The CIC
agreements and the Kenny employment agreement contain elective net-better Section 280G cutback provisions, which provide that, in the event
that the severance and other benefits provided for in the named executive officer’s applicable agreement or otherwise payable to such named
executive officer would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such severance and/or benefits will be
either delivered in full or delivered to a lesser extent which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever is
more beneficial to the named executive officer.

Other. Mr. Kitzmiller is entitled to a transaction bonus in an amount equal to $150,000, payable at closing.

The Golden Parachute Compensation Table includes values associated with certain equity arrangements held by Dr. Weltzien. Absent the merger
and pursuant to Meridian’s retirement policy, Dr. Weltzien is retirement eligible and would be entitled to vest in all of her outstanding equity awards
upon her retirement.
(7)
Mr. Baldasare retired from his employment with Meridian on December 31, 2021. In connection with the merger, Mr. Baldasare will become entitled to
a cash payment in an amount equal to $176,435 with respect to his 11,669 unexercised Meridian stock options (for more details regarding the
treatment of Meridian stock options in the merger, see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Treatment of Meridian Equity Awards”). Mr.
Baldasare is not otherwise entitled to any additional compensation or benefits in connection with the merger.

Potential Future Employment
The buyer consortium has proposed, on a preliminary basis, to each of Messrs. Kenny, Kitzmiller, Serafini- Lamanna, and Dr. Weltzien continued
employment with the surviving company after the closing of the merger as well as an opportunity to invest a certain amount of such executive officers’
after-tax merger consideration into preferred stock of the surviving company. Consequently, if the buyer consortium and such executive officers of
Meridian finalize the terms of those proposals and such executive officers of Meridian enter into arrangements with the buyer consortium or their
affiliates, they will be employed with the surviving company following the closing of the merger and may have the right to purchase or participate in the
equity of the surviving company.",70,78

CFIUS Approval. The merger is subject to CFIUS approval, which requires that Meridian and Columbus Holding: have received written notice from

agreement, or (ii) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the United States requesting the President’s decision on the CFIUS notice submitted by
Meridian and Columbus Holding and either (A) the period under the DPA during which the President may announce his decision to take action to
suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has expired without any such action being
threatened, announced or taken or (B) the President has announced a decision not to take any action to suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The parties submitted a formal draft filing relating to the merger to CFIUS on August 19, 2022, and
received comments from CFIUS on August 30, 2022.
Foreign Regulatory Clearances. The parties have also filed merger notifications on August 19, 2022, pursuant to foreign antitrust and foreign investment
laws and completion of the merger is further conditioned upon:
•
receipt of a clearance or non-objection from the German Federal Cartel Office and the Romanian Competition Council, or expiration of the
applicable waiting periods, or alternatively, if the matter is referred to the European Union, receipt of clearance or non-objection from the
European Union, or expiration of the applicable waiting period;

Foreign Trade and Payment Ordinance of 2 August 2013, as amended by Article 2 of the Ordinance of 25 August 2021.
At any time, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the laws of their jurisdictions, which could include
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action
under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if
such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful. For more information about regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.”
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and
approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the

Under Ohio law, holders of record of Meridian common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly
demand payment of fair cash value of their shares are entitled to certain dissenters’ rights pursuant to Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL if the
merger is completed. Shareholders holding Meridian common stock considering seeking payment of the fair cash value of their shares should be aware
that the fair cash value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of
the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek payment of fair cash value of their shares. To be entitled to such
payment, a Meridian shareholder must, among other things, deliver to Meridian a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of the shares held by
such shareholder with the information provided for in Section 1701.85(A)(4) of the OGCL before the vote to adopt the merger agreement is taken, not vote
in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and otherwise comply with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures
set forth in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL will result in the loss of dissenters’ rights. Please see the section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights” and

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not
contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete
text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the merger.
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The following summary of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A to this proxy statement, is intended solely to provide
investors with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about
Meridian in its public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the merger agreement and the related summary are not intended to be, and should not
be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to the parties or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. The merger
agreement contains representations and warranties by Meridian, SDB, Columbus Holding and Merger Sub. The representations, warranties and
covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by
the contracting parties, including being qualified by the disclosure letter to the merger agreement made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk
between the parties to the merger agreement, and may apply contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect that generally differ from
those applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change
after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Meridian’s public disclosures. You should not
rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Meridian, SDB, SJL or Columbus Holding, because
the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by
the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public.
Additional information about Meridian may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Meridian’s other public filings. See “Where You Can Find

MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,Structure of the Merger,"Structure of the Merger
At the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Meridian. Meridian will continue as the surviving company such that following the merger,
Meridian will continue its corporate existence under Ohio law as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding. Upon completion of the merger,
we anticipate that SDB will own approximately 60% of Columbus Holding and SJL will control (directly or through its affiliate) a special purpose vehicle
that will own approximately 40% of Columbus Holding. The articles of incorporation and the code of regulations of Meridian as in effect immediately prior
to the effective time, will be amended and restated as of the effective time, in the case of the articles of incorporation, to be the form attached as an exhibit
to the merger agreement, and in the case of the code of regulations, to be in the form of the code of regulations of Merger Sub, and as so amended will be
the code of regulations of the surviving company except that all references therein to Merger Sub will be automatically amended and will become
references to the surviving company. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be, as of the effective time, the directors of
the surviving company until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. The
officers of Meridian immediately prior to the effective time will be, as of the effective time, the officers of the surviving company until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by Meridian and Columbus Holding, the closing of the merger will be held and conducted remotely by

counterparts and countersignatures), in no event later than the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the
merger agreement and described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger” (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).
The merger will become effective at such date and time as the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio or at such later
date or time as may be agreed by Meridian and Columbus Holding in writing and specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the OGCL.
As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. However, completion of the merger is
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, which are described below and include various regulatory
clearances and approvals, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Meridian or Columbus Holding could delay the completion of the merger,
or prevent it from being completed at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We
expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.

At the effective time, each share of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares that are
cancelled under the merger agreement, any options or other rights granted under Meridian stock plans, or dissenting shares), will be cancelled,
extinguished, and converted into the right to receive $34.00 per share of Meridian common stock in cash, without interest. All such shares, when so
converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and cease to exist.
At the effective time, each share of Meridian common stock held in the treasury of Meridian, each share of Meridian common stock owned by Columbus
Holding, Merger Sub or Meridian or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries immediately before the effective time, and any
dissenting shares will be cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect to such shares (other than
payments in respect of dissenting shares). Shares of Meridian common stock owned by Meridian shareholders who have not voted in favor of or
consented to the adoption of the merger agreement and who are entitled to demand and have properly demanded appraisal and payment of the fair cash
value of such shares pursuant to, and who comply in all respects with, Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, will not be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration. Such Meridian shareholders will instead be entitled to the dissenters’ rights granted by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, as
described in more detail in the section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights.”
Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time will, after the effective time, represent one share
of common stock of the surviving company and will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving company.

Columbus Holding will deposit or cause to be deposited, in trust, with Meridian’s paying agent (or another U.S. national bank or trust company that is
reasonably satisfactory to Meridian) and pursuant to a paying agent agreement in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Columbus Holding and
Meridian, cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the aggregate merger consideration to which the holders of shares of Meridian
common stock and other equity-based awards are entitled at the effective time.

consideration a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates will pass, only upon proper
delivery of the certificates to the paying agent or for book-entry shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal which will
be in customary form) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates or for book-entry shares, the surrender of such book-entry
shares via an “agent’s message” in customary form in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of record of one or more certificates may
thereafter surrender such certificates to the paying agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Each holder of one or more
book-entry shares may thereafter surrender such book-entry shares upon delivery to the paying agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (or
such other evidence, if any, as the paying agent may reasonably request).
If any certificate representing shares of Meridian common stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Columbus Holding or the surviving company, as the case may be, the
posting by such person of an indemnity agreement or, at the election of Columbus Holding or the paying agent, a bond in such customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or SDB with respect to such certificate, the paying agent will, if such holder has otherwise
delivered a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate, the merger
consideration that would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the merger agreement.
No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash or other consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise upon the surrender of
certificates or book-entry shares that immediately before the effective time represented shares of Meridian common stock. Any portion of the funds
deposited with the paying agent for payment to Meridian shareholders that remains undistributed to the former Meridian shareholders for one year after
the effective time will, upon Columbus Holding’s demand to the paying agent, be delivered to Columbus Holding. Any former holder of Meridian common
stock will thereafter look only to Columbus Holding for payment of the merger consideration.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, none of Meridian nor any of its subsidiaries is prohibited from amending, modifying or granting any waiver or release

outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Meridian Board
under applicable law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, if Meridian receives a bona fide written takeover proposal after the date of
the merger agreement that did not result from a breach of the merger agreement, then Meridian and its representatives may make inquiries solely to
ascertain facts regarding, and clarify the terms of, such written takeover proposal for the purpose of the Meridian Board informing itself about such

such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Meridian Board under applicable law and that such takeover
proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. Substantially contemporaneously with providing any nonpublic
information to such person(s), Meridian will make such non-public information available to Columbus Holding if it has not already been made.
Meridian will inform Columbus Holding promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt thereof) of its receipt of any written inquiry, proposal or
offer with respect to any takeover proposal received after the date of the merger agreement and any written request for non-public information in
connection therewith (indicating the identity of the person making the inquiry or proposal and the material terms of any such proposal, including
providing copies of any company acquisition agreement and any other relevant transaction documents) and thereafter will keep Columbus Holding
reasonably informed of any material developments regarding any takeover proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any material
development). In the event that any person modifies its takeover proposal in any material respect, Meridian will notify Columbus Holding in writing
within 48 hours of receipt of such modification of the fact that such takeover proposal has been modified and the terms of such modification (including, if
applicable, providing copies of written documentation reflecting such modification). Meridian has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will not enter into any

Holding in accordance with the merger agreement.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means a bona fide written takeover proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of “takeover proposal” to “20%” are replaced by “60%”) made by a person on terms that the Meridian Board or a duly formed
and authorized committee thereof determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into
account all factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Meridian Board, including financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the
transaction described in such proposal (including any termination fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to completion), would, if
completed, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Meridian common stock than the transactions.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “takeover proposal” means, other than the transactions, any offer or proposal (other than from Columbus Holding,
Merger Sub, SDB, SJL, or any of their respective affiliates) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (i) any acquisition or
purchase, direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Meridian and its subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of
Meridian, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if completed, would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of Meridian, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, asset sale, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Meridian or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group would own,
directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the surviving entity in a merger involving Meridian or the resulting direct or indirect
parent of Meridian or such surviving entity (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power) after

in such binding offer were to be given effect; provided, however, that if, during such four business day period, any material revisions are
made to the superior proposal, the Meridian Board will give a new written notice to Columbus Holding and will comply with the
requirements of the merger agreement with respect to such new written notice (provided, that the notice period will be two business days
instead of four business days), and

such company employee was eligible to receive prior to the closing to the extent comparable long-term incentive compensation is not provided to such

benefits provided to each such company employee immediately before the effective time.
Columbus Holding has agreed to maintain in effect and make payment under all annual bonus plans that were in effect as of immediately prior to the

Mutual Termination Right
The merger agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the effective time by the mutual written consent of Meridian and Columbus
Holding.
Termination Rights Exercisable by Either Meridian or Columbus Holding
The merger agreement may be terminated prior to the effective time by either Meridian or Columbus Holding if:
•
the merger has not been completed on or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 6, 2023 (the “outside date”) provided, that if, on the
outside date, all of the closing conditions (except those relating to antitrust or foreign direct investment approvals) have been satisfied or
waived, then the outside date will automatically be extended to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 6, 2023, which we refer to as “first outside
date extension”; provided, further, that if, on the first outside date extension, all of the closing conditions (except those relating to antitrust
or foreign direct investment approvals) have been satisfied or waived, then the outside date will be further extended to 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time on July 6, 2023, and such date as so extended will be the outside date; provided, however, that the right to terminate the merger
agreement will not be available to any party that has breached any provision of the merger agreement; and provided, further, that such
breach primarily caused the failure to consummate the merger;
•
any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, judgement, decree or other order of any governmental entity, which is
final and nonappealable, has been issued or taken, which restraint is permanently restraining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
completion of the merger, such that the corresponding condition set forth in the merger agreement cannot be satisfied; or
•
the shareholders’ meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) concluded without obtaining the required shareholder
approval for adoption of the merger agreement.
Meridian Termination Rights
Meridian may also terminate the merger agreement:
•
prior to the receipt of shareholder approval for adoption of the merger agreement, in order to concurrently enter into an acquisition
agreement with respect to a superior proposal; provided that Meridian has complied with its obligations in the merger agreement in
connection with such superior proposal in all material respects, and paid the termination fee to Columbus Holding pursuant to the terms of
the merger agreement;
•
if there has been a breach of any of the covenants or failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties on the part of Columbus
Holding, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate (1) would result in a failure of the conditions to SDB’s or
Columbus Holding’s obligations to complete the merger to be satisfied and (2) which is not cured prior to the earlier of (a) the outside date
or (b) 30 days following written notice of such breach to Columbus Holding; provided that (i) Meridian has given Columbus Holding written
notice, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination (or promptly, if such notice is given within 30 days prior to the outside date),
stating Meridian’s intention to terminate the merger agreement pursuant thereto and the basis for such
89Table of Contents
termination and (ii) Meridian will not have the right to terminate the merger agreement if Meridian is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement; or
•
if (1) the conditions relating to SDB’s or Columbus Holding’s obligations to complete the merger (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing; provided that each such condition is then capable of being satisfied at a closing
on such date, assuming for purposes hereof that the date of termination is the closing date), have been satisfied or waived, (2) Meridian has
confirmed to Columbus Holding in writing that Meridian is ready, willing and able to consummate the merger, and (3) Columbus Holding,
SDB and Merger Sub fail to consummate the merger within five business days after the later of (a) the date the closing should have
occurred and (b) the delivery by Meridian to Columbus Holding of such notice.
Columbus Holding Termination Rights
Columbus Holding may also terminate the merger agreement:
•
if the Meridian Board or committee thereof has made a change in recommendation (with such termination right only exercisable within 10
business days after such change in recommendation and prior to the time at which Meridian shareholders adopt the merger agreement);
•
if there has been a breach of any of the covenants or failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties on the part of Meridian
which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate (1) would result in a failure of the conditions to Meridian’s
obligations to complete the merger to be satisfied and (2) which is not cured prior to the earlier of (a) the outside date or (b) 30 days
following written notice of such breach to Meridian; provided that (i) Columbus Holding has given Meridian written notice, delivered at
least 30 days prior to such termination (or promptly, if such notice is given within 30 days prior to the outside date), stating Columbus
Holding’s intention to terminate the merger agreement pursuant thereto and the basis for such termination and (ii) Columbus Holding will
not have the right to terminate the merger agreement if Columbus Holding is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement; or
•
the DOJ has indicted Meridian or any of its subsidiaries on one or more felony criminal charges as result of the DOJ Investigation, other
than in connection with a negotiated resolution of the DOJ Investigation by Meridian in connection with the entry into or proposed entry
into a deferred prosecution agreement, or Meridian or any of its subsidiaries has been excluded from any Federal health care program;
provided, that in the event that Meridian provides written notice to Columbus Holding of such occurrence, this termination right must be
exercised within five business days following the receipt of such notice by Columbus Holding.
A terminating party must provide written notice of termination to the other parties specifying with reasonable particularity the reason for such
termination. If more than one termination provision of the merger agreement is available to a terminating party in connection with a termination, a
terminating party may rely on any and all such available provisions for any such termination.",97,98

Meridian has agreed to pay to Columbus Holding the termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated:
•
by Columbus Holding if, before Meridian receives the requisite shareholder approval for adoption of the merger agreement, the Meridian
Board or committee thereof has made a change in recommendation (with such right of termination exercisable by Columbus Holding for a
period of 10 business days after such change in recommendation), or if either Columbus Holding or Meridian terminates the merger
agreement for any reason at such time as Columbus Holding could have terminated the merger agreement in the foregoing circumstances
described in this bullet point;

•
by Columbus Holding if Meridian has breached its non-solicitation covenants in the merger agreement described under “The Merger
Agreement—Non-Solicitation Covenant,” in a manner that would result in a failure of a condition to the completion of the merger, and such
breach is not cured prior to the earlier of the outside date and 30 days following Columbus Holding providing written notice to Meridian
stating its intention to terminate the merger agreement and the basis for such termination (except that Columbus Holding may not terminate
the merger agreement under these circumstances if it is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements in the merger agreement);
•
by Meridian prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Meridian shareholders, in order to concurrently enter into an acquisition
agreement with respect to a superior proposal, provided that Meridian has complied with its non-solicitation covenants in connection with
such superior proposal in all material respects; or

by either Columbus Holding or Meridian under certain circumstances if the merger has not been completed on or before the outside date or
if the shareholders’ meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) concluded without obtaining the required vote for
Meridian shareholder adoption of the merger agreement, and in the case of such termination (1) prior to such termination any person
publicly announces a takeover proposal or a takeover proposal becomes publicly known (which prior to such termination, in the case of a
termination due to the merger not being completed prior to the outside date, or at least three business days prior to the special meeting, in
the case of a termination due to shareholder approval of the adoption of the merger agreement not being obtained, has not been withdrawn),
and (2) at any time on or prior to the 12-month anniversary of such termination Meridian consummates a transaction that constitutes a
takeover proposal relating to 50% of Meridian’s shares or assets with the person that made the takeover proposal or enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to a takeover proposal relating to 50% of Meridian’s shares or assets with the person that made the takeover
proposal.
In the case of termination by Columbus Holding, the termination fee shall be paid within two business days after such termination. In the case of
termination by Meridian, the termination fee shall be paid prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination; provided, however, in the case of
the last bullet above, the Company will pay the termination fee upon the first to occur of the completion of, or entry into a definitive agreement with
respect to, the applicable takeover proposal. In no event will Meridian be obligated to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion.
Further, Columbus Holding’s receipt of the termination fee from Meridian will constitute liquidated damages, and from and after payment of such
termination fee, Meridian will not have further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with the merger agreement or the termination
contemplated thereby.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Rule 14a-21(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act requires that Meridian seek a
non-binding advisory vote from Meridian shareholders to approve the merger-related compensation described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
“The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Meridian’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 62, and including the table therein
titled “Golden Parachute Compensation” (as well as the other supporting footnotes and tables therein) intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation
S-K, which requires disclosure of information about compensation for each Meridian named executive officer that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger and will or may become payable by Meridian. This proposal is commonly known as “say-on-golden-parachutes,” and we refer to it as the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.
The Meridian Board unanimously recommends that the Meridian shareholders approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Meridian Bioscience, Inc. (“Meridian”) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Meridian that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading ‘The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Meridian’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger’.”
Approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and the vote with respect
to the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only and will not be binding on Meridian. If the merger proposal is
adopted by the Meridian shareholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation will be payable to Meridian’s named executive
officers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal.
The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Meridian common stock present or represented by proxy at the Meridian special
meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the advisory (non-binding) named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.
The Meridian Board unanimously recommends that the Meridian shareholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation proposal by
voting “FOR” the compensation proposal.

Meridian shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give us authority to adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the
merger agreement. If this adjournment proposal, after consultation with Columbus Holding, is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by the

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS",102,103
MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS,"DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS
Under Ohio law, if the merger agreement is adopted by Meridian’s shareholders, Meridian shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and who properly demand payment of fair cash value of their shares are entitled to certain dissenters’ rights pursuant to Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL. Section 1701.85 of the OGCL generally provides that Meridian shareholders will not be entitled to such rights without
strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, and failure to timely take any one of the required steps may result in the
termination or waiver of such rights. Specifically, any Meridian shareholder who is a record holder of Meridian common stock on September 2, 2022, the
record date for the special meeting, and whose shares are not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement may be entitled to be paid the fair
cash value of such shares after the completion of the merger in lieu of any applicable merger consideration.
To perfect dissenters’ rights, a dissenting shareholder must satisfy each of the following conditions and otherwise comply with Section 1701.85 of the
OGCL:
•
Must be a shareholder of record. A dissenting shareholder must be a record holder of the shares as to which such shareholder seeks to
exercise dissenters’ rights on the record date. Because only share-holders of record on the record date may exercise dissenters’ rights, any
person or entity who beneficially owns shares that are held of record by a bank, broker, trust, fiduciary, 401(k) Plan, nominee or other
holder and who desires to exercise dissenters’ rights must, in all cases, instruct the record holder of the shares to satisfy all of the
requirements outlined under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Meridian may make a written request for evidence of authority if the
dissenting demand is executed by a signatory who was designated and approved by the shareholder. The shareholder must provide the
evidence within a reasonable time to Meridian but not sooner than 20 days after receipt of Meridian’s written request.
•
Must not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. A dissenting shareholder must not vote his, her or its shares in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting. Failing to vote does not waive a dissenting shareholder’s dissenters’ rights.
However, a proxy submitted but not marked to specify voting instructions will be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
and will be deemed a waiver of dissenters’ rights. A dissenting shareholder may revoke his, her or its proxy at any time before its exercise by
filing with Meridian an instrument revoking it, delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, voting by telephone or via the Internet
at a later date than the date of the previous proxy or by attending and giving notice of the revocation of the proxy at the special meeting.
•
Must file a written demand. A dissenting shareholder must deliver a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of such
shareholder’s shares to Meridian prior to the shareholder vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting (a “written demand”). Any
written demand must specify the shareholder’s name and address, the number and class of the shares held by the shareholder on the record
date, and the amount claimed by the shareholder as the fair cash value of the dissenting shares. Voting against the merger agreement is not
a written demand as required under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Because the written demand must be delivered to Meridian prior to the
shareholder vote at the special meeting, it is recommended, although it is not required, that a shareholder use certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, to confirm that the shareholder has made a timely delivery.
•
Upon request, must deliver certificates for placement of a legend. If Meridian sends a request to a dissenting shareholder at the address
specified in the written demand for the certificates representing the dissenting shares, the dissenting shareholder, within 15 days from the
date on which Meridian sends such request, must deliver to Meridian the certificates requested so that Meridian may endorse on them a
legend to the effect that demand for the fair cash value of such shares has been made. Such a request is not an admission by Meridian that
a dissenting shareholder is entitled to relief. Meridian will promptly return the endorsed share certificates to the dissenting shareholder. At
the option of Meridian,
95Table of Contents
a dissenting shareholder who fails to deliver his, her or its share certificates upon request from Meridian may have his, her or its dissenters’
rights terminated upon de-livery by Meridian of written notice to such dissenting shareholder within 20 days after the lapse of the 15-day
period, unless a court for good cause shown otherwise directs.
Meridian and a dissenting shareholder may come to an agreement as to the fair cash value of the dissenting shares. If Meridian and the dissenting
shareholder cannot agree upon the fair cash value of the dissenting shares, then either Meridian or the dissenting shareholder may, within three months
after service of the written demand by the dissenting shareholder, file a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio for a
determination of whether the dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any shares and, if so, the number and class of such
shares. The complaint must contain a brief statement of the facts, including the vote and the facts entitling the dissenting shareholder to the relief
demanded. If the court finds the dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any dissenting shares, the court may appoint one or
more appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the amount of the fair cash value. The court will then make a finding as to the fair cash
value of a share and will render judgment against Meridian for the payment of it. Interest on the fair cash value and the costs of the proceeding, including
reasonable compensation to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, will be assessed as the court considers equitable.
Fair cash value for purposes of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL is the amount that a willing seller who is under no compulsion to sell would be willing to
accept and that a willing buyer who is under no compulsion to purchase would be willing to pay, but in no event will the fair cash value exceed the
amount specified in the written demand of the dissenting shareholder. The fair cash value is to be determined as of the day prior to the vote of Meridian’s
shareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement. For shares listed on a national securities exchange (such as the NASDAQ, on which the Meridian
common stock is currently listed), the fair cash value will be the closing sale price of the shares as of the close of trading on the day before the vote of
Meridian’s shareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement. Investment banker opinions to company boards of directors regarding the fairness
from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction, such as the merger, are not opinions regarding, and do not address, fair cash
value under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Shareholders holding Meridian common stock considering seeking payment of the fair cash value of their
shares should be aware that the fair cash value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL could be more than, the same as, or
less than the value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek payment of fair cash value of their shares.
Unless a dissenting shareholder’s rights to receive the fair cash value of its shares is terminated, payment of the fair cash value must be made within 30
days after the later of the final determination of such value or the effective time of the merger. Such payment must be made only upon simultaneous
surrender to Meridian of the dissenting shareholder’s share certificates for which such payment is made.
A dissenting shareholder’s rights to receive the fair cash value of his, her or its shares will automatically terminate if:
•
The dissenting shareholder has not complied with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, unless the Meridian Board waives such non-compliance;
•
The merger is abandoned or is finally enjoined or prevented from being carried out, or Meridian shareholders rescind their adoption of the
merger agreement;
•
The dissenting shareholder withdraws his, her or its demand with the consent of the Meridian Board; or
•
The dissenting shareholder and Meridian have not agreed on the fair cash value per share and neither has filed a timely complaint in the
Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio within three months after the dissenting shareholder delivered a written demand.
All rights accruing to holders of shares, including voting and dividend or distribution rights, are suspended from the time a dissenting shareholder
submits a written demand with respect to any dissenting shares until the termination or satisfaction of the rights and obligations of the dissenting
shareholder and Meridian arising from
96
Table of Contents
the written demand or the purchase of the shares by Meridian. During this period of suspension, any dividend or distribution paid on the dissenting
shares will be paid to the record owner as a credit upon the fair cash value thereof. If dissenters’ rights are terminated other than by purchase by Meridian
of the dissenting shares, then at the time of termination all rights will be restored and all distributions that would have been made, but for suspension, will
be made.
If you wish to exercise your dissenters’ rights, you should carefully review the text of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL set forth in Annex C to
this proxy statement and consider consulting your legal advisor.
If you fail to timely and properly comply with the requirements of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, your dissenters’ rights will be lost. To
exercise such dissenters’ rights with respect to your shares, you must:
•
NOT vote your shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement (failing to vote does not waive a dissenting shareholder’s
dissenters’ rights, however, a proxy submitted but not marked to specify voting instructions will be voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and will be deemed a waiver of dissenters’ rights);
•
deliver to Meridian a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement at the special meeting, as described further below;
•
continuously hold your shares through the effective time of the merger; and
•
otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL.
All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Meridian Corporation at 3471 River Hills Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio, 45244. Such demand must specify
the shareholder’s name and address, that the shareholder intends thereby to demand dissenters’ rights of such shareholder’s shares, the number and
class of Meridian shares held by such shareholder on the record date and the amount claimed by such shareholder as the fair cash value of the
dissenting shares. Voting against the merger agreement is not a written demand as required under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL.
If a dissenting holder of Meridian common stock withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal pursuant to
the OGCL, then the right of such shareholder to be paid the fair cash value of such Meridian common stock shall cease, and such holder’s Meridian
common stock shall be deemed to be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.
The foregoing description of the procedures to be followed in exercising dissenters’ rights available to shareholders holding Meridian common stock
pursuant to Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL may not be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Sections 1701.84
and 1701.85 of the OGCL, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary does not
constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that shareholders exercise their dissenters’ rights under the OGCL.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL may result in the loss of a shareholder’s
dissenters’ rights.
In view of the complexity of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, Meridian shareholders who may wish to pursue dissenters’ rights should
consult their legal and financial advisors.

than five percent of Meridian common stock, based on information provided in their most recent filings with the SEC; (2) the named executed officers and

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",106,108
MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,"MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of Meridian
common stock whose shares are exchanged for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published
positions of the Internal Revenue Service, each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis,
and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Meridian common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or
the District of Columbia;
•
a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S.
persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury
Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of Meridian common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation
that may be relevant to a holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, dealers or
brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, U.S. holders that have a functional
currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, banks and certain other financial institutions,
mutual funds, certain expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or partners, shareholders or other owners or investors in
partnerships or such other pass-through entities, holders who hold shares of Meridian common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or
conversion transaction, and holders who acquired their shares of Meridian common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other
compensation arrangements). This discussion also does not address any tax consequences arising under the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax
on net investment income or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and
intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith). In addition, no information is provided with respect to any tax
consequences under state, local, or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of
Meridian common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the
partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding shares of Meridian common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.
Holders of Meridian common stock should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the merger, including
the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare contribution tax and any state, local, foreign or other tax
laws.
100Table of Contents
Consequences to U.S. Holders
The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Meridian common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives the merger consideration in
exchange for shares of Meridian common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.
If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Meridian common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger,
the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject
to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder
acquired different blocks of Meridian common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and
holding period separately with respect to each block of Meridian common stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Meridian common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information
reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption
should complete and return Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury that such U.S. holder is a “United States person”
(within the meaning of the Code), the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC_20220908_DEFM14A_20331967_4514903.Pdf,MULTIPLE SHAREHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS,"MULTIPLE SHAREHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and
annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable,
addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for
shareholders and cost savings for companies.
Meridian and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple shareholders who request a
copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your
broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you
revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please
notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Meridian if you are a shareholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written
request to Meridian’s Vice President, Investor Relations at mbi@meridianbioscience.com or 3471 River Hills Dr. Cincinnati, Ohio, 45244, or by calling (513)
271-3700. Shareholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single
copy by notifying Meridian at the telephone, email or address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Meridian will promptly deliver, upon written or
oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single
copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

Meridian’s 2023 Annual Meeting
If the merger is completed prior to Meridian’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, Meridian will not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2023 and
there will be no public participation in any future meetings of Meridian’s shareholders because, following the merger, Meridian common stock will be
delisted from the NASDAQ and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Meridian will no longer be a publicly held company. However, if the
merger is not completed prior to Meridian’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, the following deadlines apply to the submission of shareholder
proposals to be considered at Meridian’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.
Inclusion in Meridian’s 2023 Proxy Statement
To be included in the proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting, Meridian must have received proposals no later than August 17, 2022. Proposals for
inclusion in the proxy statement must comply with applicable requirements under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14a-8, as well as with Meridian’s
bylaws.
Presentation at Meridian’s 2023 Annual Meeting
Pursuant to Meridian’s bylaws, shareholders may present director nominations or other proposals that are proper subjects for consideration at an annual
meeting. Meridian’s bylaws require all shareholders who intend to make nominations or proposals at an annual shareholders meeting to submit their
nominations or proposals to Meridian not earlier than the 150th day nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting.
To be eligible for consideration at the currently planned 2023 annual meeting, such proposals that have not been submitted by the deadline for inclusion
in the proxy statement must be received by Meridian between August 22, 2022 and October 21, 2022.
Compliance with Universal Proxy Rules for Director Nominations
In addition to satisfying applicable requirements under Meridian’s bylaws, to comply with the SEC’s universal proxy rules, shareholders who intend to
solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than Meridian’s nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19
under the Exchange Act, which notice must be postmarked or transmitted electronically to Meridian at its principal executive offices no later than 60
calendar days prior to the anniversary date of Meridian’s 2022 annual meeting (for the 2023 annual meeting, no later than November 27, 2022). However, if
the date of Meridian’s 2023 annual meeting is changed by more than 30 calendar days from such anniversary date, then notice must be provided by the
later of 60 calendar days prior to the date of the 2023 annual meeting or the 10th calendar day following the day on which public announcement of the
date of the 2023 annual meeting is first made by Meridian.

ARTICLE II
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK
Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent Parties, the Company
or the holders of Shares or securities of the Parent Parties:
(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such Shares, other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.1(b), any Options or Share Units, which will each be treated as set forth in Section 2.3, and Dissenting Shares, which will be treated as set forth in
Section 2.4, the “Eligible Shares”) will be cancelled, extinguished, and converted into the right to receive $34.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”) upon surrender of either a certificate formerly representing such Share (a “Certificate”) or a book-entry Share (a “Book-Entry Share”) in
the manner provided in Section 2.2. All such Eligible Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired
and cease to exist. Upon the surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, each holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to such Eligible Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Eligible Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.
(b) Each (i) Share held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) Dissenting Share (clauses (i)-(iii) collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”) will be
cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect to such shares subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to
the right of the holder thereof to receive any payment under Section 2.4. This Section 2.1(b) will not apply to Shares held in trust by the Company, any of
the Parent Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Shares that are otherwise set aside from Shares held in the Company’s treasury pursuant
to a Company Plan.
(c) Each share of common stock, without par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value per share, of the Surviving Company and, thereafter,
will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company.

Section 2.2 Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books.
(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into an agreement with the Company’s transfer agent (or another U.S. national bank or trust company that
is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as agent for the holders of Eligible Shares in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to
receive the Merger Consideration necessary to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a). The Paying Agent will also act as the agent for the
holders of Eligible Shares for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares but will acquire no rights or interests in Shares
represented thereby. The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent appoints the Paying Agent will be in a form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent.
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited, in trust, with the Paying Agent, in a separate account for the benefit of
holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance with this Article II through the Paying Agent, cash in immediately available funds in an amount
equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(a). With respect to any
Dissenting Shares, Parent will be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares if the holder thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or losses its appraisal rights
under the OGCL. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay, and the Paying Agent will pay, the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Payment Fund upon satisfaction by a
holder of Eligible Shares of its obligations pursuant to Section 2.2(d). The Payment Fund will not be used for any other purpose, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent will hereinafter be referred to as the “Payment Fund.”
(c)
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event within two Business Days thereafter, Parent will cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter
of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in customary form) and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g)) or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares via an “agent’s message” in customary form in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each
holder of record of one or more Certificates may thereafter surrender such Certificates to the Paying Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal,
as agent for such holder. Each holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares may thereafter surrender such Book-Entry Shares upon delivery to the
Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request). Upon
delivery of a valid letter of transmittal and the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g) or
surrender of Book-Entry Shares, the Surviving Company will, subject to Section 2.2(e)), cause the Paying Agent to pay to each such holder of
Eligible Shares immediately available funds in the form of a check or wire transfer (as specified in the applicable letter of transmittal) in the amount
equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of the surrendered
Shares represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g)) or Book-Entry Shares. Until so
surrendered, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Cancelled Shares) will represent solely
the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g)) or Book-Entry Shares.
(ii) The payment of Merger Consideration or any other amount under this Article II that is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, is
Annex A-4
Table of Contents
conditioned on (A) the Certificate so surrendered being properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting
such payment having paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment being made in a name other than that of the registered
holder of such Certificate or having established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The
payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred by a holder of Shares in
connection with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, will be the sole
responsibility of such holder. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration will be made to the Person in
whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a transfer of ownership of Book-Entry Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company as of the Effective Time, the Paying Agent may make payment of the proper amount of aggregate Merger Consideration to such
transferee if written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Paying Agent together with all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of such Book-Entry Share have been paid or sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax is not applicable.
(d) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Eligible Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed immediately and there will not be any further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of any shares of the
Company’s capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing Cancelled Shares, except for Dissenting Shares which will be treated in accordance with
Section 2.4) or Book-Entry Shares (other than Book-Entry Shares representing Cancelled Shares, except for Dissenting Shares which will be treated in
accordance with Section 2.4) are presented to the Surviving Company, they will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash or other consideration payable pursuant to this Article II. or otherwise upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which immediately before the Effective Time represented the Shares.
(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Eligible Shares after the date that is the 12-month anniversary of
the Effective Time will, upon Parent’s demand to the Paying Agent, be delivered to Parent, and any such former holders of Eligible Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of their Eligible
Shares (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest on such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Parent Parties, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Surviving Company, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and the Paying
Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or
deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding
was made.
Annex A-5
Table of Contents
(g) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or, at
the election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in such customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or SDB with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will, if such holder has otherwise delivered a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal,
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the number of Shares formerly
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.
(h) The Paying Agent will invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash will
be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States of America; in
commercial paper obligations rated not less than two of P-1, A-1 or F-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Corporation or
Fitch’s Ratings, Inc., respectively, or investments in certificates of deposit, banker’s acceptances and time deposits and money market deposit accounts
issued or offered by any commercial bank organized under the law of the United States of America or any state thereof which has (A) not less than two of
the following short-term deposit ratings – P-1 from Moody’s Investor Service, Inc., A1 from Standard & Poor’s Corporation, and F-1 from Fitch Ratings,
Inc. and (B) a combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than $10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then-publicly available) and, in any such case, no such instrument will have a maturity exceeding three months, provided further, that no
such investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will become part of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder
will, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Company pursuant to Section 2.2(f). To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent will promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events
so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.
Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Stock Plans.
(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (an “Option”) that is outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) will be converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Company an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock set forth in such Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the
“Option Cash Payment”), and as of the Effective Time each holder of an Option will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Option Cash Payment. The Option Cash Payment will be made promptly (and no later than 10 Business Days) following the Effective Time.
(b) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan (other than awards of Options, the treatment of which is specified in Section 2.3(a)) entitling the
holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of Shares (a “Share Unit”) that is outstanding or payable as
of the Effective Time will be converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Company the Merger Consideration, less any required
withholding Taxes in respect of a number of shares of Company Common Stock determined as follows (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “Share Unit
Payment”) (i) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the target number of shares of Company Common Stock, and
(ii) in the case of Share Units not subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Share Units. As of the Effective Time each holder of a Share Unit will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Share Unit Payment. The Share Unit Payment
Annex A-6
Table of Contents
will be made promptly (and no later than 10 Business Days) following the Effective Time, other than payment with respect to the Share Units set forth on
Section 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which shall be paid on the terms and conditions set forth on such Section of the Company Disclosure
Letter.
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take lawful actions as may be necessary (which include satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act), without incurring any liability in connection therewith, to provide for and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.3.
Section 2.4 Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that have not been voted in favor of, or consented to,
the adoption of this Agreement and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal and payment of the fair cash
value of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL (“Dissenting Shares”) will not be
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), but at the Effective Time shall instead be cancelled, extinguished
and converted solely into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to the holder of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. If the holder of such Dissenting Shares withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right
of appraisal pursuant to the OGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, such Shares shall be deemed not to be Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to have
been Eligible Shares that were cancelled, extinguished and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
such Share, without interest, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, and subject to Section 2.2. The Company will provide prompt notice to Parent
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served on the Company pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, and Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and Actions with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer or commit to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Section 2.5 Adjustments. If, at any time during the Interim Period, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company occurs as a result of any merger, business combination, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; provided that nothing in this Section 2.5 will be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

respect to any of the foregoing actions.
(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement will give any Parent Party or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party’s
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent or the Company will be required with respect to any matter set forth in this
Section 5.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement of such consent would, upon the advice of outside legal counsel, violate
applicable Antitrust Law.
Section 5.2 No Solicitation by the Company.
(a) From the Agreement Date until the Effective Time, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2, the Company will not, and the Company will cause
each of its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage, knowingly induce, knowingly assist, or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the submission or announcement by any
Person of, any proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, the submission of any Takeover
Proposal (provided, however, that the
Annex A-33
Table of Contents
Company, its Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives may refer the Person making such proposal or offer to the provisions of this Section 5.2); (ii)
furnish any information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person, or afford access to the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’, books,
records or property in connection with a Takeover Proposal; (iii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Takeover Proposal (provided, however, that the Company and its Representatives may refer the Person making any such inquiry, proposal or offer to the
provisions of this Section 5.2); (iv) adopt, approve or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, purchase agreement, or similar document, agreement, or commitment with respect to any Takeover Proposal (a “Company Acquisition
Agreement”), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; or (v) agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that the foregoing
clauses (i) through (v) will not prohibit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending, modifying or granting any waiver or release under any
standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, but solely to the extent necessary to allow for a Takeover
Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company receives a written bona fide written
Takeover Proposal after the Agreement Date that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2(a), then the Company and its Representatives may make
inquiries of such Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) solely to ascertain facts regarding, and clarify the terms of, such
written Takeover Proposal for the purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such Takeover Proposal and the Person making it.
(b) Subject to the remainder of this Section 5.2, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Person, conducted on or prior to the Agreement Date with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, including Section 5.2(a), prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the
Company and its Representatives may following execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person(s), engage or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide any information to, any Person or group of Persons (or its or their Representatives and
financing sources) that has made a bona fide written Takeover Proposal after the Agreement Date that did not result from a material breach of Section
5.2(a) if prior to taking any such action, the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law and that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal. Substantially contemporaneously with providing any non-public information to such Person or group of Persons, the Company will
make such non-public information available to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made available to the Parent
Parties).
(d) The Company will inform Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt thereof) of its receipt of any written inquiry, proposal or offer
with respect to any Takeover Proposal received after the Agreement Date and any written request for non-public information in connection therewith
(indicating the identity of the Person making the inquiry or proposal and the material terms of any such proposal, including providing copies of any
Company Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents) and thereafter will keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
developments regarding any Takeover Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any material development). In the event that any
Person modifies its Takeover Proposal in any material respect (it being understood that any change in financial terms and any formal written modification
shall be deemed material), the Company will notify Parent in writing within 48 hours of receipt of such modification of the fact that such Takeover
Proposal has been modified and the terms
Annex A-34
Table of Contents
of such modification (including, if applicable, providing copies of written documentation reflecting such modification). The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the Agreement Date which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with Section 5.2(c) or this Section 5.2(d).
(e) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.2(f) or Section 5.2(g), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof will (i) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (iii) make any recommendation or public statement in connection with
any tender offer or exchange offer for the Shares other than a recommendation against such offer or a temporary “stop, look and listen” communication
by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Takeover Proposal, or fail to publicly
reaffirm the Company Recommendation, in each case, within 10 Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (or such fewer number of days as
remains prior to the Shareholders Meeting, but in no event shall the Company Board or any committee thereof be required to act on less than two
Business Days’ notice) following a publicly announced Takeover Proposal, provided that Parent may only make such request once with respect to any
particular Takeover Proposal or any material publicly announced or disclosed amendment or modification thereto, (v) adopt, approve or recommend to
shareholders of the Company, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal, or (vi) resolve,
publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (the actions described in the foregoing clauses (e)(i) – (e)(vi) being referred to as a “Change in
Recommendation”).
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 5.2(e), the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation
and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), if: (i) an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal (that did not result from a material
breach of Section 5.2(a)) is made and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that (x) a failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and (y) such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iii) four Business Days have elapsed since the Company has
given written notice to Parent identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal, advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make a Change
in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and providing a copy of any written Company Acquisition Agreement and other definitive transaction agreements proposed to be
entered into in connection therewith, including any definitive financing commitments relating thereto, (iv) during such four Business Day period the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable
Parent to propose in writing an offer binding on Parent to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal
to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (v) following the end of such four Business Day period, the Company Board or any duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof has considered in good faith any such binding offer from Parent, and has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such
binding offer were to be given effect; provided, however, that if, during such four Business Day period, any material revisions are made to the Superior
Proposal (it being understood that a material revision will include any change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior Proposal
and any formal written modification to any other material term of such Superior Proposal), the Company Board will give a new written notice to Parent and
will comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2(f) with respect to such new written notice (provided, that the notice period will be two Business
Days instead of four Business Days), and (vi) prior to taking such action, at the end of such notice period, the Company Board or any duly constituted
and authorized committee thereof has considered in good faith any such binding offer, and has determined in good faith, based on the information then
available and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to make such Change in Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement due to the Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
Annex A-35
Table of Contents
Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The actions of the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof in
making a determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company’s authorizing and providing the notices to Parent
required by this Section 5.2(f), will not in and of itself, constitute a Change in Recommendation, a violation of this Section 5.2 or a termination of this
Agreement.
(g) Prior to the time the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may effect a Change in Recommendation of the type described in Section
5.2(e)(i) or Section 5.2(e)(ii) if: (i) the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) such action is not in response to the receipt, existence of or terms of a Takeover Proposal or
a Superior Proposal or any inquiry related thereto or the consequences thereof (which is governed by Section 5.2(f)); (iii) such action is in response to a
material development, fact, change, event, effect, occurrence or circumstance that (A) is not known or reasonably foreseeable or, if known (or reasonably
foreseeable), the consequences of which are not known or reasonably foreseeable, to the Company Board as of the Agreement Date and becomes known
to the Company Board prior to the time of the Shareholder Approval, (B) does not result from any breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (C) does not relate to the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal (an “Intervening Event”); and (iv) prior to taking such
action, (w) the Company Board has given Parent at least four Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action absent any revision
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice describes the Intervening Event (including the material facts and circumstances thereof) and
the reasons for such intended Change in Recommendation in reasonable detail, (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose in writing an offer binding on the Parent Parties to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement and (y) at the end of such notice period, the
Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has considered in good faith any such binding offer, and has determined in
good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to make such
Change in Recommendation due to the Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The actions of the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof in making a determination that an
Intervening Event necessitates a Change in Recommendation and the Company’s authorizing and providing the notices to Parent required by this Section
5.2(g), will not in and of itself, constitute a Change in Recommendation, a violation of this Section 5.2 or a termination of this Agreement.
(h) Notwithstanding any provisions thereof, nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or in Section 6.6 will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any other disclosure to the Company’s shareholders if, in the Company Board’s determination in good faith after consultation with outside counsel, such
disclosure is required under applicable Law or (ii) issuing a “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that if any such disclosure pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation, it will be
deemed to be a Change in Recommendation.
(i) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement is validly terminated, (x) this Agreement, the Merger and the principal terms
thereof shall be submitted by the Company to the holders of Shares at the Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation and (y) the Company and the Company Board shall not submit
to the holders of Shares any Takeover Proposal or propose to do so.
(j) The Company agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such
Person’s consideration of an acquisition of the Company or
Annex A-36
Table of Contents
any of its Subsidiaries return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives and the Company will immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access for any
such Person and any of its Representatives to diligence or other information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
(k) Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2 by any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 5.2 by the Company.
Section 5.3 DOJ Investigation. The Company shall (i) consult with Parent regarding proposals to, and material negotiations with, the DOJ regarding the
DOJ Investigation and (ii) provide prompt notice to Parent of (A) any material development with the DOJ regarding the DOJ Investigation and (B) the
occurrence of any Specified Outcome.
ARTICLE VI
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
Section 6.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement.
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, the Company will prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary form of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the requirements of applicable Law. The Parent Parties and the Company will reasonably cooperate with one another in connection with the preparation of
the Proxy Statement. The Parent Parties will furnish all information concerning the Parent Parties, SJL and their Affiliates as is required to be included in
the Proxy Statement. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. Subject to Section 5.2, the Proxy Statement will contain the Company
Recommendation.
(b) Each of the Parent and the Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other of (i) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all
other written correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement, and (ii) any request by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto.
(c) The Parent Parties and the Company will each use reasonable best efforts to efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any (written
or oral) comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Except with respect to any disclosure or communication that relates to a Takeover
Proposal or a Change in Recommendation, the Company will provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto or any substantive response to comments received from the SEC in respect thereof (including the proposed final
version of such document or response), in each case, prior to the mailing or submission thereof, and will give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments thereon made by Parent or its counsel.
(d) Until the Shareholder Approval is obtained, if any information relating to the Company, a Parent Party, SJL or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or a Parent Party that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other Parties.
The Company will promptly prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws, disseminate such amendment to the holders of Shares as of the record date established for the
Shareholders Meeting.
Annex A-37
Table of Contents
Section 6.2 Shareholders Meeting.
(a) Subject to Section 5.2, the Company will, in accordance with its constituent documents, the rules of Nasdaq, and applicable Law, duly set a record date
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date the definitive Proxy Statement is disseminated to
the holders of Shares, a meeting of the holders of Shares for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the “Shareholders Meeting”). The Company will consult with Parent regarding the record date and date for holding the
Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn
or postpone the Shareholders Meeting (i) in the absence of a quorum (in person or by proxy) to convene the Shareholders Meeting, (ii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably necessary under applicable Law for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the holders of Shares prior to the Shareholders Meeting, (iii) for a single period not to exceed 20 Business Days to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Company reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Shareholder
Approval, or (iv) if otherwise reasonably required by applicable Law or upon a request by the SEC.
(b) Without the prior written consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement will be the only matter (other than a
non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in
connection with the Transactions and matters of procedure) that the Company will propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the
Shareholders Meeting and the Company will not submit any other proposal to such shareholders in connection with the Shareholders Meeting or
otherwise (including any proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions) (other than, (A) if the
Shareholders Meeting is also the Company’s annual shareholder meeting, proposals customarily brought in connection with the Company’s annual
shareholder meeting, and (B) any matters that are proposed by a shareholder of the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations in
effect on the Agreement Date) and (ii) the Company will not call any meeting of the shareholders of the Company other than the Shareholders Meeting
(other than, if the Company Shareholders Meeting is not combined with the Company’s annual shareholder meeting, the Company’s annual shareholder
meeting). The Company will provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the Shareholders Meeting (including interim results) as
reasonably requested by Parent.
(c) The Parent Parties will vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then beneficially owned by them, SJL or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement.
Section 6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.
(a) The Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to cause each of the conditions in Article VII to be satisfied and consummate and make effective in the most expeditious
manner possible, and prior to the Outside Date, the Transactions (and not have the Transactions unwound after the Effective Time), including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed with any Governmental Entity to consummate the Transactions, (ii) taking
all actions necessary to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity (which actions will include furnishing all information required under the HSR Act, and any other Antitrust Laws or FDI Laws listed
in Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter and in connection with approvals of or filings required by any other Governmental Entity) to be
obtained or made by the Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, and (iv) taking all actions reasonably necessary to avoid that the Transactions are unwound after the Effective Time.
Additionally, the Parties will not, will cause their Subsidiaries to not, and SDB and Parent will cause SJL to not, take any action, or authorize or
Annex A-38
Table of Contents
agree to take or make any commitment to take any action or enter into any Contract that would reasonably be expected to materially impede, materially
interfere with, or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, including (x) acquiring any other Person or business (other
than pursuant to this Agreement) or any material assets or properties of any other Person (whether by merger, tender offer, consolidation, purchase of
property or otherwise) or (y) making any material investment in any other Person or business either by purchase of stock or securities, contributions to
capital, property transfers or purchase of assets or properties of any Person, except in each case of the foregoing clauses (x) or (y) for acquisitions or
investments that would not reasonably be expected to materially impede, materially interfere with or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or
the other Transactions. For purposes of this Section 6.3, Parent and SDB will cause SJL to take all actions that it would be required to take as though it
were a Parent Party under this Agreement.
(b) The Parties will promptly consult with each other with respect to and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, promptly provide each other any
relevant information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide each other (or their counsel) copies of), and keep each other apprised of
the status of, all filings made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied (except with respect to any disclosure or
communication that relates to a Takeover Proposal or a Change in Recommendation), by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; provided, however, that the Parties may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided under this Section 6.3 as “Outside Counsel Only Material.” Such materials designated “Outside
Counsel Only Material” and the information contained therein will be given only to the outside antitrust or FDI counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the Party
that provided the materials or its legal counsel. Anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3 notwithstanding, materials provided pursuant to
this Section 6.3 may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company and the Merger and other confidential
information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or personal privacy
concerns. Each Party will promptly inform the other Parties of any communication (excluding administrative, non-substantive communications) received
by it from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions. If any Party or any Representative of such Party receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such Party will use its reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, promptly and, to the extent permitted by Law, after consultation with the other Parties and permitting counsel to the other
Parties reasonable opportunity to review in advance, an appropriate response to such request. Each Party agrees that it will not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the performance of its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.3 unless it consults, in the case of the Company, with Parent, and in the case of a Parent Party, with the Company, in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives such other Party the opportunity to attend and participate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of any dispute between the Parties relating to the strategy or appropriate course of action or content of any submission made in
connection with obtaining any clearances under applicable Antitrust Laws and applicable FDI Laws with respect to the Transactions, the Parties will
escalate such dispute to the chief executive officers of the Company and SDB for resolution. If such dispute is not resolved pursuant to the preceding
sentence, the Company and the Parent shall jointly devise the strategy and direct all matters for obtaining clearances, approvals or waiting-period
expirations under Antitrust Laws and applicable FDI Laws, including any filings, notifications, submissions and communication with or to any
Governmental Entity in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.3 or in any other provision of this Agreement,
the Parent Parties will consult with the Company prior to taking any material substantive position in any written submissions or, to the extent practicable,
discussions with any Governmental Entity.
(c) The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 10 Business Days after
the Agreement Date, notifications under the HSR Act, and the
Annex A-39
Table of Contents
Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than the earlier of 30
Business Days after the Agreement Date or the date as required by applicable Law, any other filings and/or notifications under the Antitrust Laws and
FDI Laws listed in Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and in each case, if applicable, requesting early termination of any waiting period with
respect to the Transactions, and to file as soon as practicable any other applicable notifications or other forms and documentation necessary to obtain
any consents, clearances or approvals under or in connection with any applicable Antitrust Law or applicable FDI Laws listed in Section 7.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter or in connection with the approval or authorization of or filings with any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made
by the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement the
failure of which to obtain or be made would result in the failure of a closing condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied. The Parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to respond, as promptly as practicable, to any inquiries and requests received from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, CFIUS, or any other Governmental Entity concerning applicable Antitrust Laws or FDI Laws for additional
information or documentation. The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to respond, as promptly as practicable, to all inquiries and requests for
additional information and documentation received from any state Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity in connection with approvals or
filings pursuant to the Antitrust Laws and FDI Laws listed in Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter or approvals of, or filings with, any other
Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement the failure of which to obtain or be made would result in the failure of a closing
condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.
(d) The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions under applicable Antitrust Laws or FDI Laws. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3, in the event that the Parties
receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a “Second Request”), the Parties will use their respective reasonable
best efforts to respond to such Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for each of the Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety
of any such Second Request review process. Further, and for purposes of clarity, the Parent Parties will not propose or consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period, or propose or consent to any voluntary delay of the Transactions, including not extending any
waiting period under the HSR Act (by pull and refile, or otherwise) or any other Antitrust Laws or FDI Laws or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the Merger, except with the prior written consent of the Company. If any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as violative of the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act or any
other United States federal or state or foreign Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, “Antitrust Laws”) or otherwise challenged by any Governmental Entity (excluding under any applicable
FDI Laws), the Parties will cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any Order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other Transactions, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. The
Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods or clearances under the
HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or applicable FDI Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Parent Parties will, and will cause their controlled Affiliates and SJL to, take
any and all actions required to obtain all required approvals under the HSR Act and other approvals under applicable Antitrust Laws and FDI Laws
necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article VII, including the proposal, negotiation and acceptance (including through Order, consent decree,
settlement or otherwise) prior to the Outside Date of (i) any and all divestitures of their businesses or assets or, following the Closing, of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any agreement to hold any of their assets or, following the Closing, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries separate, (iii) any
Annex A-40

agreement to license any portion of their business or assets or, following the Closing, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) any limitation to or
modification of any of their businesses, services or operations or, following the Closing, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (v) any other
action (including any action that limits the freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or ability to retain or hold, any of their businesses,
assets, product lines, properties or services or, following the Closing, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), in each case, as may be required by any
applicable Governmental Entity in order to obtain approval for the Transactions prior to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
6.3(e), neither any of the Parent Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates or SJL are required to commit to or effect (A) any sale, divestiture, lease,
holding separate pending a sale or other transfer or disposal or (B) any other restriction or action contemplated by this Section 6.3(e) if:
(I) in the case of clause (A), such action would require the sale, divestiture, lease, holding separate pending a sale or other transfer or disposal of
the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ non-molecular assay business line, molecular reagent business line or immunological reagent business line or a
sale or other transfer or disposal of any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of the Parent Parties or their respective Subsidiaries
representing, in the aggregate, more than $100,000,000 of annual revenue generated during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021; or
(II) in the case of clause (B), such restriction or action, individually or taken together with all sales, divestitures, leases, holding separate pending a
sale, transfers, disposals and other restrictions and actions contemplated by this Section 6.3(e), in the aggregate would, or would reasonably be
expected to, have a materially adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Parent Parties and their Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.3, neither a Parent Party nor the Company will be required to agree to any term or take any action in
connection with receipt of consents under applicable Antitrust Laws or FDI Laws that is not conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.
Section 6.4 Notification of Certain Matters. Subject to applicable Law, the Company will give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties
will give prompt notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence would be reasonably
likely to cause any condition to the Merger of the Party receiving such notice to be unsatisfied and (b) any material failure of the Company or any Parent
Party, as the case may be, or any Representative of the Company or Parent Party, as applicable, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the Party receiving such notice. The Company will promptly notify Parent of any written
notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person in connection with a Material Contract is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions.
Section 6.5 Access; Confidentiality. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, the Company
agrees to provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries to provide, Parent and its Representatives, from time to time during the Interim Period, reasonable access
during normal business hours to (a) the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective properties (but excluding for purposes of any invasive, soil sample or
below ground testing), books, Tax Returns and Tax records, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and (b) such other information as Parent
reasonably requests with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial condition and operations, in each case,
to the extent related to the consummation of the Transactions or the ownership or operation of the respective businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries will be required to provide the Parent
Parties or their Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i) that would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or third parties, (ii) that would result in the disclosure of competitively sensitive sales or marketing information of third parties or
violate any of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ obligations with respect to confidentiality that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality or other
agreement with a third party (provided that
Annex A-41
Table of Contents
the Company notifies Parent of such confidentiality restrictions and, if requested by Parent, uses commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Parent to provide the information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not violate the underlying confidentiality agreement), (iii) the disclosure of
which would violate any Law (provided, that, if requested by Parent, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in such violation), (iv) that would result in the loss of attorney-client or other legal
privilege (provided that, if requested by Parent, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to provide the information
in a manner that does not result in such loss of privilege), (v) that is competitively sensitive to the Company or its Subsidiaries (provided that the Parties
will attempt to establish a clean team process to share such materials in a commercially reasonable manner) or (vi) except as otherwise expressly required
by this Agreement, information that relates to (1) the negotiation of this Agreement, (2) the amount of the Merger Consideration or the valuation of the
Company in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions or any other financial or strategic alternatives considered by the Company Board, (3) any
Takeover Proposal, (4) any process the Company has conducted with any financial advisor or other communications with any Persons in connection
therewith prior to the Agreement Date, or (5) the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board or any committee thereof discussing the Transactions or
any similar transaction between the Company and any other Person (including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the Company
Board or any committee thereof, whether in connection with a specific meeting thereof or otherwise relating to such subject matter). The Company and its
Subsidiaries will not be required to provide information in any format other than as then exists, or otherwise to manipulate or reconfigure any data
regarding the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ business, assets, financial performance or condition or operations. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) the Company will not be required to provide any access or make any disclosure pursuant to this Section
6.5 to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to an Action where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties or reasonably likely to become adverse parties and (y) the
Company may satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under
applicable Law or as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures. No representation or warranty as to the accuracy of information provided
pursuant to this Section 6.5 is made and the Parent Parties may not rely on the accuracy of such information except to the extent expressly set forth in the
representations and warranties included in Article III. All information provided will be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Section 6.6 Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger will be a joint press release in a form previously agreed to by Parent and the Company
and issued promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties. Neither the Company nor the Parent Parties will (and Parent will
cause SJL to not) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement or disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior consultation of the other Party (with such consultation to include giving the other Party the opportunity to review and
comment on such press release or other announcement and for the Party making such disclosure to consider in good faith the comments of such other
Party), except (a) to the extent required by Law, (b) with respect to communications by the Company with any Company employees, (c) in connection with
any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, or (d) required by any listing agreement with or rules of any applicable
national securities exchange, trading market or listing authority, or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the Company
will not be required by this Section 6.6 to provide any such review or comment to the Parent Parties in connection with the receipt and existence of, or
public release with respect to, a Takeover Proposal or a Change in Recommendation and matters related thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, a Party may, without consultation with the other Party, issue one or more press releases or public statements and
respond to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so long as such press releases,
public statements or other statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by the Company or Parent Parties in compliance with this Section 6.6 that are consistent with prior press releases issued or public
statements made in compliance with this Section 6.6 or any communication plan or strategy previously agreed to by Parent and the Company. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.6 will prevent Parent
Annex A-42

Parties or the Company from issuing any press release or making any public statement in the ordinary course that does not relate specifically to this
Agreement or the Transactions.
Section 6.7 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.
(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Parent Parties will, and will cause
the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director or officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, or any
other Person that is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Company, together with such
person’s heirs, executors or administrators, (the “Indemnified Party”) with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties,
costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred in
connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on
or arising out of, in whole or in part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or any such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person) or (ii) acts or omissions by such Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Party’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company
or a Subsidiary of the Company or taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under (i) or (ii), at, or at any time prior to,
the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Merger or the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law or that the Company would have been required
under its articles of incorporation or code of regulations in effect on the Agreement Date (and made available to the Parent Parties), to indemnify such
Indemnified Party. In addition, from the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time, the Parent Parties will, and will cause the Surviving Company
to, advance any expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnified Party under this Section 6.7 (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 6.7) as incurred to the fullest extent that the Company would
have been required under its articles of incorporation or code of regulations, in each case, as in effect on the Agreement Date, if the individual to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
this Section 6.7(a).
(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will assume all obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in respect of rights of
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the respective constituent documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or in any written Contract described on the Company Disclosure Letter or filed as an exhibit to any document filed with the SEC;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made in accordance with the applicable
provisions thereof will continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parent Parties, from
and after the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time, will cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the articles of incorporation and code of
regulations or similar organizational documents of the Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect
to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the Agreement Date in the Company’s constituent
documents, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnified Parties.
(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Parent Parties will either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies or purchase or
cause the
Annex A-43
Table of Contents
Surviving Company to purchase, a “tail policy” with reputable insurers, in each case of at least the same coverage and scope, and in amounts, and
containing terms and conditions, that are no less favorable to such individuals than such policy in effect on the Agreement Date, with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
after the Effective Time, the Parent Parties will not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the Agreement Date in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case will purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; and provided further, that if the Surviving Company purchases a “tail policy” and the same coverage costs on
an annual basis more than 300% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Company will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be
obtained for 300% of such last annual premium. The Company may prior to the Effective Time purchase a six-year prepaid “tail policy” on terms and
conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company will not pay an aggregate amount for such policy in excess of 300% of the current aggregate
annual premium paid by the Company for the existing policy, and the Company will reasonably consult with Parent regarding the purchase of such “tail
policy” prior to the purchase of such “tail policy”. If such prepaid “tail policy” has been obtained by the Company, it will be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.7(c) and the Surviving Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 will survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such individual may have under the Company’s constituent documents, by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Parent
Parties and the Surviving Company under this Section 6.7 may not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.7 applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnified
Party has consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.7 applies
will be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7).
(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
is not the continuing or surviving company or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.
Section 6.8 Parent and Company Compliance. Whenever this Agreement requires SJL to take any action or refrain from taking an action, such requirement
will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of each of the Parent Parties to cause SJL to take such action or refrain from such action. For
purposes of this Section 6.8, SDB and Parent will be deemed to have the ability to control SJL and to cause it to take an action required to be taken under
this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires Parent or Merger Sub to take an action or refrain from taking an action, such requirement will be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of SDB to cause each of Parent and Merger Sub (including by causing SJL to cause each of Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable) to take such action or refrain from such action and shall ensure that each of Parent and Merger Sub have sufficient resources
in connection therewith. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement will be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

Section 6.9 Employee Matters.
(a) From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent will provide, or will cause to be provided, to each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who was an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company
Employees”) (i) cash compensation that is no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the cash compensation provided to each such Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time, which shall be increased to reflect the annual grant value of any equity compensation that such Company
Employee was eligible to receive prior to the Closing to the extent comparable long-term incentive compensation is not provided to such Company
Employee following the Closing, (ii) health, welfare and retirement benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the health, welfare and
retirement benefits provided to each such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) severance benefits upon a termination
without cause and subject to a release of claims that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the severance benefits provided to each such Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time.
(b) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect and make payment under all annual bonus plans that were
in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs without modification of the terms or performance criteria
related thereto.
(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect the Company’s defined contribution 401(k) plan in accordance with past practice for the
fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, including approving and effecting an employer profit sharing contribution for such fiscal year in an amount equal
to 1.5% of adjusted operating income, to be allocated among eligible participants in accordance with the plan’s provisions.
(d) From and after the Closing, Parent will cause the Surviving Company to assume and perform the Company’s obligations under the Contracts set forth
on Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(e) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual (other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan sponsored by Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee will be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries or predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee
was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing will not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company
Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Transactions (such plans,
collectively, the “Old Plans”); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent will cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and
his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan.
(f) Nothing in this Section 6.9 will (i) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of
its Affiliates, including the Surviving Company, from
Annex A-45
Table of Contents
amending or terminating any specific employee benefit plan or terminating the employment of any individual at any time and for any reason. The
provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the respective Parties and nothing in this Section 6.9, express or implied, will confer upon any
Covered Employee, Company Employee, or any other Person (other than the Parties), any third party beneficiary or other rights or remedies, including
any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement.
Section 6.10 Merger Sub Approval. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent will execute and deliver, in accordance with Section

minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.
Section 6.12 Shareholder Litigation. In the event that any shareholder litigation related to this Agreement or the Transactions is brought, or, to the

as practicable after the Effective Time and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after such delisting.
Section 6.14 Section 16 Matters. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any dispositions of shares of Company Common

Law.

or to become inaccurate; (vi) to take any action or provide any assistance that involves preparing or providing to the Parent Parties or any Financing
Sources any financial statements or other information that is not reasonably available to, or may not be readily produced from their books and records, or

breach of this Section 6.15 by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective directors, officers or employees, including the ability to
assert a breach of this Section 6.15 as the basis of the failure of a condition to the Closing set forth in Article VII, other than a willful and material breach

written notice of such breach describing in reasonable detail the circumstances of such breach. For purposes of this Agreement (i) “Financing Source”
means each Person (including each agent and

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1(d)(i) or if either Parent or the Company terminates this

Annex A-51
Table of Contents

Takeover Proposal except that all references to 20% will be deemed references to 50%), then (in any of the foregoing clauses (i) – (iv)), the Company will
pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds (x) in the case of
such termination by Parent, within two Business Days after such termination, (y) in the case of such termination by the Company, prior to or substantially

will have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party is entitled to contemporaneously seek both specific performance pursuant to
Section 9.11 and the payment of monetary damages (including in connection with the provisions of Section 8.2(a)) as alternative remedies for a breach of
this Agreement by (i) the Parent Parties in the case of the Company or (ii) the Company in the case of the Parent Parties, provided, however, that no Party
will be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance requiring consummation of the Transactions (pursuant to which the Merger actually
occurs) pursuant to Section 9.11 and payment of monetary damages pursuant to Section 8.2(a) with respect to the another applicable Party’s failure to
consummate the Transactions when required pursuant to Section 1.2.

Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (b) except for the provisions in Section 6.7, (which provisions may be enforced directly by

representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the Parties and may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of this Agreement. Accordingly, Persons
other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of
the Agreement Date or as of any other date.
Section 9.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, the
Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible and the Parties agree
that the court making such determination will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete

action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) are governed by and will be
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the

agree that the claimant in any arbitration shall have the right to select the use of those Expedited Procedure Rules in any arbitration, regardless of
the amount in controversy, at its sole election.
(ii) The arbitration shall be conducted before three arbitrators (each, an “Arbitrator” and collectively, the “Tribunal”). One Arbitrator shall be
selected by the Company and one Arbitrator by Parent. The third Arbitrator (the “Chair”) shall be selected by the other two Arbitrators, or by the

Party’s own independent auditors or insurers, or in

proceedings seeking the enforcement or vacatur of an arbitral award, no Party may disclose the existence, contents or results of an arbitration
brought in accordance with this Agreement, or the documents presented and evidence produced by its opposing Parties, or any analyses or
summaries derived from such evidence. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Law, the arbitration shall be considered and
treated by the Parties as a confidential proceeding.
(b) Each Party hereby agrees that this Agreement does not preclude any Party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of
competent jurisdiction, in addition to through the interim and emergency relief procedures prescribed by the ICC Rules.
(c) Delivery of process or other papers in the manner provided in Section 9.4 (Notices) in connection with any Action under this Agreement or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Law will be valid and sufficient service thereof, and each Party irrevocably waives any defenses it may have to
service in such manner.
(d) The Parties acknowledge that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event is anything in this Section 9.10 intended to limit, or shall be construed to limit,
in any manner, the Parties’ rights to seek specific performance as set forth in Section 9.11.
Section 9.11 Specific Performance. The Parties hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that each Party will be entitled to, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement. The
Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any of the Parties, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. The Parties further agree
that (x) by seeking the equitable remedy of specific performance, a Party will not waive in any respect its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a Party under this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the equitable remedy of specific performance is not available or otherwise is not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this
Section 9.11 will require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party’s right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this
Section 9.11 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor will the
commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section 9.11 or anything set forth in this Section 9.11 restrict or limit any Party’s right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies that may be available then or thereafter.

Cincinnati, OH 45244
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that SD Biosensor, Inc. (“SDB”), Columbus Holding Company (“Parent”), Madeira Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Sub”), and Meridian Bioscience, Inc. (the “Company”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”),
which provides, among other things, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the “Transaction”), pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of the Company
(each, a “Company Share”), other than Cancelled Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $34.00 in cash (the
“Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) has requested our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Company Shares in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In arriving at our opinion set forth below, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed the draft of the Agreement dated July 6, 2022 provided to the Board
in connection with its meeting on July 6, 2022; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information that we deemed to be generally
relevant concerning the Company and the industry in which it operates, including certain publicly available research analyst reports and the reported
price and historical trading activity for the Company Shares; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available
financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed generally relevant and the consideration received in such transactions; (iv)
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other public companies we
deemed generally relevant, including data related to public market trading levels and implied trading multiples; (v) reviewed certain internal financial and
operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts relating to the
Company prepared by the management of the Company (the “Forecasts”); and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered
such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the
management of the Company regarding the Transaction, the past and current business operations and financial condition and prospects of the Company,
the Forecasts and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
In arriving at our opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all
information that was publicly available or was furnished or made available to us by the Company and its associates, affiliates and advisors, or otherwise
reviewed by or for us, and we have not assumed any responsibility or liability therefor. We have not conducted any valuation or appraisal of any assets
or liabilities of the Company, nor have any such valuations or appraisals been provided to

us, and we do not express any opinion as to the value of such assets or liabilities. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, SDB
or Parent under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In addition, we have not assumed any obligation to
conduct any physical inspection of the properties or the facilities of the Company, SDB or Parent. At the direction of the management of the Company, we
have used and relied upon the Forecasts for purposes of our opinion. In relying on the Forecasts, we have assumed, at the direction of the Company, that
they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by the Company’s
management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company. We express no view as to the reasonableness of the
Forecasts and the assumptions on which they are based.
We have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as contemplated in the Agreement without any waiver or
amendment of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the parties will comply with all material terms of the Agreement and that in
connection with the receipt of all necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the Transaction, no material delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed. For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have assumed that there has not occurred any material
change in the assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Company since the date of the most recent financial
statements and other information, financial or otherwise, relating to the Company made available to us, and that there is no information or any facts that
would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or misleading. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that
may result from the Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters. We have relied as to all legal, tax and
regulatory matters relevant to rendering our opinion upon the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with respect to such issues. In
arriving at our opinion, we have not taken into account any litigation, regulatory or other proceeding that is pending or may be brought against the
Company or any of its affiliates. In addition, we have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the final form of the Agreement will
not differ in any material respect from the draft of the Agreement reviewed by us.
Our opinion is necessarily based on securities markets, economic, monetary, financial and other general business and financial conditions as they exist
and can be evaluated on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and the conditions and prospects, financial and otherwise, of the
Company as they were reflected in the information provided to us and as they were represented to us in discussions with the management of the
Company. We are expressing no opinion herein as to the price at which the Company Shares will trade at any future time. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Shares of the Merger Consideration payable to such holders in the Transaction
pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any opinion as to the Company’s underlying business decision to engage in the Transaction or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative transaction. We have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to the terms,
other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly set forth herein, of the Transaction, the Agreement or any other agreement entered into in
connection with the Transaction.
We and our affiliates are engaged in a wide range of financial advisory and investment banking activities. In addition, in the ordinary course of their asset
management, merchant banking and other business activities, our affiliates may trade in the securities of the Company, Parent, SDB, SJL Partners, LLC
(“SJL”), the sole shareholder of Parent, and any of their respective affiliates, for their own accounts or for the accounts of their affiliates and customers,
and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. We are acting as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the Transaction
and will receive a fee from the Company for our

services, a portion of which is payable upon delivery of this opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the
Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise out of
our engagement. We and our affiliates may in the future provide financial services to the Company, Parent, SDB, SJL and/ or their respective affiliates in
the ordinary course of our businesses from time to time and may receive fees for the rendering of such services.
This opinion is provided for the benefit of the Board in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion should not
be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on our part to any party. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to whether to
approve the Transaction or a recommendation as to how any holder of Company Shares should vote or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or
any other matter. In addition, the Board has not asked us to address, and this opinion does not address, (i) the fairness to, or any other consideration of,
the holders of any class of securities (other than holders of Company Shares and then only to the extent expressly set forth herein) or creditors or other
constituencies of the Company or (ii) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or
employees of SDB, Parent, the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Agreement or
otherwise.
This opinion is given and speaks only as of the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and the
assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. This opinion has been approved by the
Global Advisory Commitment Committee of Rothschild & Co US Inc.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company
Shares in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Rothschild & Co US Inc.
